,Global,Aaron Swartz,July 2008,"Written by Aaron Swarts in Eremo, Italy, in 2008, the <em>Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto</em> advocates for the liberation of academic research from private corporations. By declaring the formation of a 'open access movement,' Swartz outlines a number of possible avenues for accessing and sharing copy-righted information beyond the limitations of the companies that 'own' it.",,EN,,,"<a href=""https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt"">https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt</a>","Open Access, Copy-left","Guerilla Open Access Manifesto 

Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves. The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the sciences? You'll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier. 

There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. Everything up until now will have been lost. 

That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? 
Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? It's outrageous and unacceptable. 

""I agree,"" many say, ""but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it's perfectly legal — there's nothing we can do to stop them."" But there is something we can, something that's already being done: we can fight back. 

Those with access to these resources — students, librarians, scientists — you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out. But you need not — indeed, morally, you cannot — keep this privilege for yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords with colleagues, filling download requests for friends. 


Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information locked up by the publishers and sharing them with your friends. 

But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. It's called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a 
ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn't immoral — it's a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy. 

Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which they operate require it — their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the politicians they  have bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who can make copies. 

There is no justice in following unjust laws. It's time to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture. 

We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need 
to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access. 

With enough of us, around the world, we'll not just send a strong message opposing the privatization of knowledge — we'll make it a thing of the past. Will you join us?

We've tried to ignore the problem... I tried to ignore the problem. I wanted to ignore the politics of the internet and, in many ways, politics itself. From a netizen point of view, Democracy often seems inefficient and ineffectual. But just because WE want to ignore it, doesn't mean politics wants to ignore us.

There are many groups who would subjugate us if they could. They would force us to pay every time we heard a song on the car radio, they would make sure we can't speak freely about their brand or their brand of government, they would exert complete control over our online existence.

As Netizens, we naively think that calmer heads will prevail and this has often been the case... but laws like SOPA and PIPA, which could potentially make the Patriot Act look tame if used to their fullest extent... continue to be paid for by big industry and pushed through congress. These acts are not just bad, they are unAmerican and more akin to something we would see in China or Iran... not here.

How does this happen? It's simple enough, Congressmen are paid to make laws that would oppress us. In the emerging world, this would be called ""Corruption""... here it's called ""Contribution"". It's easy. These laws are complicated and their most of their constituents don't even know that their congressmen are involved or how these laws would affect them. The industries behind these laws are wealthy and spend lavishly on representatives willing to support them. Most importantly... there is little to no political pain for these representatives. They fill their campaign coffers with cash... if the bill fails, they keep the cash and it's quickly forgotten. If the bill passes, they'll get more money next year. 

This needs to stop.

We can no longer expect our representatives, many of whom couldn't write an email on their own, to represent us without firm action. We can no longer depend on OUR means of discussion - Facebook, Twitter, and Email -l to express ourselves.

We need to fight these laws, and the lawmakers that would pass them, in their back yard. We need to earn their respect, and fear if necessary. We need them to know that supporting these bills has a political cost.

We need a sort of ""Internet Protection Fund"", a PAC, that is designed for a single purpose - To use every legal means to attack those who would attack us. To bring the fight to to their doorstep, their airwaves, and their TVs. We need to organize and focus the resistance. 

Step 1 - Stop the SOPA and PIPA before they are passed through targeted boycotts, information campaigns, and letter writing campaigns.

Step 2 - Target those in Congress who support these bills and attempt to unseat them in the fall with internet, grassroots, TV and Radio campaigns. Congress needs to know that supporting these bills is no longer a blank check...it's no longer safe.

Step 3 - We need to build our organization BETWEEN elections, build its resources, and build its capacity to defend our rights... aggressively. This fight is about to intensify as the information age matures. We need to begin to take an active role in shaping our online future.

This is not a replacement for organizations like the Electronic Freedom Foundation... without whom we will be already be in virtual chains. This is the sharp end of the stick that comes when they are not able to negotiate our freedom. These are the troops that back up the political discussions with real, tangible, action. 

This is not a replacement for Anonymous. They play harder than we will. We will keep our fight within the confines of the current laws. We will use every means within those laws to express the will of those we represent but we will stay well within the confines of the current rules. 

We will play by the political rules that our opponents play by... not the ones we wish they would play. We will use our skills, connections and ability to organize online but we will bring this fight to their field and beat them there.

So now what do we do? 

Step one: +1 this post and pass it on. If there is enough interest, the next steps will be somewhat obvious (begin the organization structure). Comment and let me know what you think and what you would do next. If there is enough interest... more posts will follow.﻿",<em>The Manifesto</em>,,,2014-06-01T23:23:28+00:00,1,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/1,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=4,4,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-25T21:24:37+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,SOPA,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/4

        Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.  ""Teenager
Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal"", ""Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering""...
        Damn kids.  They're all alike.

        But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain,
ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
        I am a hacker, enter my world...
        Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of
the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...
        Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.

        I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers explain
for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  ""No, Ms.
Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in my head...""
        Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all alike.

        I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is
cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...
                Or feels threatened by me...
                Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
                Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
        Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.

        And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through
the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is
sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is
found.
        ""This is it... this is where I belong...""
        I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to
them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...
        Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.  They're all alike...

        You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at
school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip
through were pre-chewed and tasteless.  We've been dominated by sadists, or
ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to teach found us will-
ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.

        This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and

that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me

Here's the ""Crypto Anarchist Manifesto"" I read at the September 1992 founding meeting.

I later gave talks at Hackers on this in 1989 and 1990.

There are a few things I'd change, but for historical reasons I'll just leave it as is. Some of the terms may be unfamiliar to you...I hope the Crypto Glossary I just distributed will help.

The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto

Timothy C. May <tcmay@netcom.com>
A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.

Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re- routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.

The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now been on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under development will be some of the enabling technologies.

The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.

Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.

Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!

McKenzie Wark

Manifestation

01. There is a double spooking the world, the double of abstraction. The fortunes of states and armies, companies and communities depend on it. All contending classes - the landlords and farmers, the workers and capitalists - revere yet fear the relentless abstraction of the world on which their fortunes yet depend. All the classes but one. The hacker class.

02. Whatever code we hack, be it programming language, poetic language, math or music, curves or colourings, we create the possibility of new things entering the world. Not always great things, or even good things, but new things. In art, in science, in philosophy and culture, in any production of knowledge where data can be gathered, where information can be extracted from it, and where in that information new possibilities for the world are produced, there are hackers hacking the new out of the old. While hackers create these new worlds, we do not possess them. That which we create is mortgaged to others, and to the interests of others, to states and corporations who control the means for making worlds we alone discover. We do not own what we produce - it owns us.

03. And yet we don't quite know who we are. While we recognise our distinctive existence as a group, as programmers, as artists or writers or scientists or musicians, we rarely see these ways of representing ourselves as mere fragments of a class experience that is still struggling to express itself as itself, as expressions of the process of producing abstraction in the world. Geeks and freaks become what they are negatively, through their exclusion by others. Hackers are a class, but an abstract class, a class as yet to hack itself into manifest existence as itself.

Abstraction

04. Abstraction may be discovered or produced, may be material or immaterial, but abstraction is what every hack produces and affirms. To abstract is to construct a plane upon which otherwise different and unrelated matters may be brought into many possible relations. It is through the abstract that the virtual is identified, produced and released. The virtual is not just the potential latent in matters, it is the potential of potential. To hack is to produce or apply the abstract to information and express the possibility of new worlds.

05. All abstractions are abstractions of nature. To abstract is to express the virtuality of nature, to make known some instance of its manifold possibilities, to actualise a relation out of infinite relationality. Abstractions release the potential of physical matter. And yet abstraction relies on something that has an independent existence to physical matter -- information. Information is no less real than physical matter, and is dependent on it for its existence. Since information cannot exist in a pure, immaterial form, neither can the hacker class. Of necessity it must deal with a ruling class that owns the material means of extracting or distributing information, or with a producing class that extracts and distributes. The class interest of hackers lies in freeing information from its material constraints.

06. As the abstraction of private property was extended to information, it produced the hacker class as a class. Hackers must sell their capacity for abstraction to a class that owns the means of production, the vectoralist class - the emergent ruling class of our time. The vectorialist class is waging an intensive struggle to dispossess hackers of their intellectual property. Patents and copyrights all end up in the hands, not of their creators, but of the vectoralist class that owns the means of realising the value of these abstractions. The vectoralist class struggles to monopolise abstraction. Hackers find themselves dispossessed both individually, and as a class. Hackers come piecemeal to struggle against the particular forms in which abstraction is commodified and made into the private property of the vectoralist class. Hackers come to struggle collectively against the usurious charges the vectoralists extort for access to the information that hackers collectively produce, but that vectoralists collectively come to own. Hackers come as a class to recognise their class interest is best expressed through the struggle to free the production of abstraction not just from the particular fetters of this or that form of property, but to abstract the form of property itself.

07. What makes our times different is that what now appears on the horizon is the possibility of a society finally set free from necessity, both real and imagined, by an explosion in abstract innovations. Abstraction with the potential once and for all to break the shackles holding hacking fast to outdated and regressive class interests. The time is past due when hackers must come together with all of the producing classes of the world - to liberate productive and inventive resources from the myth of scarcity. ""The world already possesses the dream of a time whose consciousness it must now possess in order to actually live it.""

Production

08. Production produces all things, and all producers of things. Production produces not only the object of the production process, but also the producer as subject. Hacking is the production of production. The hack produces a production of a new kind, which has as its result a singular and unique product, and a singular and unique producer. Every hacker is at one and the same time producer and product of the hack, and emerges in its singularity as the memory of the hack as process.

09. Production takes place on the basis of a prior hack which gives to production its formal, social, repeatable and reproducible form. Every production is a hack formalised and repeated on the basis of its representation. To produce is to repeat; to hack, to differentiate.

10. The hack produces both a useful and a useless surplus, although the usefulness of any surplus is socially and historically determined. The useful surplus goes into expanding the realm of freedom wrested from necessity. The useless surplus is the surplus of freedom itself, the margin of free production unconstrained by production for necessity.

11. The production of a surplus creates the possibility of the expansion of freedom from necessity. But in class society, the production of a surplus also creates new necessities. Class domination takes the form of the capture of the productive potential of society and its harnessing to the production, not of liberty, but of class domination itself. The ruling class subordinates the hack to the production of forms of production that may be harnessed to the enhancement of class power, and the suppression or marginalisation of other forms of hacking. What the producing classes - farmers, workers and hackers - have in common is an interest in freeing production from its subordination to ruling classes who turn production into the production of new necessities, who wrest slavery from surplus. The elements of a free productivity exist already in an atomised form, in the productive classes. What remains is the release of its virtuality.

Class

12. The class struggle, in its endless setbacks, reversals and compromises returns again and again to the unanswered question - property - and the contending classes return again and again with new answers. The working class questioned the necessity of private property, and the communist party arose, claiming to answer the desires of the working class. The answer, expressed in the Communist Manifesto was to ""centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the state."" But making the state the monopolist of property has only produced a new ruling class, and a new and more brutal class struggle. But perhaps this was not the final answer, and the course of the class struggle is not yet over. Perhaps there is another class that can pose the property question in a new way - and offer new answers to breaking the monopoly of the ruling classes on property.

13. There is a class dynamic driving each stage of the development of the vectoral world in which we now find ourselves. The pastoralist class disperse the great mass of peasants who traditionally worked the land under the thumb of feudal landlords. The pastoralists supplant the feudal landlords, releasing the productivity of the land which they claim as their private property. As new forms of abstraction make it possible to produce a surplus from the land with fewer and fewer farmers, pastoralists turn them off their land, depriving them of their living. Dispossessed farmers seek work and a new home in cities. Here farmers become workers, as capital puts them to work in its factories. Capital as property gives rise to a class of capitalists who own the means of production, and a class of workers, dispossessed of it - and by it. Dispossessed farmers become workers, only to be dispossessed again. Having lost their land, they lose in turn their culture. Capital produces in its factories not just the necessities of existence, but a way of life it expects its workers to consume. Commodified life dispossess the worker of the information traditionally passed on outside the realm of private property as culture, as the gift of one generation to the next, and replaces it with information in commodified form.

14. Information, like land or capital, becomes a form of property monopolised by a class of vectoralists, so named because they control the vectors along which information is abstracted, just as capitalists control the material means with which goods are produced, and pastoralists the land with which food is produced. Information circulated within working class culture as a social property belonging to all. But when information in turn becomes a form of private property, workers are dispossessed of it, and must buy their own culture back from its owners, the vectoralist class. The whole of time, time itself, becomes a commodified experience.

15. Vectoralists try to break capital's monopoly on the production process, and subordinate the production of goods to the circulation of information. The leading corporations divest themselves of their productive capacity, as this is no longer a source of power. Their power lies in monopolising intellectual property - patents and brands - and the means of reproducing their value - the vectors of communication. The privatisation of information becomes the dominant, rather than a subsidiary, aspect of commodified life. As private property advances from land to capital to information, property itself becomes more abstract. As capital frees land from its spatial fixity, information as property frees capital from its fixity in a particular object.

16. The hacker class, producer of new abstractions, becomes more important to each successive ruling class, as each depends more and more on information as a resource. The hacker class arises out of the transformation of information into property, in the form of intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyright and the moral right of authors. The hacker class is the class with the capacity to create not only new kinds of object and subject in the world, not only new kinds of property form in which they may be represented, but new kinds of relation beyond the property form. The formation of the hacker class as a class comes at just this moment when freedom from necessity and from class domination appears on the horizon as a possibility.

Property

17. Property constitutes an abstract plane upon which all things may be things with one quality in common, the quality of property. Land is the primary form of property. Pastoralists acquire land as private property through the forced dispossession of peasants who once shared a portion of it in a form of public ownership. Capital is the secondary form of property, the privatisation of productive assets in the form of tools, machines and working materials. Capital, unlike land, is not in fixed supply or disposition. It can be made and remade, moved, aggregated and dispersed. An infinitely greater degree of potential can be released from the world as a productive resource once the abstract plane of property includes both land and capital - such is capital's 'advance'.

18. The capitalist class recognises the value of the hack in the abstract, whereas the pastoralists were slow to appreciate the productivity that can flow from the application of abstraction to the production process. Under the influence of capital, the state sanctions forms of intellectual property, such as patents and copyrights, that secure an independent existence for hackers as a class, and a flow of innovations in culture as well as science from which development issues. Information, once it becomes a form of property, develops beyond a mere support for capital - it becomes the basis of a form of accumulation in its own right.

19. Hackers must calculate their interests not as owners, but as producers, for this is what distinguishes them from the vectoralist class. Hackers do not merely own, and profit by owning information. They produce new information, and as producers need access to it free from the absolute domination of the commodity form. Hacking as a pure, free experimental activity must be free from any constraint that is not self imposed. Only out of its liberty will it produce the means of producing a surplus of liberty and liberty as a surplus.

20. Private property arose in opposition not only to feudal property, but also to traditional forms of the gift economy, which were a fetter to the increased productivity of the commodity economy. Qualitative, gift exchange was superseded by quantified, monetised exchange. Money is the medium through which land, capital, information and labour all confront each other as abstract entities, reduced to an abstract plane of measurement. The gift becomes a marginal form of property, everywhere invaded by the commodity, and turned towards mere consumption. The gift is marginal, but nevertheless plays a vital role in cementing reciprocal and communal relations among people who otherwise can only confront each other as buyer and sellers of commodities. As vectoral production develops, the means appear for the renewal of the gift economy. Everywhere that the vector reaches, it brings into the orbit of the commodity. But everywhere the vector reaches, it also brings with it the possibility of the gift relation.

21. The hacker class has a close affinity with the gift economy. The hacker struggles to produce a subjectivity that is qualitative and singular, in part through the act of the hack itself. The gift, as a qualitative exchange between singular parties allows each party to be recognised as a singular producer, as a subject of production, rather than as a commodified and quantified object. The gift expresses in a social and collective way the subjectivity of the production of production, whereas commodified property represents the producer as an object, a quantifiable commodity like any other, of relative value only. The gift of information need not give rise to conflict over information as property, for information need not suffer the artifice of scarcity once freed from commodification.

22. The vectoralist class contributed, unwittingly, to the development of the vectoral space within which the gift as property could return, but quickly recognised its error. As the vectoral economy develops, less and less of it takes the form of a social space of open and free gift exchange, and more and more of it takes the form of commodified production for private sale. The vectoralist class can grudgingly accommodate some margin of socialised information, as the price it pays in a democracy for the furtherance of its main interests. But the vectoralist class quite rightly sees in the gift a challenge not just to its profits but to its very existence. The gift economy is the virtual proof for the parasitic and superfluous nature of vectoralists as a class.

Vector

23. In epidemiology, a vector is the particular means by which a given pathogen travels from one population to another. Water is a vector for cholera, bodily fluids for HIV. By extension, a vector may be any means by which information moves. Telegraph, telephone, television, telecommunications: these terms name not just particular vectors, but a general abstract capacity that they bring into the world and expand. All are forms of telesthesia, or perception at a distance. A given media vector has certain fixed properties of speed, bandwidth, scope and scale, but may be deployed anywhere, at least in principle. The uneven development of the vector is political and economic, not technical.

24. With the commodification of information comes its vectoralisation. Extracting a surplus from information requires technologies capable of transporting information through space, but also through time. The archive is a vector through time just as communication is a vector that crosses space. The vectoral class comes into its own once it is in possession of powerful technologies for vectoralising information. The vectoral class may commodify information stocks, flows, or vectors themselves. A stock of information is an archive, a body of information maintained through time that has enduring value. A flow of information is the capacity to extract information of temporary value out of events and to distribute it widely and quickly. A vector is the means of achieving either the temporal distribution of a stock, or the spatial distribution of a flow of information. Vectoral power is generally sought through the ownership of all three aspects.

25. The vectoral class ascend to the illusion of an instantaneous and global plane of calculation and control. But it is not the vectoralist class that comes to hold subjective power over the objective world. The vector itself usurps the subjective role, becoming the sole repository of will toward a world that can be apprehended only in its commodified form. The reign of the vector is one in which any and every thing can be apprehended as a thing. The vector is a power over all of the world, but a power that is not evenly distributed. Nothing in the technology of the vector determines its possible use. All that is determined by the technology is the form in which information is objectified.

26. The vectoral class struggles at every turn to maintain its subjective power over the vector, but as it continues to profit by the proliferation of the vector, some capacity over it always escapes control. In order to market and profit by the information it peddles over the vector, it must in some degree address the vast majority of the producing classes as subjects, rather than as objects of commodification. The hacker class seeks the liberation of the vector from the reign of the commodity, but not to set it indiscriminately free. Rather, to subject it to collective and democratic development. The hacker class can release the virtuality of the vector only in principle. It is up to an alliance of all the productive classes to turn that potential to actuality, to organise themselves subjectively, and use the available vectors for a collective and subjective becoming.

Education

27. Education is slavery, it enchains the mind and makes it a resource for class power. When the ruling class preaches the necessity of an education it invariably means an education in necessity. Education is not the same as knowledge. Nor is it the necessary means to acquire knowledge. Education is the organisation of knowledge within the constraints of scarcity. Education 'disciplines' knowledge, segregating it into homogenous 'fields', presided over by suitably 'qualified' guardians charged with policing the representation of the field. One may acquire an education, as if it were a thing, but one becomes knowledgeable, through a process of transformation. Knowledge, as such, is only ever partially captured by education, its practice always eludes and exceeds it.

28. The pastoralist class has resisted education, other than as indoctrination in obedience. When capital required 'hands' to do its dirty work, the bulk of education was devoted to training useful hands to tend the machines, and docile bodies who would accept as natural the social order in which they found themselves. When capital required brains, both to run its increasingly complex operations and to apply themselves to the work of consuming its products, more time spent in the prison house of education was required for admission to the ranks of the paid working class.

29. The so-called middle class achieve their privileged access to consumption and security through education, in which they are obliged to invest a substantial part of their income. But most remain workers, even though they work with information rather than cotton or metal. They work in factories, but are trained to think of them as offices. They take home wages, but are trained to think of it as a salary. They wear a uniform, but are trained to think of it as a suit. The only difference is that education has taught them to give different names to the instruments of exploitation, and to despise those their own class who name them differently.

30. Where the capitalist class sees education as a means to an end, the vectoralist class sees it as an end in itself. It sees opportunities to make education a profitable industry in its own right, based on the securing of intellectual property as a form of private property. To the vectoralists, education, like culture, is just 'content' for commodification.

31. The hacker class have an ambivalent relationship to education. The hacker class desires knowledge, not education. The hacker comes into being though the pure liberty of knowledge in and of itself. The hack expresses knowledge in its virtuality, by producing new abstractions that do not necessarily fit the disciplinary regime of managing and commodifying education. . Hacker knowledge implies, in its practice, a politics of free information, free learning, the gift of the result to a network of peers. Hacker knowledge also implies an ethics of knowledge subject to the claims of public interest and free from subordination to commodity production. This puts the hacker into an antagonistic relationship to the struggle of the capitalist class to make education an induction into wage slavery.

32. Only one intellectual conflict has any real bearing on the class issue for hackers: Whose property is knowledge? Is it the role of knowledge to authorise subjects through education that are recognised only by their function in an economy by manipulating its authorised representations as objects? Or is it the function of knowledge to produce the ever different phenomena of the hack, in which subjects become other than themselves, and discover the objective world to contain potentials other than it appears?

Hacking

33. The virtual is the true domain of the hacker. It is from the virtual that the hacker produces ever-new expressions of the actual. To the hacker, what is represented as being real is always partial, limited, perhaps even false. To the hacker there is always a surplus of possibility expressed in what is actual, the surplus of the virtual. This is the inexhaustible domain of what is real without being actual, what is not but which may be. To hack is to release the virtual into the actual, to express the difference of the real.

34. Through the application of abstraction, the hacker class produces the possibility of production, the possibility of making something of and with the world - and of living off the surplus produced by the application of abstraction to nature - to any nature. Through the production of new forms of abstraction, the hacker class produces the possibility of the future - not just 'the' future, but an infinite possible array of futures, the future itself as virtuality.

35. Under the sanction of law, the hack becomes a finite property, and the hacker class emerges, as all classes emerge, out of a relation to a property form. Like all forms of property, intellectual property enforces a relation of scarcity. It assigns a right to a property to an owner at the expense of non-owners, to a class of possessors at the expense of the dispossessed.

36. By its very nature, the act of hacking overcomes the limits property imposes on it. New hacks supersede old hacks, and devalues them as property. The hack as new information is produced out of already existing information. This gives the hacker class an interest in its free availability more than in an exclusive right. The immaterial nature of information means that the possession by one of information need not deprive another of it.

37. To the extent that the hack embodies itself in the form of property, it gives the hacker class interests quite different from other classes, be they exploiting or exploited classes. The interest of the hacker class lies first and foremost in a free circulation of information, this being the necessary condition for the renewed statement of the hack. But the hacker class as class also has an interest in the representation of the hack as property, as something from which a source of income may be derived that gives the hacker some independence from the ruling classes.

38. The very nature of the hack gives the hacker a crisis of identity. The hacker searches for a representation of what it is to be a hacker in the identities of other classes. Some see themselves as vectoralists, trading on the scarcity of their property. Some see themselves as workers, but as privileged ones in a hierarchy of wage earners. The hacker class has produces itself as itself, but not for itself. It does not (yet) possess a consciousness of its consciousness. It is not aware of its own virtuality. It has to distinguish between its competitive interest in the hack, and its collective interest in discovering a relation among hackers that expresses an open and ongoing future.

Information

39. Information wants to be free but is everywhere in chains. Information is the potential of potential. When unfettered it releases the latent capacities of all things and people, objects and subjects. Information is indeed the very potential for there to be objects and subjects. It is the medium in which objects and subjects actually come into existence, and is the medium in which their virtuality resides. When information is not free, then the class that owns or controls it turns its capacity toward its own interest and away from its own inherent virtuality.

40. Information has nothing to do with communication, or with media. ""We do not lack communication. On the contrary, we have too much of it. We lack creation. We lack resistance to the present."" Information is precisely this resistance, this friction. At the urgings of the vectoralist class, the state recognises as property any communication, any media product with some minimal degree of difference recognisable in commodity exchange. Where communication merely requires the repetition of this commodified difference, information is the production of the difference of difference.

41. The arrest of the free flow of information means the enslavement of the world to the interests of those who profit from information's scarcity, the vectoral class. The enslavement of information means the enslavement of its producers to the interests of its owners. It is the hacker class that taps the virtuality of information, but it is the vectoralist class that owns and controls the means of production of information on an industrial scale. Privatising culture, education and communication as commodified content, distorts and deforms its free development, and prevents the very concept of its freedom from its own free development. While information remains subordinated to ownership, it is not possible for its producers to freely calculate their interests, or to discover what the true freedom of information might potentially produce in the world.

42. Free information must be free in all its aspects - as a stock, as a flow, and as a vector. The stock of information is the raw material out of which history is abstracted. The flow of information is the raw material out of which the present is abstracted, a present that forms the horizon the abstract line of an historical knowledge crosses, indicating a future in its sights. Neither stocks nor flows of information exist without vectors along which they may be actualised. The spatial and temporal axes of free information must do more offer a representation of things, as a thing apart. They must become the means of coordination of the statement of a movement, at once objective and subjective, capable of connecting the objective representation of things to the presentation of a subjective action.

43. It is not just information that must be free, but the knowledge of how to use it. Information in itself is a mere thing. It requires an active, subjective capacity to become productive. Information is free not for the purpose of representing the world perfectly, but for expressing its difference from what is, and for expressing the cooperative force that transforms what is into what may be. The test of a free society is not the liberty to consume information, nor to produce it, nor even to implement its potential in private world of one's choosing. The test of a free society is the liberty for the collective transformation of the world through abstractions freely chosen and freely actualised.

Representation

44. All representation is false. A likeness differs of necessity from what it represents. If it did not, it would be what it represents, and thus not a representation. The only truly false representation is the belief in the possibility of true representation. Critique is not a solution, but the problem itself. Critique is a police action in representation, of service only to the maintenance of the value of property through the establishment of its value.

45. The politics of representation is always the politics of the state. The state is nothing but the policing of representation's adequacy to the body of what it represents. Even in its most radical form, the politics of representation always presupposes an abstract or ideal state that would act as guarantor of its chosen representations. It yearns for a state that would recognise this oppressed ethnicity, or sexuality, but which is nevertheless still a desire for a state, and a state that, in the process, is not challenged as an statement of class interest, but is accepted as the judge of representation.

46. And always, what is excluded even from this enlightened, imaginary state, would be those who refuse representation, namely, the hacker class as a class. To hack is to refuse representation, to make matters express themselves otherwise. To hack is always to produce a difference, if only a minute difference, in the production of information. To hack is to trouble the object or the subject, by transforming in some way the very process of production by which objects and subjects come into being and recognise each other by their representations.

47. The politics of information, of knowledge, advances not through a critical negation of false representations but a positive politics of the virtuality of statement. The inexhaustible surplus of statement is that aspect of information upon which the class interest of hackers depends. Hacking brings into existence the inexhaustible multiplicity of all codes, be they natural or social, programmed or poetic. But as it is the act of hacking that composes, at one and the same time, the hacker and the hack, hacking recognises no artificial scarcity, no official licence, no credentialing police force other than that composed by the gift economy among hackers themselves.

48. A politics that embraces its existence as statement, as affirmative difference, not as negation can escape the politics of the state. To ignore or plagiarise representation, to refuse to give it what it claims as its due, is to begin a politics of statelessness. A politics which refuses the state's authority to authorise what is a valued statement and what isn't. A politics which is always temporary, always becoming something other than itself. Even useless hacks may come, perversely enough, to be valued for the purity of their uselessness. There is nothing that can't be valued as a representation. The hack always has to move on.

49. Everywhere dissatisfaction with representations is spreading. Sometimes its a matter of breaking a few shop windows, sometimes of breaking a few heads. So-called 'violence' against the state, which rarely amounts to more than throwing rocks at its police, is merely the desire for the state expressed in its masochistic form. Where some call for a state that recognises their representation, others call for a state that beats them to a pulp. Neither is a politics that escapes the desire cultivated within the subject by the educational apparatus.

50. Sometimes direct democracy is posited as the alternative. But this merely changes the moment of representation - it puts politics in the hands of claimants to an activist representation, in place of an electoral one.. Sometimes what is demanded of the politics of representation is that it recognise a new subject. Minorities of race, gender, preference demand the right to representation. But soon enough they discover the cost. They must now police the meaning of this representation, and police the adherence of its members to it. Even at its best, in its most abstract form, on its best behaviour, the colour blind, gender neutral, multicultural state just hands the value of representation over to the commodity form. While this is progress, particularly for those formerly oppressed by the state's failure to recognise their identity as legitimate, it stops short at the recognition of expressions of subjectivity that seeks to become something other than a representation that the state can recognise and the market can value.

51. But there is something else hovering on the horizon of the representable. There is a politics of the unrepresentable, a politics of the presentation of the non-negotiable demand. This is politics as the refusal of representation itself, not the politics of refusing this or that representation. A politics which, while abstract, is not utopian. In its infinite and limitless demand, it may even be the best way of extracting concessions precisely through its refusal to put a name - or a price - on what revolt desires.

Revolt

52. The revolts of 1989 are the signal events of our time. What the revolts of 1989 achieved was the overthrow of regimes so impervious to the recognition of the value of the hack that they had starved not only their hackers but also their workers and farmers of any increase in the surplus. With their cronyism and kleptocracy, their bureaucracy and ideology, their police and spies, they starved even their pastoralists and capitalists of innovative transformation and growth.

53. The revolts of 1989 overthrew boredom and necessity. At least for a time. They put back on the world historical agenda the limitless demand for free statement. At least for a time. They revealed the latent destiny of world history to express the pure virtuality of becoming. At least for a time, before new states cobbled themselves together and claimed legitimacy as representations of what revolt desired. The revolts of 1989 opened the portal to the virtual, but the states that regrouped around this opening soon closed it. What the revolts really achieved was the making of the world safe for vectoral power.

54. The so-called anti-globalisation protests of the 90s are a ripple caused by the wake of these signal events, but a ripple that did not know the current to which it truly belonged. This movement of revolt in the overdeveloped world identifies the rising vectoral power as a class enemy, but all too often it allowed itself to be captured by the partial and temporary interests of local capitalist and pastoralist classes. It was a revolt is in its infancy that has yet to discover the connection between its engine of limitless desire and free statement, and the art of making tactical demands.

55. The class struggle within nations and the imperial struggle between nations has taken shape as two forms of politics. One kind of politics is regressive. It seeks to return to an imagined past. It seeks to use national borders as a new wall, a neon screen behind which unlikely alliances might protect their existing interests in the name of a glorious past. The other form is the progressive politics of movement. The politics of movement seeks to accelerate toward an unknown future. It seeks to use international flows of information, trade or activism as the eclectic means for struggling for new sources of wealth or liberty that overcomes the limitations imposed by national coalitions.

56. Neither of these politics corresponds to the old notion of a left or right, which the revolutions of 1989 have definitively overcome. Regressive politics brings together luddite impulses from the left with racist and reactionary impulses from the right in an unholy alliance against new sources of power. Progressive politics rarely takes the form of an alliance, but constitutes two parallel processes locked in a dialogue of mutual suspicion, in which the liberalising forces of the right and the social justice and human rights forces of the left both seek non-national and transnational solutions to unblocking the system of power which still accumulates at the national level.

57. There is a third politics, which stands outside the alliances and compromises of the post-89 world. Where both progressive and regressive politics are representative politics, which deal with aggregate party alliances and interests, this third politics is a stateless politics, which seeks escape from politics as such. A politics of the hack, inventing relations outside of representation.

58. Expressive politics is a struggle against commodity property itself. Expressive politics is not the struggle to collectivise property, for that is still a form of property. Expressive politics is the struggle to free what can be free from both versions of the commodity form - its totalising market form, and its bureaucratic state form. What may be free from the commodity form altogether is not land, not capital, but information. All other forms of property are exclusive. The ownership by one excludes, by definition, the ownership by another. But information as property may be shared without diminishing anything but its scarcity. Information is that which can escape the commodity form.

59. Politics can become expressive only when it is a politics of freeing the virtuality of information. In liberating information from its objectification as a commodity, it liberates also the subjective force of statement. Subject and object meet each other outside of their mere lack of each other, by their desire merely for each other. Expressive politics does not seek to overthrow the existing society, or to reform its larger structures, or to preserve its structure so as to maintain an existing coalition of interests. It seeks to permeate existing states with a new state of existence, spreading the seeds of an alternative practice of everyday life.

1
Slow Blogging is a rejection of immediacy. It is an affirmation that not all things worth reading are written quickly, and that many thoughts are best served after being fully baked and worded in an even temperament.  

2
Slow Blogging is speaking like it matters, like the pixels that give your words form are precious and rare. It is a willingness to let current events pass without comment. It is deliberate in its pace, breaking its unhurried stride for nothing short of true emergency. And perhaps not even then, for slow is not the speed of most emergencies, and places where beloved, reassuring speed rules the day will serve us best at those times. 

3
Slow Blogging is a reversal of the disintegration into the one-liners and cutting turns of phrase that are often the early lives of our best ideas. Its a process in which flashes of thought shine and then fade to take their place in the background as part of something larger. Slow Blogging does not write thoughts onto the ethereal and eternal parchment before they provide an enduring worth in the shape of our ideas over time. 

4
Slow Blogging is a willingness to remain silent amid the daily outrages and ecstasies that fill nothing more than single moments in time, switching between banality, crushing heartbreak and end-of-the-world psychotic glee in the mere space between headlines. The thing you wished you said in the moment last week can be said next month, or next year, and you’ll only look all the smarter. 

5
Slow Blogging is a response to and a rejection of Pagerank. Pagerank, the ugly-beautiful monster that sits behind the many folded curtains of Google, deciding the question of authority and relevance to your searches. Blog early, blog often, and Google will reward you. Condition your creative self to the secret frequency, and find yourself adored by Google; you will appear where everybody looks – in the first few pages of results. Follow your own pace and find your works never found; refuse Pagerank its favours and your work is pulled as if by riptide into the deep waters of undifferentiated results. Its twisted idea of the common good has made Pagerank a terrifying enemy of the commons, setting a pace that forbids the reflection that is necessary to move past the day to day and into legacy.

6
Slow Blogging is the re-establishment of the machine as the agent of human expression, rather than its whip and container. It’s the voluntary halting of the light-speed hamster wheel dictated in rules of highly effective  blogging. It is an imposition of asynchronous temporalities, where we do not type faster to keep up with the computer, where the speed of retrieval does not necessitate the same pace of consumption, where good and bad works are created in their own time.

Weblog Ethics

Weblogs are the mavericks of the online world. Two of their greatest strengths are their ability to filter and disseminate information to a widely dispersed audience, and their position outside the mainstream of mass media. Beholden to no one, weblogs point to, comment on, and spread information according to their own, quirky criteria.

The weblog network's potential influence may be the real reason mainstream news organizations have begun investigating the phenomenon, and it probably underlies much of the talk about weblogs as journalism. Webloggers may not think in terms of control and influence, but commercial media do. Mass media seeks, above all, to gain a wide audience. Advertising revenues, the lifeblood of any professional publication or broadcast, depend on the size of that publication's audience. Content, from a business standpoint, is there only to deliver eyeballs to advertisers, whether the medium is paper or television.

Journalists — the people who actually report the news — are acutely aware of the potential for abuse that is inherent in their system, which relies on support from businesses and power brokers, each with an agenda to promote. Their ethical standards are designed to delineate the journalist's responsibilities and provide a clear code of conduct that will ensure the integrity of the news.

Weblogs, produced by nonprofessionals, have no such code, and individual webloggers seem almost proud of their amateur status. ""We don't need no stinkin' fact checkers"" seems to be the prevailing attitude, as if inaccuracy were a virtue.

“ Let me propose a radical notion: The weblog's greatest strength — its uncensored, unmediated, uncontrolled voice — is also its greatest weakness. ”

Let me propose a radical notion: The weblog's greatest strength — its uncensored, unmediated, uncontrolled voice — is also its greatest weakness. News outlets may be ultimately beholden to advertising interests, and reporters may have a strong incentive for remaining on good terms with their sources in order to remain in the loop; but because they are businesses with salaries to pay, advertisers to please, and audiences to attract and hold, professional news organizations have a vested interest in upholding certain standards so that readers keep subscribing and advertisers keep buying. Weblogs, with only minor costs and little hope of significant financial gain, have no such incentives.

The very things that may compromise professional news outlets are at the same time incentives for some level of journalistic standards. And the very things that make weblogs so valuable as alternative news sources — the lack of gatekeepers and the freedom from all consequences — may compromise their integrity and thus their value. There is every indication that weblogs will gain even greater influence as their numbers grow and awareness of the form becomes more widespread. It is not true, as some people assert, that the network will route around misinformation, or that the truth is always filtered to widespread awareness. Rumors spread because they are fun to pass along. Corrections rarely gain much traction either in the real world or online; they just aren't as much fun.

There has been almost no talk about ethics in the weblog universe: Mavericks are notoriously resistant to being told what to do. But I would propose a set of six rules that I think form a basis of ethical behavior for online publishers of all kinds.1 I hope that the weblog community will thoughtfully consider the principles outlined here; in time, and with experience, the community may see the need to add to these rules or to further codify our standards. At the very least, I hope these principles will spur discussion about our responsibilities and the ramifications of our collective behavior.

“Each of these suggestions attempts to bring transparency — one of the weblog's distinguishing characteristics and greatest strengths — into every aspect of the practice of weblogging. ”
Journalistic codes of ethics seek to ensure fairness and accuracy in news reporting. By comparison, each of these suggestions attempts to bring transparency — one of the weblog's distinguishing characteristics and greatest strengths — into every aspect of the practice of weblogging. It is unrealistic to expect every weblogger to present an even-handed picture of the world, but it is very reasonable to expect them to be forthcoming about their sources, biases, and behavior.

Webloggers who, despite my best efforts, persist in their quest to be regarded as journalists will have a special interest in adhering to these principles. News organizations may someday be willing to point to weblogs (or weblog entries) as serious sources, but only if weblogs have, as a whole, demonstrated integrity in their information gathering and dissemination, and consistency in their online conduct.
Any weblogger who expects to be accorded the privileges and protections of a professional journalist will need to go further than these principles. Rights have associated responsibilities; in the end it is an individual's professionalism and meticulous observance of recognized ethical standards that determines her status in the eyes of society and the law. For the rest of us, I believe the following standards are sufficient:

1. Publish as fact only that which you believe to be true.

If your statement is speculation, say so. If you have reason to believe that something is not true, either don't post it, or note your reservations. When you make an assertion, do so in good faith; state it as fact only if, to the best of your knowledge, it is so.

2. If material exists online, link to it when you reference it.

Linking to referenced material allows readers to judge for themselves the accuracy and insightfulness of your statements. Referencing material but selectively linking only that with which you agree is manipulative. Online readers deserve, as much as possible, access to all of the facts — the Web, used this way, empowers readers to become active, not passive, consumers of information. Further, linking to source material is the very means by which we are creating a vast, new, collective network of information and knowledge.
On the rare occasion when a writer wishes to reference but not drive traffic to a site she considers to be morally reprehensible (for example, a hate site), she should type out (but not link) the name or URL of the offending site and state the reasons for her decision. This will give motivated readers the information they need to find the site in order to make their own judgment. This strategy allows the writer to preserve her own transparency (and thus her integrity) while simultaneously declining to lend support to a cause she finds contemptible.

3. Publicly correct any misinformation.

If you find that you have linked to a story that was untrue, make a note of it and link to a more accurate report. If one of your own statements proves to be inaccurate, note your misstatement and the truth. Ideally, these corrections would appear in the most current version of your weblog and as an added note to the original entry. (Remember that search engines will pull up entries without regard to when they were posted; once an entry exists in your archives, it may continue to spread an untruth even if you corrected the information a few days later.) If you aren't willing to add a correction to previous entries, at least note it in a later post.
One clear method of denoting a correction is the one employed by Cory Doctorow, one of the contributors to the Boing Boing weblog. He strikes through any erroneous information and adds the corrected information immediately following. The reader can see at a glance what Bill Cory originally wrote and that he has updated the entry with information he feels to be more accurate. (Do it like this in HTML: The reader can see at a glance what <strike>Bill</strike> Cory originally wrote and that he has updated the entry with information he feels to be more accurate.)

4. Write each entry as if it could not be changed; add to, but do not rewrite or delete, any entry.

Post deliberately. If you invest each entry with intent, you will ensure your personal and professional integrity.
“ The network of shared knowledge we are building will never be more than a novelty unless we protect its integrity by creating permanent records of our publications. ”
Changing or deleting entries destroys the integrity of the network. The Web is designed to be connected; indeed, the weblog permalink is an invitation for others to link. Anyone who comments on or cites a document on the Web relies on that document (or entry) to remain unchanged. A prominent addendum is the preferred way to correct any information anywhere on the Web. If an addendum is impractical, as in the case of an essay that contains numerous inaccuracies, changes must be noted with the date and a brief description of the nature of the change.

If you think this is overly scrupulous, consider the case of the writer who points to an online document in support of an assertion. If this document changes or disappears — and especially if the change is not noted — her argument may be rendered nonsensical. Books do not change; journals are static. On paper, new versions are always denoted as such.
The network of shared knowledge we are building will never be more than a novelty unless we protect its integrity by creating permanent records of our publications. The network benefits when even entries that are rendered irrelevant by changing circumstance are left as a historical record. As an example: A weblogger complains about inaccuracies in an online article; the writer corrects those inaccuracies (and notes them!); the weblogger's entry is therefore meaningless — or is it? Deleting the entry somehow asserts that the whole incident simply didn't happen — but it did. The record is more accurate and history is better served if the weblogger notes beneath the original entry that the writer has made the corrections and the article is now, to the weblogger's knowledge, accurate.

History can be rewritten, but it cannot be undone. Changing or deleting words is possible on the Web, but possibility does not always make good policy. Think before you publish and stand behind what you write. If you later decide you were wrong about something, make a note of it and move on.
I make a point never to post anything I am not willing to stand behind even if I later disagree. I work to be thoughtful and accurate, no matter how angry or excited I am about a particular topic. If I change my opinion in a day or two, I just note the change. If I need to apologize for something I've said, I do so.

If you discover that you have posted erroneous information, you must note this publicly on your weblog. Deleting the offending entry will do nothing to correct the misinformation your readers have already absorbed. Taking the additional step of adding a correction to the original entry will ensure that Google broadcasts accurate information into the future.
The only exception to this rule is when you inadvertently reveal personal information about someone else. If you discover that you have violated a confidence or made an acquaintance uncomfortable by mentioning him, it is only fair to remove the offending entry altogether, but note that you have done so.

5. Disclose any conflict of interest.

Most webloggers are quite transparent about their jobs and professional interests. It is the computer programmer's expertise that gives her commentary special weight when she analyzes a magazine article about the merits of the latest operating system. Since weblog audiences are built on trust, it is to every weblogger's benefit to disclose any monetary (or other potentially conflicting) interests when appropriate. An entrepreneur may have special insight into the effect of a proposed Senate bill or a business merger; if she stands to benefit directly from the outcome of any event, she should note that in her comments. A weblogger, impressed with a service or product, should note that she holds stock in the company every time she promotes the service on her page. Even the weblogger who receives a CD for review should note that fact; her readers can decide for themselves whether her favorable review is based on her taste or on her desire to continue to receive free CDs.

Quickly note any potential conflict of interest and then say your piece; your readers will have all the information they need to assess your commentary.

6. Note questionable and biased sources.

When a serious article comes from a highly biased or questionable source, the weblogger has a responsibility to clearly note the nature of the site on which it was found. In their foraging, webloggers occasionally find interesting, well-written articles on sites that are maintained by highly biased organizations or by seemingly fanatical individuals. Readers need to know whether an article on the medical ramifications of first trimester abortion comes from a site that is pro-life, pro-choice, or strongly opposed to medical intervention of all kinds. A thoughtful summation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may be worth reading whether it is written by a member of the PLO or a Zionist — but readers have the right to be alerted to the source.

It is reasonable to expect that expert foragers have the knowledge and motivation to assess the nature of these sources; it is not reasonable to assume that all readers do. Readers depend on weblogs, to some extent, for guidance in navigating the Web. To present an article from a source that is a little nutty or has a strong agenda is fine; not to acknowledge the nature of that source is unethical, since readers don't have the information they need to fully evaluate the article's merits.

If you are afraid that your readers will discount the article entirely based on its context, consider why you are linking it at all. If you strongly feel the piece has merit, say why and let it stand on its own, but be clear about its source. Your readers may cease to trust you if they discover even once that you disguised — or didn't make clear — the source of an article they might have evaluated differently had they been given all the facts.

1 With regard to points 1 and 5, I am indebted to Dave Winer for his discussions on Scripting News about integrity with regard to weblogging. Though our thinking diverges greatly, his ideas were one springboard for my own thoughts on the matter.

Let the top of hierarchy know that they can't use technology to control
us, but that we are fully integrated with technology and it is ours.
Digitize the world!!! 
It's time to interface with technology and understand it.

Get TECH. out of the establishment and into the streets.
Dive in CYBERSPACE where all feelings and physical realities can be
psycho-chemically simulated. 
DON'T BE AFRAID : EXPOSE YOUR CIRCUITRY. 
COME TO TERMS WITH TODAY'S MATERIALS.
The future will come whether you like it or not so be ready for it.

By Christian As. Kirtchev



We are the ELECTRONIC MINDS, a group of free-minded rebels. Cyberpunks.
We live in Cyberspace, we are everywhere, we know no boundaries.
This is our manifest. The Cyberpunks' manifest.


I. Cyberpunk

1/ We are those, the Different. Technological rats, swimming in the ocean of information.
2/ We are the retiring, little kid at school, sitting at the last desk, in the corner of the class room. 3/ We are the teenager everybody considers strange 4/ We are the student hacking computer systems, exploring the depth of his reach. 5/ We are the grown-up in the park, sitting on a bench, laptop on his knees, programming the last virtual reality. 6/ Ours is the garage, stuffed with electronics. The soldering iron in the corner of the desk and the nearby disassembled radio- they are also ours. Ours is the cellar with computers, buzzing printers and beeping modems. 7/ We are those that see reality in a different way. Our point of view shows more than ordinary people can see. They see only what is outside, but we see what is inside. That's what we are - realists with the glasses of dreamers. 8/ We are those strange people, almost unknown to the neighborhood. People, indulged in their own thoughts, sitting day after day before the computer, ransacking the net for something. We are not often out of home, just from time to time, only to go to the nearby radio shack, or to the usual bar to meet some of the few friends we have, or to meet a client, or to the backstreet druggist... or just for a little walk. 9/ We do not have many friends, only a few with whom we go to parties. Everybody else we know we know on the net. Our real friends are there, on the other side of the line. We know them from our favorite IRC channel, from the News-Groups, from the systems we hang-around: 10/ We are those who don't give a shit about what people think about us, we don't care what we look like or what people talk about us in our absence. 11/ The majority of us likes to live in hiding, being unknown to everybody except those few we must inevitably contact with. 12/ Others love publicity, they love fame. They are all known in the underground world. Their names are often heard there.
But we are all united by one thing - we are Cyberpunks.

13/ Society does not understand us, we are ""weird"" and ""crazy"" people in the eyes of the ordinary people who live far from information and free ideas. Society denies our way of thinking - a society, living, thinking and breathing in one and only one way - a clichc. 14/ They deny us for we think like free people, and free thinking is forbidden. 15/ The Cyberpunk has outer appearance, he is no motion. Cyberpunks are people, starting from the ordinary and known to nobody person, to the artist-technomaniac, to the musician, playing electronic music, to the superficial scholar. 16/ The Cyberpunk is no literature genre anymore, not even an ordinary subculture. The Cyberpunk is a stand-alone new culture, offspring of the new age. A culture that unites our common interests and views. We are a unit. We are Cyberpunks.


II. Society

1/ The Society which surrounds us is clogged with concervacy pulling everything and everybody to itself, while it sinks slowly in the quicksands of time. 2/ However doggedly some refuse to believe it, it is obvious that we live in a sick society. The so called reforms which our governments so adeptly use to boast, are nothing else but a little step forward, when a whole jump can be done. 3/ People fear the new and unknown. They prefer the old, the known and checked truths. They are afraid of what the new can bring to them. They are afraid that they can lose what they have. 4/ Their fear is so strong that it has proclaimed the revolutional a foe and a the free idea - its weapon. That's their fault. 5/ People must leave this fear behind and go ahead. What's the sense to stick to the little you have now when you can have more tomorrow. Everything they must do is stretch their hands and feel for the new; give freedom to thoughts, ideas, to words: 6/ For centuries each generation has been brought up is a same pattern. Ideals is what everybody follows. Individuality is forgotten. People think in a same way, following the clichc drilled in them in childhood, the clichc-education for all children: And, when someone dares defy authority, he is punished and given as a bad example. ""Here is what happens to you when you express your own opinion and deny your teacher's one"". 7/ Our society is sick and need to be healed. The cure is a change in the system...


III. The System

1/ The System. Centuries-old, existing on principles that hang no more today. A System that has not changed much since the day of its birth. 2/ The System is wrong. 3/ The System must impose its truth upon us so that it can rule. The government needs us follow it blindly. For this reason we live in an informational eclipse. When people acquire information other that that from the government, they cannot distinguish the right from the wrong. So the lie becomes a truth - a truth, fundamental to everything else. Thus the leaders control with lies and the ordinary people have no notion of what is true and follow the government blindly, trusting it. 4/ We fight for freedom of information. We fight for freedom of speech and press. For the freedom to express our thoughts freely, without being persecuted by the system. 5/ Even in the most-developed and 'democratic' countries, the system imposes misinformation. Even in the countries that pretend to be the cradle of free speech. Misinformation is one of the system's main weapon. A weapon, they use very well. 6/ It is the Net that helps us spread the information freely. The Net, with no boundaries and information limit 7/ Ours is yours, yours is ours. 8/ Everyone can share information, no restrictions. 9/ Encrypting of informattion is our weapon. Thus the words of revolution can spread uninterrupted, and the government can only guess. 10/ The Net is our realm, in the Net we are Kings.11/ Laws. The world is changing, but the laws remain the same. The System is not changing, only a few details get redressed for the new time, but everything in the concept remains the same. 12/ We need new laws. Laws, fitting the times we live in, with the world that surrounds us. Not laws build on the basis of the past. Laws, build for today, laws, that will fit tomorrow. 13/ The laws that only refrain us. Laws that badly need revision.


IV. The vision

1/ Some people do not care much about what happens globally. They care about what happens around them, in their micro-universe. 2/ These people can only see a dark future, for they can only see the life they live now. 3/ Others show some concern about the global affairs. They are interested in everything,in the future in perspective, in what is going to happen globally. 4/ They have a more optimistic view. To them the future is cleaner and more beautiful, for they can see into it and they see a more mature man, a wiser world. 5/ We are in the middle. We are interested in what happens now, but what in what's gonna happen tomorow as well. 6/ We look in the net, and the net is growing wide and wider. 7/ Soon everything in this world will be swallowed by the net: from the military systems to the PC at home. 8/ But the net is a house of anarchy. 9/ It cannot be controlled and in this is its power. 10/ Every man will be dependent on the net. 11/ The whole information will be there, locked in the abysses of zeros and ones. 12/ Who controls the net, controls the information. 13/ We will live in a mixture of past and present. 14/ The bad come from the man, and the good comes from technology. 15/ The net will control the little man, and we will control the net. 16/ For is you do not control, you will be controlled. 17/ The Information is POWER!


V. Where are we?

1/ Where are we? 2/ We all live in a sick world, where hatred is a weapon, and freedom - a dream. 3/ The world grows so slowly. It is hard for a Cyberpunk to live in an underdeveloped world, looking the people around him, seeing how wrongly they develop. 4/ We go ahead, they pull us back again. Society suppressses us. Yes, it suppresses the freedom of thought. With its cruel education programs in schools and universities. They drill in the children their view of things and every attempt to express a different opinion is denied and punished. 5/ Our kids grow educated in this old and still unchanged system. A system that tolerates no freedom of thought and demands a strict obeyance to the reules... 6/ In what a worlds, how different from this, could we live now, if people were making jumps and not creeps. 7/ It is so hard to live in this world, Cyberpunk. 8/ It is as if time has stopped. 9/ We live on the right spot, but not in the right time. 10/ Everything is so ordinary, people are all the same, their deeds toos. As if society feels an urgent need to live back in time. 11/ Some, trying to find their own world, the world of a Cyberpunk, and finding it, build their own world. Build in their thoughts, it changes reality, lays over it and thus they live in a virtual world. The thought-up, build upon reality: 12/ Others simply get accustomed to the world as it is. They continue to live in it, although they dislike it. They have no other choice but the bare hope that the world will go out of its hollow and will go ahead.13/ What we are trying to do is change the situation. We are trying to adjust the present world to our needs and views. To use maximally what is fit and to ignore the trash. Where we can't, we just live in this world, like Cyberpunks, no matter how hard, when society fights us we fight back.14/ We build our worlds in Cyberspace. 15/ Among the zeros and ones, among the bits of information. 16/ We build our community. The community of Cyberpunks.


Unite!
Fight for your rights!


We are the ELECTRONIC MINDS, a group of free-minded rebels. Cyberpunks.
We live in Cyberspace, we are everywhere, we know no boundaries.
This is our manifest. The Cyberpunks' Manifest.

by Eric Hughes


Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.

If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has a memory of their interaction. Each party can speak about their own memory of this; how could anyone prevent it? One could pass laws against it, but the freedom of speech, even more than privacy, is fundamental to an open society; we seek not to restrict any speech at all. If many parties speak together in the same forum, each can speak to all the others and aggregate together knowledge about individuals and other parties. The power of electronic communications has enabled such group speech, and it will not go away merely because we might want it to.

Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary for that transaction. Since any information can be spoken of, we must ensure that we reveal as little as possible. In most cases personal identity is not salient. When I purchase a magazine at a store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no need to know who I am. When I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive messages, my provider need not know to whom I am speaking or what I am saying or what others are saying to me; my provider only need know how to get the message there and how much I owe them in fees. When my identity is revealed by the underlying mechanism of the transaction, I have no privacy. I cannot here selectively reveal myself; I must always reveal myself.

Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system. An anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system. An anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.

Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography. If I say something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it. If the content of my speech is available to the world, I have no privacy. To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy, and to encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for privacy. Furthermore, to reveal one's identity with assurance when the default is anonymity requires the cryptographic signature.

We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence. It is to their advantage to speak of us, and we should expect that they will speak. To try to prevent their speech is to fight against the realities of information. Information does not just want to be free, it longs to be free. Information expands to fill the available storage space. Information is Rumor's younger, stronger cousin; Information is fleeter of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and understands less than Rumor.

We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. We must come together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions to take place. People have been defending their own privacy for centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret handshakes, and couriers. The technologies of the past did not allow for strong privacy, but electronic technologies do.

We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems. We are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money.

Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all to use, worldwide. We don't much care if you don't approve of the software we write. We know that software can't be destroyed and that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down.

Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is fundamentally a private act. The act of encryption, in fact, removes information from the public realm. Even laws against cryptography reach only so far as a nation's border and the arm of its violence. Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and with it the anonymous transactions systems that it makes possible.

For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract. People must come and together deploy these systems for the common good. Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's fellows in society. We the Cypherpunks seek your questions and your concerns and hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive ourselves. We will not, however, be moved out of our course because some may disagree with our goals.

The Cypherpunks are actively engaged in making the networks safer for privacy. Let us proceed together apace.

Onward.

1
[The content of the manifesto represents the view of the authors and does not claim to represent the views of UCLA, the UCLA Humanities, Division, and the Digital Humanities at UCLA.]


2
Digital humanities is not a unified field but an array of convergent practices that explore a universe in which print is no longer the exclusive or the normative medium in which knowledge is produced and/or disseminated.


3
Like all media revolutions, the first wave of the digital revolution looked backwards as it moved forward. It replicated a world where print was primary and visuality was secondary, while vastly accelerating search and retrieval. Now it must look forwards into an immediate future in which the medium specific features of the digital become its core.


4
The first wave was quantitative, mobilizing the vertiginous search and retrieval powers of the database. The second wave is qualitative, interpretive, experiential, even emotive. It immerses the digital toolkit within what represents the very core strength of the Humanities: complexity.


5
Interdisciplinarity/transdisciplinarity/multidisciplinarity are empty words unless they imply changes in language, practice, method, and output.


6
The digital is the realm of the open: open source, open resources, open doors. Anything that attempts to close this space should be recognized for what it is: the enemy.


7
Yes, there is something utopian at the core of digital humanities: The open, the unfixed, the contingent, the infinite, the expansive, the no place.


8
Copyright and IP standards must, accordingly, be freed from the stranglehold of Capital. Pirate and pervert Disney materials on such a massive scale that Disney will have to sue… your entire neighborhood, school, or country. Practice digital anarchy by creatively undermining copyright and mashing up media.


9
The multi-purposing and multiple channeling of humanistic knowledge: no channel excludes the other. This is an abundance based economy, not one based upon scarcity. It values the COPY more highly than ORIGINALS and restores to the word COPY its original meaning of abundance: COPIA = COPIOUSNESS = THE OVERFLOWING BOUNTY OF THE INFORMATION AGE.


10
Large-scale complexity: need for teamwork as new model for the production and reproduction of humanistic knowledge. Teams sometimes fail because they take risks. This is the heart of digital humanities: Risk-taking, collaboration, and experimentation.


11
Co-creation is one of the founding features of the digital turn in the human sciences, because of the greater complexity. But this collaborative turn doesn’t exclude … perhaps there is a space of hermetic works of the mad individual.


12
Among the highest aims of scholarship: entertainment; entertainment as scholarship: a scandal that is now no longer a scandal. To speak to an audience.


13
Process is the new god; not product. Anything that stands in the way of the perpetual mash-up and remix stands in the way of the digital revolution.


14
Dedefinition of the contours of the research community once enclosed by university walls. The field of knowledge and expertise far exceeds these confines. There is no containing it within these walls. The challenge: to construct models of knowledge creation/sharing that confront this increasingly distributed reality.


15
Wiki-nomics is the new social, cultural, and economic reality. Technologies and content are mass produced, mass authored, and mass administered. Social media produce culture.


16
Big Humanities: whereas the revolution of the post-WWII era has consisted in the proliferation of every smaller and more rigorous areas of expertise and subexpertise, and the consequent emergence of private languages, the Digital humanities revolution is about integration: the building of bigger pictures out of the tesserae of expert knowledge. It is not about the emergence of a new general culture, Renaissance humanism/humanities, or universal literacy, but, on the contrary, promotes collaboration across domains of expertise.


17
At the edges of digital humanities, entertainment meets the highest standards of scholarship in ways that forge a new trans-university audience for humanistic knowledge.


18
Beware of the false fellow travelers: they will wave the banners of change with continuity on their agenda.


19
Beware of the great diminishers: they will reduce anything in digital humanities and preface our work with ""just"" (it's just a tool; it's just an archive; it's just pedagogy). They have never built software, parsed code, created a database, or designed a user interface. They just write articles and books.


20
Digital humanities promote a flattening of the relationship between masters and disciples. A dedefinition of the roles of professor and student, expert and non-expert.

21
Digital humanities represents the woven together practice of research: a triangulation of arts practice, commentary/critique, and outreach, merging scholarly inquiry, pedagogy, publication and practice.


22
REMARKS ON THE FINITUDE OF DISCIPLINES


23
Many humanities disciplines were founded on and through the medium of print (the study of literature, history; translation); the rest valorize the printed word for the generation and dissemination of knowledge of their field. What does it mean to study ""literature"" or ""history"" when print is no longer the normative medium in which literary or historical artifacts are produced, let alone analyzed? What does it mean, more generally, for humanistic knowledge?


24
Digital Humanities is the last blow. In the 70s and 80s, women's studies, LGBTQ studies, ethnic studies, and cultural studies opened up the humanities to address issues of social, political, and cultural disenfranchisement and possibilities for re-enfranchisement. The Humanities was no longer the domain of the proverbial ""old white man."" Now, digital humanities deconstructs the very materiality, methods, and media of humanistic inquiry and practices. But we must continue to ask: Where did humanities disciplines come from, in response to what kind of needs, with what sort of explanatory power? How did its practices, truth-making strategies, knowledge products, media forms, and ways of evaluating utterances get naturalized??


25
The Humanities are contingent formations that have become stabilized and made culturally redundant at the university: As if we have always had The Department of X, which has produced knowledge about X, and therefore we can’t possibly imagine anything otherwise. Let X = literature departments (German, English, Spanish, Slavic, etc), Art History, Musicology, History, Philosophy, Classics, etc. Traditional Humanities is balkanized by nation, language, method, and media. Digital Humanities is about convergence: Not only between humanities disciplines and media forms, but also between the arts, sciences, and technologies.


26
How about a thought exercise in which we imagine different constellations (not just disciplinary constellations, but also other configurations of producing knowledge that can be team- and project-based, collaborative, open-ended, globally-oriented, engaging for new audiences and institutions).


27
Here are some new departments for the Humanities Division:


28
Department of Print Media Studies: Replacing literature departments, the purpose of this department is to study the materiality of texts, constructions of authorship, linguistic forms, the history of the book and book publication, antecedents to and descendents of print, as well as the relationships and tensions between print culture and digital culture.
Department of Discourse Analyses: The purpose of this department is to study the history of the triangulation of knowledge/discourse/power, paying particular attention to discursive structures, knowledge making, and the specific media forms in which knowledge is produced, disseminated, encountered, and valued.
Department of Comparative Media Studies: The purpose of this department is to study sonic, visual, tactile, and immersive media through a comparative framework. This department replaces the division of humanities departments by media form (departments of art history, musicology, film, etc).
Department of Digital Cultural Mapping: The purpose of this department is to examine the junctions between space/time, information, and culture. It brings geographic analyses together with historical methods, visual analysis, and the presentation of knowledge. It also examines the cultural and social impact of digital mapping technologies and the significance of these mapping technologies for understanding cultural phenomena.
Department of Cultural Analytics: The purpose of this department is to bring quantitative analyses from the math and sciences together with large-scale, complex social and cultural datasets.
We encourage you to come up with your own departments!


29
We must ask: Why do disciplines/departments in the humanities (vs. the sciences) not die? Why do we try to resuscitate and sustain disciplines? Here are some reasons (there are more): Cognitive Conservatism, Institutional Inertia, the fear of risk-taking, the tenure and promotion system which encourages repetition of truthful utterances within a discipline rather than innovation and risk taking, the dogged determination to ""replace"" faculty with the same...

30
Can we imagine more flexible, nimble, contingent disciplinary formations, in which faculty and students work on ""knowledge problematics"" not in rigid disciplines and departments, in which knowledge is produced and disseminated in ways that are multivalent, truly interdisciplinary, and conspicuously cognizant of their contingency?

Context

We, professionals or observers of the digital humanities (humanités numériques) came together in Paris for THATCamp on May 18th and 19th, 2010.

Over the course of these two days, we discussed, exchanged, and collectively reflected upon what the digital humanities are, and tried to imagine and invent what they could become.

At the close of the camp – which represents but a first step – we propose to the research communities, and to all those involved in the creation, publication, valorization or preservation of knowledge, a manifesto for the digital humanities.

I. Definition

1. Society’s digital turn changes and calls into question the conditions of knowledge production and distribution.

2. For us, the digital humanities concern the totality of the social sciences and humanities. The digital humanities are not tabula rasa. On the contrary, they rely on all the paradigms, savoir-faire and knowledge specific to these disciplines, while mobilizing the tools and unique perspectives enabled by digital technology.

3. The digital humanities designate a “transdiscipline”, embodying all the methods, systems and heuristic perspectives linked to the digital within the fields of humanities and the social sciences.

II. Situation

4. We observe:

- that experiments in the digital domain of the social sciences and humanities have multiplied in the last half century. What have emerged most recently are centers for digital humanities – which at the moment are themselves only protoypes or areas of application specific to the approach of digital humanities;

- that computational and digital approaches have greater technical, and therefore economic, research constraints; that these constraints provide an opportunity to foster collaborative work;

- that while a certain number of proven methods exist, they are not equally known or shared;

- that there are many communities deriving from shared interests in practices, tools, and various interdisciplinary goals – encoding textual sources, geographic information systems, lexicometry, digitization of cultural, scientific and technical heritage, web cartography, datamining, 3D, oral archives, digital arts and hypermedia literatures, etc. – and that these communities are converging to form the field of digital humanities.

III. Declaration

5. We, professionals of the digital humanities, are building a community of practice that is solidary, open, welcoming and freely accessible.

6. We are a community without borders. We are a multilingual and multidisciplinary community.

7. Our objectives are the advancement of knowledge, the improvement of research quality in our disciplines, the enrichment of knowledge and of collective patrimony, in the academic sphere and beyond it.

8. We call for the integration of digital culture in the definition of the general culture of the twenty-first century.

IV. Guidelines

9. We call for open access to data and metadata, which must be documented and interoperable, both technically and conceptually.

10. We support the dissemination, exchange and free modification of methods, code, formats and research findings.

11. We call for the integration of digital humanities education within social science and humanities curricula. We also wish to see the creation of diplomas specific to the digital humanities, and the development of dedicated professional education. Finally, we want such expertise to be considered in recruitment and career development.

12. We commit to building a collective expertise based upon a common vocabulary, a collective expertise proceeding from the work of all the actors involved. This collective expertise is to become a common good. It is a scientific opportunity, but also an opportunity for professional insertion in all sectors.

13. We want to help define and propagate best practices, corresponding to needs identified within or across disciplines, which should derive and evolve from debate and consensus within the communities concerned. The fundamental openness of the digital humanities nevertheless assures a pragmatic approach to protocols and visions, which maintains the right to coexistence of different and competing methods, to the benefit of both thought and practice.

14. We call for the creation of scalable digital infrastructures responding to real needs. These digital infrastructures will be built iteratively, based upon methods and approaches that prove successful in research communities.

Digital Spectrology is that dirty work of a cultural theorist who wants to understand how power works in the age of circuitry. Power circulates not only in human spaces of cities, organic bodies or just plain things and objects. Increasingly, our archaeologies of the contemporary need to turn inside the machine, in order to illuminate what is the condition of existence of how we think, see, hear, remember and hallucinate in the age of software. This includes things discarded, abandoned, obsolete as much as the obscure object of desire still worthy of daylight. As such, digital archaeology deals with spectres too; but these ghosts are not only hallucinations of afterlife reached through the media of mediums, or telegraphics, signals from Mars, the screen as a window to the otherwordly; but in the electromagnetic sphere, dynamics of software, ubiquitous computing, clouds so transparent we are mistaken to think of them as soft. Media Archaeology shares a temporality of the dead and zombies with Hauntology. Dead media is never actually dead. So what is the method of a media archaeologist of technological ghosts? She opens up the hood, looks inside, figures out what are the processual technics of our politics and aesthetics: The Aesthetico-Technical.

bruces@well.com

Ever notice how many books there are about the Internet these days? About 13,493 so far, right? And how about ""multimedia?"" There are 8,784 books on this topic, even though no one has ever successfully defined the term. CD-ROM -- is there a single marketable topic left that hasn't been shovelwared into the vast digital mire that is CD-ROM? And how about the ""Information Superhighway"" and ""Virtual Reality""? Every magazine on the planet has done awestruck vaporware cover stories on these two consensus-hallucinations.

Our culture is experiencing a profound radiation of new species of media. The centralized, dinosaurian one- to-many media that roared and trampled through the 20th century are poorly adapted to the postmodern technological environment. The new media environment is aswarm with lumbering toothy digital mammals. It's all lynxes here, and gophers there, plus big fat venomous webcrawlers, appearing in Pleistocene profusion.

This is all well and good, and it's lovely that so many people are paying attention to this. Nothing gives me greater pleasure as a professional garage futurist than to ponder some weird new mutant medium and wonder how this squawking little monster is going to wriggle its way into the interstices between human beings. Still, there's a difference between this pleasurable contemplation of the technological sublime and an actual coherent understanding of the life and death of media. We have no idea in hell what we are doing to ourselves with these new media technologies, and no consistent way even to discuss the subject. Something constructive ought to be done about this situation.

I can't do much about it, personally, because I'm booked up to the eyeballs until the end of the millennium. So is my good friend Richard Kadrey, author of the COVERT CULTURE SOURCEBOOK. Both Kadrey and myself, however, recently came to a joint understanding that what we'd really like to see at this cultural conjunction is an entirely new kind of book on media. A media book of the dead.

Plenty of wild wired promises are already being made for all the infant media. What we need is a somber, thoughtful, thorough, hype-free, even lugubrious book that honors the dead and resuscitates the spiritual ancestors of today's mediated frenzy. A book to give its readership a deeper, paleontological perspective right in the dizzy midst of the digital revolution. We need a book about the failures of media, the collapses of media, the supercessions of media, the strangulations of media, a book detailing all the freakish and hideous media mistakes that we should know enough now not to repeat, a book about media that have died on the barbed wire of technological advance, media that didn't make it, martyred media, dead media. THE HANDBOOK OF DEAD MEDIA. A naturalist's field guide for the communications paleontologist.

Neither Richard Kadrey nor myself are currently in any position to write this proposed handbook. However, we both feel that our culture truly requires this book: this rich, witty, insightful, profusely illustrated, perfectbound, acid-free-paper coffee-table book, which is to be brought out, theoretically, eventually, by some really with-it, cutting-edge early-21st century publisher. The kind of book that will appear in seventeen different sections of your local chainstore: Political Affairs, Postmodern Theory, Computer Science, Popular Mechanics, Design Studies, the coffeetable artbook section, the remainder table -- you know, whatever.

It's a rather rare phenomenon for an established medium to die. If media make it past their Golden Vaporware stage, they usually expand wildly in their early days and then shrink back to some protective niche as they are challenged by later and more highly evolved competitors. Radio didn't kill newspapers, TV didn't kill radio or movies, video and cable didn't kill broadcast network TV; they just all jostled around seeking a more perfect app.

But some media do, in fact, perish. Such as: the phenakistoscope. The teleharmonium. The Edison wax cylinder. The stereopticon. The Panorama. Early 20th century electric searchlight spectacles. Morton Heilig's early virtual reality. Telefon Hirmondo. The various species of magic lantern. The pneumatic transfer tubes that once riddled the underground of Chicago. Was the Antikythera Device a medium? How about the Big Character Poster Democracy Wall in Peking in the early 80s?

Never heard of any of these? Well, that's the problem. Both Kadrey and I happen to be vague aficionados of this field of study, and yet we both suspect that there must be hundreds of dead media, known to few if any. It would take the combined and formidable scholarly talents of, say, Carolyn ""When Old Technologies Were New"" Marvin and Ricky ""Learned Pigs and Fireproof Women"" Jay to do this ambitious project genuine justice. Though we haven't asked, we kinda suspect that these two distinguished scholars are even busier than me and Kadrey, who, after all, are just science fiction writers who spend most of our time watching Chinese videos, reading fanzines and making up weird crap.

However. We do have one, possibly crucial, advantage. We have Internet access. If we can somehow convince the current digital media community-at-large that DEAD MEDIA is a worthwhile project, we believe that we may be able to compile a useful public-access net archive on this subject. We plan to begin with the DEAD MEDIA World Wide Web Page, on a site to-be-announced. Move on, perhaps, to alt.dead.media. Compile the Dead Media FAQ. We hope to exploit the considerable strengths of today's cutting-edge media to create a general public- domain homage to the media pioneers of the past.

Here's the deal. Kadrey and I are going to start pooling our notes. We're gonna make those notes freely available to anybody on the Net. If we can get enough net.parties to express interest and pitch in reports, stories, and documentation about dead media, we're willing to take on the hideous burdens of editing and system administration -- no small deal when it comes to this supposedly ""free"" information.

We both know that authors are supposed to jealously guard really swell ideas like this, but we strongly feel that that just ain't the way to do a project of this sort. A project of this sort is a spiritual quest and an act in the general community interest. Our net heritage belongs to all netkind. If you yourself want to exploit these notes to write the DEAD MEDIA HANDBOOK -- sure, it's our ""idea,"" our ""intellectual property,"" but hey, we're cyberpunks, we write for magazines like BOING BOING, we can't be bothered with that crap in this situation. Write the book. Use our notes and everybody's else's. We won't sue you, we promise. Do it. Knock yourself out.

I'll go farther, ladies and gentlemen. To prove the profound commercial potential of this tilt at the windmill, I'll personally offer a CRISP FIFTY-DOLLAR BILL for the first guy, gal, or combination thereof to write and publish THE DEAD MEDIA HANDBOOK. You can even have the title if you want it. Just keep in mind that me and Kadrey (or any combination thereof) reserve the right to do a book of our own on the same topic if you fail to sufficiently scratch our itch. The prospect of ""competition"" frightens us not at all. It never has, frankly. If there's room for 19,785 ""Guide to the Internet"" books, there has got to be room for a few useful tomes on dead media.

Think of it this way. How long will it be before the much-touted World Wide Web interface is itself a dead medium? And what will become of all those billions of thoughts, words, images and expressions poured onto the Internet? Won't they vanish just like the vile lacquered smoke from a burning pile of junked Victrolas? As a net.person, doesn't this stark realization fill you with a certain deep misgiving, a peculiarly postmodern remorse, an almost Heian Japanese sense of the pathos of lost things? If it doesn't, why doesn't it? It ought to.

Speaking of dead media and mono no aware -- what about those little poems that Lady Murasaki used to write and stick inside cleft sticks? To be carried by foot- messager to the bamboo-shrouded estate of some lucky admirer after a night's erotic tryst? That was a medium. That medium was very alive once, a mainstay of one of the most artistically advanced cultures on earth. And isn't it dead? What are we doing today that is the functional equivalent of the cleft sticks of Murasaki Shikibu, the world's first novelist? If we ignore her historical experience, how will we learn from our own?

Listen to the following, all you digital hipsters. This is Jaqueline Goddard speaking in January 1995. Jacqueline was born in 1911, and she was one of the 20th century's great icons of bohemian femininity. Man Ray photographed her in Paris in 1930, and if we can manage it without being sued by the Juliet Man Ray Trust, we're gonna put brother Man Ray's knock-you-down-and-stomp-you- gorgeous image of Jacqueline up on our vaporware Website someday. She may be the patron saint of this effort.

Jacqueline testifies: ""After a day of work, the artists wanted to get away from their studios, and get away from what they were creating. They all met in the cafes to argue about this and that, to discuss their work, politics and philosophy.... We went to the bar of La Coupole. Bob, the barman, was a terrible nice chap... As there was no telephone in those days everybody used him to leave messages. At the Dome we also had a little place behind the door for messages. The telephone was the death of Montparnasse.""

""The telephone was the death of Montparnasse."" Mull that Surrealist testimony over a little while, all you cafe-society modemites. Jacqueline may not grok TCP/IP, but she has been there and done that. I haven't stopped thinking about that remark since I first read it. For whom does the telephone bell toll? It tolls for me and thee -- sooner or later.

Can you help us? We wish you would, and think you ought to.

We don't have choice. This decision is already made, or determined by the contemporary technological condition.

§1. Archive

We are archivists, since we have to be. We don't have choice. This decision is already made, or determined by the contemporary technological condition. The ubiquity of information in digital, calculable forms has created a new situation of work and exploitation, we entered an endless process of data production, and then we also enter an endless black hole of data navigation. The internet of data is a huge archive of data and at the same time a enormous black hole that sucks all productivities. Google is the best exemplification of this double: on the one hand, we are contributing data by using the Google tools, emails, blogs, Google+, Hangout, etc; on the other hand, Google gives us searching and managing tools to survive in this milieu. Worse still, Facebook shows another face, a huge archive of data without navigability, the only navigation one can do is to search for your friend, otherwise you need to stroll down the page to find out what you have written years ago.

Under such situation, we must recognize that one of the main economical and political questions concerning the digital is the one of archives. What has happened to the concept of archive after the digital turn? What kind of power structure is present to us in this new setting? Archives for Foucault are traces of enunciations by which one can reconstruct the game of rules (le jeu des régles), that in turn reveal the power structure of its milieu. Archives in this sense are reservoirs of discourses that make possible an archeology of knowledge. In order word, archives are sources of deduction for archeologists. The will of archive further makes archives as a manifestation of power. This will expands in the modern time and set up a direct relation between institutes and archives. Each institution has its archive, has its history of discourses. In order to maintain its status quo of discourses, it needs to give its archive a proper name. As Foucault observes the expansion of museums and libraries in modern time, that attempts “to enclose in one place all times, all epochs, all forms, all tastes”1. An archive is also a symbol of authenticity and authority. This project of the moderns confronts the biggest challenge in the digital age. On the one hand, public institutions adopting digital strategies also have to develop new form of interaction between archive and audiences, so to speak they are forced to open their archives; on the other hand, within an institutional framework, they continue keeping their archive in a centralized way (even the Michel Foucault Archive) in order to consolidate the status of these institution. Though today when these institutions implement “open polices” or alas crowdsourcing, it is still a strategy of crowd sourcing under the name of humanities or digital humanities to serve its central archives.

In this respect, Google is technically moving far ahead of these organisations, Google book, Goolge Museums are efforts to re-appropriate humanities through digitisation and crowd sourcing. Google doesn't only provide services with higher qualities and higher speed, but also goes beyond the relation between archives and human subjects. Google's archives exhibit an important distinction from that of Foucault's. It is that power is posing its forces directly on archives to achieve control, that is to say archives become a mechanism of control and social actions, instead of being traces of power2. Now we have to face a new game of rules that operates on more and more automatic and algorithmic level. Metadata produced by users become materials of induction, to generate patterns for prediction, rules, protocols of control. Archive stretches from discourses to gestures. It seems to me very clear, today in order to response to this political and economical dimensions of the web, we have to politicize the question of archive. The key seems to be personal archives. It is not simply from a technical consideration that we can then mitigate controls from the service providers or to keep privacy, but rather to rethink our relation with archives and to create another technological/digital culture. In order to do so, I propose to reflect on the following questions: What are we archiving and for what are we archiving? what does it mean to be an archivist?

§2. Care

We have been archivists from the moment we start owning things, toys, books, postcards, letters, we have our own way of organizing them, cataloging them. But it is only by now that we are confronting a situation, that we are not able to archive them, either possessing them or indexing them by ourselves. There are different levels of inabilities here: web services becomes more and more distributed, while data portability is still a problem; cloud computing is moving things from your hard-disk to someone else's server; indexation tools and personal libraries softwares are still underdeveloped, etc. These are not teddy bears, barbies, but digital objects (teddy bear and barbie dolls can be also digital). It is exactly this inability of archiving, created by the technological condition, opens up a new battlefield for search engines, social networks, cloud computing etc. But what are these objects and why do we have to re-conceptualize them seriously? In order to grasp the particular question of digital objects, we need to look at the particular evolution of the web, especially the decisive movement from Ted Nelson's vision of the web and Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web.

Ted Nelson's vision of the web was very much inspired by literature, it concerns indexation, by which one can jump from one link to another. For Nelson, the ultimate goal of the web was to create a micropayment system for authors. The invention of the web by Tim Berners-Lee and the recent use of ontologies to formalize data in machine-readable format, is not longer one that concerns hyper-link economy, but according to me a new economy of objects. It would be too complicated to argue the meaning of semantic of Semantic Web proposed by Berners-Lee, but it is clear that formalisation gives objects not only identity but also mobilities. It is only in such vision of Tim Berners-Lee we saw the continuation of the care of librarians, the emergence of a new type of object-hood defined by structuring metadata and a new type of care to come (HTML → XML → Web Ontologies). One of the examples that best demonstrate this is the enormous impact brought by human-machine readable web ontologies to library science. XML based Dublin Core directly confronted the conventional practice of MARC (MAchine-Readable Cataloging)3. “MARC must die” this was the slogan resonated among library technicians since early 2000s, you can find a specific website created by digital librarians dedicated to it. It is clear that the early development of metadata scheme for cataloging such as MARC hadn't taken the relationship between librarians and digital objects seriously. Technicians have to deal with abstract symbols which only machines can read, they are condemned to be assistants to machines

It is also within this conceptualisation of object, we can go back to the question of care that centres in the relationship between librarians and books. I take the word care very much from Martin Heidegger's Sorge. Care is the temporal structure by which we can understand our existence, this theme lies at the heart of Heidegger's Sein und Zeit. Care is not only, as we say in our daily life “taking care of something”, but also a temporal structure that create a consistent milieu for ourselves. Heidegger further develop the concept Besorgen to describe the concernful mode of being with tools, and Fürsorgen to describe two positive mode of care4. The political implication of Besorgen is that today our everyday life dealing with archives, for example searching on Goolge, updating Facebook, or other activities of crowd sourcing, are naturalized as habitude, as something unquestionable.

In contrary, Fürsorgen is at the same time worries of not being able to be there and affirmation that one can have of oneself. If we are allow to say so, one is passive, like affections, emotions; the other is active, anticipations and preparation for the future. What is crucial in Fürsorgen is act to “look back”. The late Foucault's concern of care resonates with the change in the perception of power of discourse to the self- development and practice of discourses. When Foucault wrote le souci de soi (care of the self), he means the practice of care, one occupies oneself, as Heidegger's nachsichtand zurücksicht both worries and affirmations. Foucault uses the example of the figure Socrates, who keeps on asking young people on the street “are you occupying yourself” even in face of his death. This practice of care is like librarians are able to take care of books, wiping away dusts on the cover, putting them on the right places, relating books to different themes, by taking these objects they create an associate milieu for objects and themselves. Of course not all librarians are like this, but this librarian metaphor emphasize links between objects and archives5. In contrast, the deprivation of care is one that systematically destroy these care structures by alienating the relation between objects and individuals. For example, users are seen merely as producers of data and those who can contribute to different sorts of crowd sourcing. At heart of the question of archive is the question of care, and I think today in order to care, one must think of archive, the exteriorisation of our memories, gestures, speeches, movements. Search engines, social networks, what one can call info-capitalism operates in the direction to transform care into something efficient and computable. By the end, we are no longer be able to organize these traces, but leave them on the cloud to be taken care by others.

§3. technics

What an archivist needs is not only his or her love of objects, but also skills or technics of care. Care like power, is not substance, but relations that is modified according to its material conditions. The technics of care and the technologies of care coincide in the context of archives. While this technological culture of archiving is not yet there, we must bring it back to the table. I want to associate this question with the French philosopher Gilbert Simondon, not only because Simondon proposed to take care of technical objects (that would be digital objects in our case), but, also, Simondon envisaged a technological culture as a possible solution to the question of alienation specifically, and the opposition between culture and technology in general. This imagination of technological culture was projected through the encyclopedianism of the Enlightenment. Simondon saw the emergence of encyclopedia as the first time in history that technics such as making glass, porcelains, weaving are presented to the public. Lets recall that one of the goals of the encyclopaedia is to ‘publish all the secrets of manufacturing’. In the 17 folio letter press volumes of the encyclopaedia, about 2,900 plates in 11 folio volumes were devoted to technology.

But the paradox concerning technological development, is that the more advance technologies become, the further we may distance ourselves from it. There are two problematics associated with it: firstly machine became abstract knowledge, what presents to the workers is an interface of control, the know-how is reduced to pressing a button, feeding machine with raw materials; secondly the mechanisation of all artisan skills, create a tendency of diskilling among workers, since automation replaces man's position as a technical individual. Industrialisation amplifies this effect. On one hand, the concretization of technical objects as technical individuals joins hand in hand with abstractions of labour and knowledges, a button or a control panel hided away large amount of practical knowledge and social relations. On the other hand, the exchange between labour and capital bring labours in the the endless circle of capital reproduction. This is what Simondon understands as proletarianisation and alienation through his reading of Marx, that somehow bypasses the question of properties. Be careful here, I am not suggesting that one should avoid abstraction and reduction; not at all, abstraction and reductions are necessary in many aspects, but the question is rather what kind of reductions and abstractions: one that favours individuation or one that produces disindividuation. For example, one can drive a car by knowing its speed, its limit, and one who dives by only knowing pressing which button, in both case we are dealing with different kind of abstractions. Today, Google and Facebook are doing the latter, we are used to press buttons, satisfy ourselves with the speed and convenience, without really understanding the problematics behind interfaces and its crowdsourcing algorithms.

Simondon argues against automation, for him automation is the lowest level of perfection of technical objects. Simondon proposes to take into account of the “margin of indetermination” in the invention of machine. It means the machine of higher level shouldn't be perfectly automatic, but needs to integrate human being in the technical ensemble as one that operates it, one that lives with it. This cannot be understood simply that human beings are users, instead they must restore their position as technical individuals. For Simondon it makes no sense to return to the craftsmanship as negation of industrialisation. According to his analysis, “human individuality finds itself more and more disengaged from the technical function by the construction of technical individual – but it creates actually a malaise, because human, always searching to be technical individual, no longer has a stable place next to machine: he becomes servant of machine or organisers of technical ensemble6”. The question is no longer one that savages machines and factories, but to invent a new conception of technical knowledge that reconstitute the culture of machine that is driven by capital and marketing. This is what Simondon calls a technological humanism, which “ aims at the most serious aspect of alienation that a civilisation behaves or produces”, so “each epoch should discover its humanism, and orienting it towards the principle danger of alienation”7. Simondon observes that work is only a phase of technicity, instead that technicity is part of work8. In our context, the problem of crowdsourcing as work is that the users don't know what they are contributing for, while they are virtually working through searching, typing status update. While this relationship between technicity and work, lays the possibility of overcoming the limitation of works by retrieving the potential of technicity.

Under these theoretical interpretation, the archivist manifesto is a proposal to regain the knowledge and skills of organising data and digital objects; only with the technology, can we take about the technics of care, that is also a humanism called by its technical reality. In summary, what I tried to do above is to re-conceptualize archives and archivists after the web, and propose to take this possibility to re-appropriate archives, by reflecting on the question of industrialisation of archives vis-à-vis the question of care, and the development of archival tools embeds a large extent of diskilling. The current discussions on search, open access, archives, preservation of information and digital objects, often hide away the politics of individuals under the disguise of “users”. Users to technological capitalism, are consumers to consumerist capitalism. Archivist manifesto is a call for the reinsertion of knowledge and skills for developing personal archives, that on one hand, reinstall the culture of care and a technological culture; on the other hand, develop an infrastructure that allows sharing of information on individual level and bypasses marketing tools such as search engines and commercial social networks. The following points briefly summarise three practices toward the archive culture:

on the technological side, one should become archivist instead of users, and manage one's own digital objects and data, in order to create personal archives; software developers should pay attention to the development of softwares for personal archives of digital objects. This includes indexation, annotation of digital objects and the portability of data and metadata from one individual archive to another archive or another system; these metadata and annotation can be used for search use.

opening up institutional archives and allows self-archiving, meaning archivists can download these digital objects. Institutional archives can still keep their own objects in a single place, but if users can download, share and annotate their own collections, and then contribute their metadata to institutional archives, this will significantly vitalize archives and move further from the ambition of the moderns described by Foucault (e.g. decentralized archive).

individual archives can share with each other. This may recall us of the early idea of Napster, an idea based on P2P sharing. But it is not exactly the same, since in the framework I proposed, at centre is not the question of exchange of good, but rather of care, of preserving and giving, to get away from the crowdsourcing logic and most importantly to imagine a technological humanism, as was once proposed by Gilbert Simondon.

1 The idea of accumulating everything, of establishing a sort of general archive, the will to enclose in one place all times, all epochs, all forms, all tastes, the idea of constituting a place of all times that is itself outside of time and inaccessible to its ravages, the project of organizing in this way a sort of perpetual and indefinite accumulation of time in an immobile place, this whole idea belongs to our modernity.

The first decade of the 21st century, the so-called ‘naughties’, has brought profound changes to the technological foundations of the media landscape. The key buzzwords are networks, the Internet and social media. In the second decade, people will not search for new technologies allowing for even easier, faster and low-priced content production. Rather, appropriate reactions to this media revolution are to be developed and integrated politically, culturally and socially. The concept “Slow”, as in “Slow Food” and not as in “Slow Down”, is a key for this. Like “Slow Food”, Slow Media are not about fast consumption but about choosing the ingredients mindfully and preparing them in a concentrated manner. Slow Media are welcoming and hospitable. They like to share.

1. Slow Media are a contribution to sustainability. Sustainability relates to the raw materials, processes and working conditions, which are the basis for media production. Exploitation and low-wage sectors as well as the unconditional commercialization of user data will not result in sustainable media. At the same time, the term refers to the sustainable consumption of Slow Media.

2. Slow media promote Monotasking. Slow Media cannot be consumed casually, but provoke the full concentration of their users. As with the production of a good meal, which demands the full attention of all senses by the cook and his guests, Slow Media can only be consumed with pleasure in focused alertness.

3. Slow Media aim at perfection. Slow Media do not necessarily represent new developments on the market. More important is the continuous improvement of reliable user interfaces that are robust, accessible and perfectly tailored to the media usage habits of the people.

4. Slow Media make quality palpable. Slow Media measure themselves in production, appearance and content against high standards of quality and stand out from their fast-paced and short-lived counterparts – by some premium interface or by an aesthetically inspiring design.

5. Slow Media advance Prosumers, i.e. people who actively define what and how they want to consume and produce. In Slow Media, the active Prosumer, inspired by his media usage to develop new ideas and take action, replaces the passive consumer. This may be shown by marginals in a book or animated discussion about a record with friends. Slow Media inspire, continuously affect the users’ thoughts and actions and are still perceptible years later.

6. Slow Media are discursive and dialogic. They long for a counterpart with whom they may come in contact. The choice of the target media is secondary. In Slow Media, listening is as important as speaking. Hence ‘Slow’ means to be mindful and approachable and to be able to regard and to question one’s own position from a different angle.

7. Slow Media are Social Media. Vibrant communities or tribes constitute around Slow Media. This, for instance, may be a living author exchanging thoughts with his readers or a community interpreting a late musician’s work. Thus Slow Media propagate diversity and respect cultural and distinctive local features.

8. Slow Media respect their users. Slow Media approach their users in a self-conscious and amicable way and have a good idea about the complexity or irony their users can handle. Slow Media neither look down on their users nor approach them in a submissive way.

9. Slow Media are distributed via recommendations not advertising: the success of Slow Media is not based on an overwhelming advertising pressure on all channels but on recommendation from friends, colleagues or family. A book given as a present five times to best friends is a good example.

10. Slow Media are timeless: Slow Media are long-lived and appear fresh even after years or decades. They do not lose their quality over time but at best get some patina that can even enhance their value.

11. Slow Media are auratic: Slow Media emanate a special aura. They generate a feeling that the particular medium belongs to just that moment of the user’s life. Despite the fact that they are produced industrially or are partially based on industrial means of production, they are suggestive of being unique and point beyond themselves.

12. Slow Media are progressive not reactionary: Slow Media rely on their technological achievements and the network society’s way of life. It is because of the acceleration of multiple areas of life, that islands of deliberate slowness are made possible and essential for survival. Slow Media are not a contradiction to the speed and simultaneousness of Twitter, Blogs or Social Networks but are an attitude and a way of making use of them.

13. Slow Media focus on quality both in production and in reception of media content: Craftsmanship in cultural studies such as source criticism, classification and evaluation of sources of information are gaining importance with the increasing availability of information.

14. Slow Media ask for confidence and take their time to be credible. Behind Slow Media are real people. And you can feel that.

Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.

We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.

Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions.

You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your impositions.

You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social Contract . This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours. Our world is different.

Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.

We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.

We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.

Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here.

Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge . Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.

In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams must now be born anew in us.

You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.

In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media.

Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.

These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.

We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.

Excerpt from a newspaper of the future: ""A man was checked yesterday at the Franco-Italian border. The inspection of his computer revealed that it harbored pirated products, mainly Adobe software and music of the Beatles. The man was arrested on the spot. ""

Whether it's a poem or a drug, or a software disk, a film or a book, anything that is popular and profitable should the majority of its value economic handling of crowds. No one asked to get a Coca-Cola logo, or to know the chorus of ""Like a Virgin"". Education, Media and Propaganda we are swallowed by force, hammering at will or by speculating on our thirst, our hunger, our need for communication and entertainment, and above all our loneliness and our malaise. In the age of Internet, which can be copied can be shared. In terms of content, one can distribute, to everyone at the same time. 

In light of this finding, a new class emerges. It is not a working class but a class of producers. In essence, these producers are pirates and hackers; they reuse the images, sounds, and ideas of the world. They create some, but mostly they borrow from others. 

The information is now part of our body, it is literally ""installed"" in our brain, and we can not delete on request. That is why we have the right to possess the information we projected, we are right to be masters of ourselves! Because we live in globalized societies built on inequality and profit, because the content of a song, a movie or a book are assets in a struggle to survive without thank you, every citizen has the moral right to take a digital copy of a work whatsoever. Because IT is an international language, the secrets of the world are nowadays written in Adobe and Microsoft, it is legitimate to the hacker. Finally, because poverty is the experimental field of pharmaceutical industry, medicine should be free of any patent. 

Nowadays, anyone with a computer is both producer and Pirate. We are all citizens of the Internet, this is our new nation, the only territory it is justified to defend and protect. Internet is a land of information and knowledge. Everyone should be able to trample without financial consideration; only large companies should pay to use it. 

Internet generates ""Internets"" situations that exist not only online but also in the physical world, determined by what happens on the network. The time has come to establish a Global Movement piracy. Freedom to infringe copyright, the unrestricted access to knowledge and medical treatments, these are our new ""commons."" These are universal rights, and as such, the authorities did not concede without a fight, but the fight will deliver unique because for the first time, crowds spontaneously break the law on a global scale. 

Today, everyone copy: young people, adults, our seniors, voters left and right. Anyone with a computer copy something. Such a new Athena Information springs fully armed from the open skull Technology to help us in our quest.

Introduction

Jaron Lanier, a pioneer in virtual reality, musician, and currently the lead scientist for the National Tele-Immersion Initiative, worries about the future of human culture more than the gadgets. In his ""Half a Manifesto"" he takes on those he terms the ""cybernetic totalists"" who do not seem ""to not have been educated in the tradition of scientific skepticism. I understand why they are intoxicated. There IS a compelling simple logic behind their thinking and elegance in thought is infectious.""

""There is a real chance that evolutionary psychology, artificial intelligence, Moore's Law fetishizing, and the rest of the package, will catch on in a big way, as big as Freud or Marx did in their times. Or bigger, since these ideas might end up essentially built into the software that runs our society and our lives. If that happens, the ideology of cybernetic totalist intellectuals will be amplified from novelty into a force that could cause suffering for millions of people.

""The greatest crime of Marxism wasn't simply that much of what it claimed was false, but that it claimed to be the sole and utterly complete path to understanding life and reality. Cybernetic eschatology shares with some of history's worst ideologies a doctrine of historical predestination. There is nothing more gray, stultifying, or dreary than a life lived inside the confines of a theory. Let us hope that the cybernetic totalists learn humility before their day in the sun arrives.""

ONE HALF A MANIFESTO

[JARON LANIER:] And so I'll here share my thoughts with the respondents of edge.org, many of whom are, as much as anyone, responsible for this revolution, one which champions the assent of cybernetic technology as culture.

The dogma I object to is composed of a set of interlocking beliefs and doesn't have a generally accepted overarching name as yet, though I sometimes call it ""cybernetic totalism"". It has the potential to transform human experience more powerfully than any prior ideology, religion, or political system ever has, partly because it can be so pleasing to the mind, at least initially, but mostly because it gets a free ride on the overwhelmingly powerful technologies that happen to be created by people who are, to a large degree, true believers.

Edge readers might be surprised by my use of the word ""cybernetic"". I find the word problematic, so I'd like to explain why I chose it. I searched for a term that united the diverse ideas I was exploring, and also connected current thinking and culture with earlier generations of thinkers who touched on similar topics. The original usage of ""cybernetic"", as by Norbert Weiner, was certainly not restricted to digital computers. It was originally meant to suggest a metaphor between marine navigation and a feedback device that governs a mechanical system, such as a thermostat. Weiner certainly recognized and humanely explored the extraordinary reach of this metaphor, one of the most powerful ever expressed.

I hope no one will think I'm equating Cybernetics and what I'm calling Cybernetic Totalism. The distance between recognizing a great metaphor and treating it as the only metaphor is the same as the distance between humble science and dogmatic religion.

Here is a partial roster of the component beliefs of cybernetic totalism:

1) That cybernetic patterns of information provide the ultimate and best way to understand reality. 

2) That people are no more than cybernetic patterns. 

3) That subjective experience either doesn't exist, or is unimportant because it is some sort of ambient or peripheral effect. 

4) That what Darwin described in biology, or something like it, is in fact also the singular, superior description of all creativity and culture. 


5) That qualitative as well as quantitative aspects of inform
ation systems will be accelerated by Moore's Law.

And finally, the most dramatic:

6) That biology and physics will merge with computer science (becoming biotechnology and nanotechnology), resulting in life and the physical universe becoming mercurial; achieving the supposed nature of computer software. Furthermore, all of this will happen very soon! Since computers are improving so quickly, they will overwhelm all the other cybernetic processes, like people, and will fundamentally change the nature of what's going on in the familiar neighborhood of Earth at some moment when a new ""criticality"" is achieved- maybe in about the year 2020. To be a human after that moment will be either impossible or something very different than we now can know.

During the last twenty years a stream of books has gradually informed the larger public about the belief structure of the inner circle of Digerati, starting softly, for instance with Godel, Escher, Bach, and growing more harsh with recent entries such as The Age of Spiritual Machines by Ray Kurtzweil.

Recently, public attention has finally been drawn to #6, the astonishing belief in an eschatological cataclysm in our lifetimes, brought about when computers become the ultra-intelligent masters of physical matter and life. So far as I can tell, a large number of my friends and colleagues believe in some version of this immanent doom.

I am quite curious who, among the eminent thinkers who largely accept some version of the first five points, are also comfortable with the sixth idea, the eschatology. In general, I find that technologists, rather than natural scientists, have tended to be vocal about the possibility of a near-term criticality. I have no idea, however, what figures like Richard Dawkins or Daniel Dennett make of it. Somehow I can't imagine these elegant theorists speculating about whether nanorobots might take over the planet in twenty years. It seems beneath their dignity. And yet, the eschatologies of Kurtzweil, Moravec, and Drexler follow directly and, it would seem, inevitably, from an understanding of the world that has been most sharply articulated by none other than Dawkins and Dennett. Do Dawkins, Dennett, and others in their camp see some flaw in logic that insulates their thinking from the eschatological implications? The primary candidate for such a flaw as I see it is that cyber-armageddonists have confused ideal computers with real computers, which behave differently. My position on this point can be evaluated separately from my admittedly provocative positions on the first five points, and I hope it will be.

Why this is only ""one half of a manifesto"": I hope that readers will not think that I've sunk into some sort of glum rejection of digital technology. In fact, I'm more delighted than ever to be working in computer science and I find that it's rather easy to adopt a humanistic framework for designing digital tools. There is a lovely global flowering of computer culture already in place, arising for the most independently of the technological elites, which implicitly rejects the ideas I am attacking here. A full manifesto would attempt to describe and promote this positive culture.

I will now examine the five beliefs that must precede acceptance of the new eschatology, and then consider the eschatology itself.

Here we go:

Cybernetic Totalist Belief #1: That cybernetic patterns of information provide the ultimate and best way to understand reality.

There is an undeniable rush of excitement experienced by those who first are able to perceive a phenomenon cybernetically. For example, while I believe I can imagine what a thrill it must have been to use early photographic equipment in the 19th century, I can't imagine that any outsider could comprehend the sensation of being around early computer graphics technology in the nineteen-seventies. For here was not merely a way to make and show images, but a metaframework that subsumed all possible images. Once you can understand something in a way that you can shove it into a computer, you have cracked its code, transcended any particularity it might have at a given time. It was as if we had become the Gods of vision and had effectively created all possible images, for they would merely be reshufflings of the bits in the computers we had before us, completely under our command.

The cybernetic impulse is initially driven by ego (though, as we shall see, in its end game, which has not yet arrived, it will become the enemy of ego). For instance, Cybernetic Totalists look at culture and see ""memes"", or autonomous mental tropes that compete for brain space in humans somewhat like viruses. In doing so they not only accomplish a triumph of ""campus imperialism"", placing themselves in an imagined position of superior understanding vs. the whole of the humanities, but they also avoid having to pay much attention to the particulars of culture in a given time and place. Once you have subsumed something into its cybernetic reduction, any particular reshuffling of its bits seems unimportant.

Belief #1 appeared on the stage almost immediately with the first computers. It was articulated by the first generation of computer scientists; Weiner, Shannon, Turing. It is so fundamental that it isn't even stated anymore within the inner circle. It is so well rooted that it is difficult for me to remove myself from my all-encompassing intellectual environment long enough to articulate an alternative to it.

An alternative might be this: A cybernetic model of a phenomenon can never be the sole favored model, because we can't even build computers that conform to such models. Real computers are completely different from the ideal computers of theory. They break for reasons that are not always analyzable, and they seem to intrinsically resist many of our endeavors to improve them, in large part due to legacy and lock-in, among other problems. We imagine ""pure"" cybernetic systems but we can only prove we know how to build fairly dysfunctional ones. We kid ourselves when we think we understand something, even a computer, merely because we can model or digitize it.

There is also an epistemological problem that bothers me, even though my colleagues by and large are willing to ignore it. I don't think you can measure the function or even the existence of a computer without a cultural context for it. I don't think Martians would necessarily be able to distinguish a Macintosh from a space heater.

The above disputes ultimately turn on a combination of technical arguments about information theory and philosophical positions that largely arise from taste and faith.

So I try to augment my positions with pragmatic considerations, and some of these will begin to appear in my thoughts on...

Belief #2: That people are no more than cybernetic patterns

Every cybernetic totalist fantasy relies on artificial intelligence. It might not immediately be apparent why such fantasies are essential to those who have them. If computers are to become smart enough to design their own successors, initiating a process that will lead to God-like omniscience after a number of ever swifter passages from one generation of computers to the next, someone is going to have to write the software that gets the process going, and humans have given absolutely no evidence of being able to write such software. So the idea is that the computers will somehow become smart on their own and write their own software.

My primary objection to this way of thinking is pragmatic: It results in the creation of poor quality real world software in the present. Cybernetic Totalists live with their heads in the future and are willing to accept obvious flaws in present software in support of a fantasy world that might never appear.

The whole enterprise of Artificial Intelligence is based on an intellectual mistake, and continues to expensively turn out poorly designed software as it is re-marketed under a new name for every new generation of programmers. Lately it has been called ""intelligent agents"". Last time around it was called ""expert systems"".

Let's start at the beginning, when the idea first appeared. In Turing's famous thought experiment, a human judge is asked to determine which of two correspondents is human, and which is machine. If the judge cannot tell, Turing asserts that the computer should be treated as having essentially achieved the moral and intellectual status of personhood.

Turing's mistake was that he assumed that the only explanation for a successful computer entrant would be that the computer had become elevated in some way; by becoming smarter, more human. There is another, equally valid explanation of a winning computer, however, which is that the human had become less intelligent, less human-like.

An official Turing Test is held every year, and while the substantial cash prize has not been claimed by a program as yet, it will certainly be won sometime in the coming years. My view is that this event is distracting everyone from the real Turing Tests that are already being won. Real, though miniature, Turing Tests are happening all the time, every day, whenever a person puts up with stupid computer software.

For instance, in the United States, we organize our financial lives in order to look good to the pathetically simplistic computer programs that determine our credit ratings. We borrow money when we don't need to, for example, to feed the type of data to the programs that we know they are programmed to respond to favorably.

In doing this, we make ourselves stupid in order to make the computer software seem smart. In fact we continue to trust the credit rating software even though there has been an epidemic of personal bankruptcies during a time of very low unemployment and great prosperity.

We have caused the Turing test to be passed. There is no epistemological difference between artificial intelligence and the acceptance of badly designed computer software.

My argument can be taken as an attack against the belief in eventual computer sentience, but a more sophisticated reading would be that it argues for a pragmatic advantage to holding an anti-AI belief (because those who believe in AI are more likely to put up with bad software). More importantly, I'm hoping the reader can see that Artificial Intelligence is better understood as a belief system instead of a technology.

The AI belief system is a direct explanation for a lot of bad software in the world, such as the annoying features in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint that guess at what the user really wanted to type. Almost every person I have asked has hated these features, and I have never met an engineer at Microsoft who could successfully turn the features completely off on my computer (running Mac Office '98), even though that is supposed to be possible.

Belief #3: That subjective experience either doesn't exist, or is unimportant because it is some sort of ambient or peripheral effect.

There is a new moral struggle taking shape over the question of when ""souls"" should be attributed to perceived patterns in the world.

Computers, genes, and the economy are some of the entities which appear to Cybernetic Totalists to populate reality today, along with human beings. It is certainly true that we are confronted with non-human and meta-human actors in our lives on a constant basis and these players sometimes appear to be more powerful than us.

So, the new moral question is: Do we make decisions solely on the basis of the needs and wants of ""traditional"" biological humans, or are any of these other players deserving of consideration?

I propose to make use of a simple image to consider the alternative points of view. This image is of an imaginary circle that each person draws around him/herself. We shall call this ""the circle of empathy"". On the inside of the circle are those things that are considered deserving of empathy, and the corresponding respect, rights, and practical treatment as approximate equals. On the outside of the circle are those things that are considered less important, less alive, less deserving of rights. (This image is only a tool for thought, and should certainly not be taken as my complete model for human psychology or moral dilemmas.) Roughly speaking, liberals hope to expand the circle, while conservatives wish to contract it.

Should computers, perhaps at some point in the future, be placed inside the ""circle of empathy""? The idea that they should is held close to the heart by the Cybernetic Totalists, who populate the elite technological academies and the businesses of the ""new economy"".

There has often been a tender, but unintended humor in the argumentative writing by advocates of eventual computer sentience. The quest to rationally prove the possibility of sentience in a computer (or perhaps in the internet), is the modern version of proving God's existence. As is the case with the history of God, a great many great minds have spent excesses of energy on this quest, and eventually a cybernetically-minded 21st century version of Kant will appear in order to present a tedious ""proof"" that such adventures are futile. I simply don't have the patience to be that person.

As it happens, in the last five years or so arguments about computer sentience have started to subside. The idea is assumed to be true by most of my colleagues; for them, the argument is over. It is not over for me.

I must report that back when the arguments were still white hot, it was the oddest feeling to debate someone like Cybernetic Totalist philosopher Daniel Dennett. He would state that humans were simply specialized computers, and that imposing some fundamental ontological distinction between humans and computers was a sentimental waste of time.

""But don't you experience your life? Isn't experience something apart from what you could measure in a computer?"", I would say. My debating opponent would typically say something like ""Experience is just an illusion created because there is one part of a machine (you) that needs to create a model of the function of the rest of the machine- that part is your experiential center.""

I would retort that experience is the only thing that isn't reduced by illusion. That even illusion is itself experience. A correlate, alas, is that experience is the very thing that can only be experienced. This lead me into the odd position of publicly wondering if some of my opponents simply lacked internal experience. (I once suggested that among all humanity, one could only definitively prove a lack of internal experience in certain professional philosophers.)

In truth, I think my perennial antagonists do have internal experience but choose not to admit it in public for a variety of reasons, most often because they enjoy annoying others.

Another motivation might be the ""Campus Imperialism"" I invoked earlier. Representatives of each academic discipline occasionally assert that they possess a most privileged viewpoint that somehow contains or subsumes the viewpoints of their rivals. Physicists were the alpha-academics for much of the twentieth century, though in recent decades ""postmodern"" humanities thinkers managed to stage something of a comeback, at least in their own minds. But technologists are the inevitable winners of this game, as they change the very components of our lives out from under us. It is tempting to many of them, apparently, to leverage this power to suggest that they also possess an ultimate understanding of reality, which is something quite apart from having tremendous influence on it.

Another avenue of explanation might be neo-Freudian, considering that the primary inventor of the idea of machine sentience, Alan Turing, was such a tortured soul. Turing died in an apparent suicide brought on by his having developed breasts as a result of enduring a hormonal regimen intended to reverse his homosexuality. It was during this tragic final period of his life that he argued passionately for machine sentience, and I have wondered whether he was engaging in a highly original new form of psychological escape and denial; running away from sexuality and mortality by becoming a computer.

At any rate, what is peculiar and revealing is that my cybernetic totalist friends confuse the viability of a perspective with its triumphant superiority. It is perfectly true that one can think of a person as a gene's way of propagating itself, as per Dawkins, or as a sexual organ used by machines to make more machines, as per McLuhan (as quoted in the masthead of every issue of Wired Magazine), and indeed it can even be beautiful to think from these perspectives from time to time. As the anthropologist Steve Barnett pointed out, however, it would be just as reasonable to assert that ""A person is shit's way of making more shit.""

So let us pretend that the new Kant has already appeared and done his/her inevitable work. We can then say: The placement of one's circle of empathy is ultimately a matter of faith. We must accept the fact that we are forced to place the circle somewhere, and yet we cannot exclude extra-rational faith from our choice of where to place it.

My personal choice is to not place computers inside the circle. In this article I am stating some of my pragmatic, esthetic, and political reasons for this, though ultimately my decision rests on my particular faith. My position is unpopular and even resented in my professional and social environment.

Belief #4: That what Darwin described in biology, or something like it, is in fact also the singular, superior description of all possible creativity and culture.

Cybernetic totalists are obsessed with Darwin, for he described the closest thing we have to an algorithm for creativity. Darwin answers what would otherwise be a big hole in the Dogma: How will cybernetic systems be smart and creative enough to invent a post-human world? In order to embrace an eschatology in which the computers become smart as they become fast, some kind of Deus ex Machina must be invoked, and it has a beard.

Unfortunately, in the current climate I must take a moment to state that I am not a creationist. I am in this essay criticizing what I perceive to be intellectual laziness; a retreat from trying to understand problems and instead hope for software that evolves itself. I am not suggesting that Nature required some extra element beyond natural evolution to create people.

I also don't meant to imply that there is a completely unified block of people opposing me, all of whom think exactly the same thoughts. There are in fact numerous variations of Darwinian eschatology. Some of the most dramatic renditions have not come from scientists or engineers, but from writers such as Kevin Kelly and Robert Wright, who have become entranced with broadened interpretations of Darwin. In their works, reality is perceived as a big computer program running the Darwin algorithm, perhaps headed towards some sort of Destiny.

Many of my technical colleagues also see at least some form of a causal arrow in evolution pointing to an ever greater degree of a hard-to-characterize something as time passes. The words used to describe that something are themselves hard to define; It is said to include increased complexity, organization, and representation. To computer scientist Danny Hillis, people seem to have more of such a thing than, say, single cell organisms, and it is natural to wonder if perhaps there will someday be some new creatures with even more of it than is found in people. (And of course the future birth of the new ""more so"" species is usually said to be related to computers.) Contrast this perspective with that of Stephen Jay Gould who argues in Full House that if there's an arrow in evolution, it's towards greater diversity over time, and we unlikely creatures known as humans, having arisen as one tiny manifestation of a massive, blind exploration of possible creatures, only imagine that the whole process was designed to lead to us.

There is no harder idea to test than an anthropic one, or its refutation. I'll admit that I tend to side with Gould on this one, but it is more important to point out an epistemological conundrum that should be considered by Darwinian eshatologists. If mankind is the measure of evolution thus far, then we will also be the measure of successor species that might be purported to be ""more evolved"" than us. We'll have to anthropomorphize in order to perceive this ""greater than human"" form of life, especially if it exists inside an information space such as the internet.

In other words, we'll be as reliable in assessing the status of the new super-beings as we are in assessing the traits of pet dogs in the present. We aren't up to the task. Before you tell me that it will be overwhelmingly obvious when the superintelligent new cyber-species arrives, visit a dog show. Or a gathering of people who believe they have been abducted by aliens in UFOs. People are demonstrably insane when it comes to assessing non-human sentience.

There is, however, no question that the movement to interpret Darwin more broadly, and in particular to bring him into psychology and the humanities has offered some luminous insights that will someday be part of an improved understanding of nature, including human nature. I enjoy this stream of thought on various levels. It's also, let's admit it, impossible for a computer scientist not to be flattered by works which place what is essentially a form of algorithmic computation at the center of reality, and these thinkers tend to be confident and crisp and to occasionally have new and good ideas.

And yet I think cybernetic totalist Darwinians are often brazenly incompetent at public discourse and may be in part responsible, however unintentionally, for inciting a resurgence of fundamentalist religious reaction against rational biology. They seem to come up with takes on Darwin that are calculated to not only antagonize, but alienate those who don't share their views. Declarations from the ""nerdiest"" of the evolutionary psychologists can be particularly irritating.

One example that comes to mind is the recent book, The Natural History of Rape by Randy Thornhill and Craig T. Palmer, declaring that rape is a ""natural"" way to spread genes around. We have seen all sorts of propositions tied to Darwin with a veneer of rationality. In fact you can argue almost any position using a Darwinian strategy.

For instance, Thornhill and Palmer go so far as to suggest that those who disagree with them are victims of evolutionary programming for the need to believe in a fictitious altruism in human nature. The authors say it is altruistic-seeming to not believe in evolutionary psychology, because such skepticism makes a public display of one's belief in brotherly love. Displays of altruism are said to be attractive, and therefore to improve one's ability to lure mates. By this logic, evolutionary psychologists should soon breed themselves out of the population. Unless they resort to rape.

At any rate, Darwin's idea of evolution was of a different order than scientific theories that had come before, for at least two reasons. The most obvious and explosive reason was that the subject matter was so close to home. It was a shock to the 19th century mind to think of animals as blood relatives, and that shock continues to this day.

The second reason is less often recognized. Darwin created a style of reduction that was based on emergent principles instead of underlying laws (though some recent speculative physics theories can have a Darwinian flavor). There isn't any evolutionary ""force"" analogous to, say, electromagnetism. Evolution is a principle that can be discerned as emerging in events, but it cannot be described precisely as a force that directs events. This is a subtle distinction. The story of each photon is the same, in a way that the story of each animal and plant is different. (Of course there are wonderful examples of precise, quantitative statements Darwinian theory and corresponding experiments, but these don't take place at anywhere close to the level of human experience, which is whole organisms that have complex behaviors in environments.) ""Story"" is the operative word. Evolutionary thought has almost always been applied to specific situations through stories.

A story, unlike a theory, invites embroidery and variation, and indeed stories gain their communicative power by resonance with more primal stories. It is possible to learn physics without inventing a narrative in one's head to give meaning to photons and black holes. But it seems that it is impossible to learn Darwinian evolution without also developing an internal narrative to relate it to other stories one knows. At least no public thinker on the subject seems to have confronted Darwin without building a bridge to personal value systems.

But beyond the question of subjective flavoring, there remains the problem of whether Darwin has explained enough. Is it not possible that there remains an as-yet unarticulated idea that explains aspects of achievement and creativity that Darwin does not?

For instance, is Darwinian-styled explanation sufficient to understand the process of rational thought? There are a plethora of recent theories in which the brain is said to produce random distributions of subconscious ideas that compete with one another until only the best one has survived, but do these theories really fit with what people do?

In nature, evolution appears to be brilliant at optimizing, but stupid at strategizing. (The mathematical image that expresses this idea is that ""blind"" evolution has enourmous trouble getting unstuck from a local minima in an energy landscape.) The classic question would be: How could evolution have made such marvelous feet, claws, fins, and paws, but have missed the wheel? There are plenty of environments in which creatures would benefit from wheels, so why haven't any appeared? Not even once? (A great long term art project for some rebellious kid in school now: Genetically engineer an animal with wheels! See if DNA can be made to do it.)

People came up with the wheel and numerous other useful inventions that seem to have eluded evolution. It is possible that the explanation is simply that hands had access to a different set of inventions than DNA, even though both were guided by similar processes. But it seems to me premature to treat such an interpretation as a certainty. Is it not possible that in rational thought the brain does some as yet unarticulated thing that might have originated in a Darwinian process, but that cannot be explained by it?

The first two or three generations of artificial intelligence researchers took it as a given that blind evolution in itself couldn't be the whole of the story, and assumed that there were elements that distinguished human mentation from other Earthly processes. For instance, humans were thought by many to build abstract representations of the world in their minds, while the process of evolution needn't do that. Furthermore, these representations seemed to possess extraordinary qualities like the fearsome and perpetually elusive ""common sense"". After decades of failed attempts to build similar abstractions in computers, the field of AI gave up, but without admitting it. Surrender was couched as merely a series of tactical retreats. AI these days is often conceived as more of a craft than a branch of science or engineering. A great many practitioners I've spoken with lately hope to see software evolve that does various things but seem to have sunk to an almost ""post-modern"", or cynical lack of concern with understanding how these gizmos might actually work.

It is important to remember that craft-based cultures can come up with plenty of useful technologies, and that the motivation for our predecessors to embrace the Enlightenment and the ascent of rationality was not just to make more technologies more quickly. There was also the idea of Humanism, and a belief in the goodness of rational thinking and understanding. Are we really ready to abandon that?

Finally, there is an empirical point to be made: There has now been over a decade of work worldwide in Darwinian approaches to generating software, and while there have been some fascinating and impressive isolated results, and indeed I enjoy participating in such research, nothing has arisen from the work that would make software in general any better- as I'll ddescribe in the next section.

So, while I love Darwin, I won't count on him to write code. 

Belief #5: That qualitative as well as quantitative aspects of information systems will be accelerated by Moore's Law.

The hardware side of computers keeps on getting better and cheaper at an exponential rate known by the moniker ""Moore's Law"". Every year and a half or so computation gets roughly twice as fast for a given cost. The implications of this are dizzying and so profound that they induce vertigo on first apprehension. What could a computer that was a million times faster than the one I am writing this text on be able to do? Would such a computer really be incapable of doing whatever it is my human brain does? The quantity of a ""million"" is not only too large to grasp intuitively, it is not even accessible experimentally for present purposes, so speculation is not irrational. What is stunning is to realize that many of us will find out the answer in our lifetimes, for such a computer might be a cheap consumer product in about, say 30 years.

This breathtaking vista must be starkly contrasted with the Great Shame of computer science, which is that we don't seem to be able to write software much better as computers get much faster. Computer software continues to disappoint. How I hated UNIX back in the seventies - that devilish accumulator of data trash, obscurer of function, enemy of the user! If anyone had told me back then that getting back to embarrassingly primitive UNIX would be the great hope and investment obsession of the year 2000, merely because it's name was changed to LINUX and its source code was opened up again, I never would have had the stomach or the heart to continue in computer science.

If anything, there's a reverse Moore's Law observable in software: As processors become faster and memory becomes cheaper, software becomes correspondingly slower and more bloated, using up all available resources. Now I know I'm not being entirely fair here. We have better speech recognition and language translation than we used to, for example, and we are learning to run larger data bases and networks. But our core techniques and technologies for software simply haven't kept up with hardware. (Just as some newborn race of superintelligent robots are about to consume all humanity, our dear old species will likely be saved by a Windows crash. The poor robots will linger pathetically, begging us to reboot them, even though they'll know it would do no good.)

There are various reasons that software tends to be unwieldly, but a primary one is what I like to call ""brittleness"". Software breaks before it bends, so it demands perfection in a universe that prefers statistics. This in turn leads to all the pain of legacy/lock in, and other perversions. The distance between the ideal computers we imagine in our thought experiments and the real computers we know how to unleash on the world could not be more bitter.

It is the fetishizing of Moore's Law that seduces researchers into complacency. If you have an exponential force on your side, surely it will ace all challenges. Who cares about rational understanding when you can instead really on an exponential extra-human fetish? But processing power isn't the only thing that scales impressively; so do the problems that processors have to solve.

Here's an example I offer to non-technical people to illustrate this point. Ten years ago I had a laptop with an indexing program that let me search for files by content. In order to respond quickly enough when I performed a search, it went through all the files in advance and indexed them, just as search engines like Google index the internet today. The indexing process took about an hour.

Today I have a laptop that is hugely more capacious and faster in every dimension, as predicted by Moore's Law. However, I now have to let my indexing program run overnight to do its job. There are many other examples of computers seeming to get slower even though central processors are getting faster. Computer user interfaces tend to respond more slowly to user interface events, such as a keypress, than they did fifteen years ago, for instance. What's gone wrong?

The answer is complicated.

One part of the answer is fundamental. It turns out that when programs and datasets get bigger (and increasing storage and transmission capacities are driven by the same processes that drive Moore's exponential speedup), internal computational overhead often increases at a worse-than-linear rate. This is because of some nasty mathematical facts of life regarding algorithms. Making a problem twice as large usually makes it take a lot more than twice as long to solve. Some algorithms are worse in this way than others, and one aspect of getting a solid undergraduate education in computer science is learning about them. Plenty of problems have overheads that scale even more steeply than Moore's Law. Surprisingly few of the most essential algorithms have overheads that scale at a merely linear rate.

But that's only the beginning of the story. It's also true that if different parts of a system scale at different rates, and that's usually the case, one part might be overwhelmed by the other. In the case of my indexing program, the size of hard disks actually grew faster than the speed of interfaces to them. Overhead costs can be amplified by such examples of ""messy"" scaling, in which one part of a system cannot keep up with another. A bottleneck then appears, rather like girdlock in a poorly designed roadway. And the backup that results is just as bad as a morning commute on a typically inadequate roadway system. And just as tricky and expensive to plan for and prevent. (Trips on Manhattan streets were faster a hundred years ago than they are today. Horses are faster than cars.)

And then we come to our old antagonist, brittleness. The larger a piece of computer software gets, the more it is likely to be dominated by some form of legacy code, and the more brutal becomes the overhead of addressing the endless examples of subtle incompatibility that inevitably arise between chunks of software originally created in different contexts.

And even beyond these effects, there are failings of human character that worsen the state of software, and many of these are systemic and might arise even if non-human agents were writing the code. For instance, it is very time-consuming and expensive to plan ahead to make the tasks of future programmers easier, so each programmer tends to choose strategies that worsen the effects of brittleness. The time crunch faced by programmers is driven by none other than Moore's Law, which motivates an ever-faster turnaround of software revisions to get at least some form of mileage out of increasing processor speeds. So the result is often software that gets less efficient in some ways even as processors become faster.

I see no evidence that Moore's Law is steep enough to outrun all these problems without additional unforeseen intellectual achievements.

A fundamental statement of the question I'm examining here is: Does software tend to be unwieldly only because on human error, or is the difficulty intrinsic to the nature of software itself. If there is any credibility at all to the eschatological scenarios of Kurtzweil, Drexler, Moravec, et al, then this is the single most important question related to the future of mankind.

There is at least some metaphorical support for the possibility that software unwieldliness is intrinsic. In order to examine this possibility I'll have to break my own rule and be a cybernetic totalist for a moment.

Nature might seem to be less brittle than digital software, but if species are thought of as ""programs"", then it looks like nature also has a software crisis. Evolution itself has evolved, introducing sex, for instance, but evolution has never found a way to be any speed but very slow. This might be at least in part because it takes a long time to explore the space of possible variations of an exceedingly vast and complex causal system to find new configurations that are viable. Natural evolution's slowness as a medium of transformation is apparently systemic, rather than esulting from some inherent sluggishness in its component parts. On the contrary, adaptation is capable of achieving thrilling speed, in select circumstances. An example of fast change is the adaptation of germs to our efforts to eradicate them. Resistance to antibiotics is a notorious contemporary example of biological speed.

Both human-created software and natural selection seem to accrue hierarchies of layers that vary in their potential for speedy change. Slow-changing layers protect local theaters within which there is a potential for faster change. In computers, this is the divide between operating systems and applications, or between browsers and web pages. In biology, it might be seen, for example, in the divide between nature- and nurture-dominated dynamics in the human mind. But the lugubrious layers seem to usually define the overall character and potential of a system.

In the minds of some of my colleagues, all you have to do is identify one layer in a cybernetic system that's capable of fast change and then wait for Moore's Law to work it's magic. For instance, even if you're stuck with LINUX, you might implement a neural net program in it that eventually grows huge and fast enough (because of Moore's Law) to achieve a moment of insight and rewrite its own operating system. The problem is that in every example we know, a layer that can change fast also can't change very much. Germs can adopt to new drugs quickly, but would still take a very long time to evolve into Owls. This might be an inherent trade-off. For an example in the digital world, you can write a new JAVA applet pretty quickly, but it won't look very different from other quickly written applets- take a look at what's been done with applets and you'll see that this is true.

Now we finally come to...

Belief #6, the coming cybernetic cataclysm.

When a thoughtful person marvels at Moore's Law, there might be awe and there might be terror. One version of the terror was expressed recently by Bill Joy, in a cover story for Wired Magazine. Bill accepts the pronouncements of Ray Kurtzweil and others, who believe that Moore's Law will lead to autonomous machines, perhaps by the year 2020. That is the when computers will become, according to some estimates, about as powerful as human brains. (Not that anyone knows enough to really measure brains against computers yet. But for the sake of argument, let's suppose that the comparison is meaningful.) According to this scenario of the Terror, computers won't be stuck in boxes. They'll be more like robots, all connected together on the net, and they'll have a quite bag of tricks.

They'll be able to perform nano-manufacturing, for one thing. They'll quickly learn to reproduce and improve themselves. One fine day without warning, the new supermachines will brush humanity aside as casually as humans clear a forest for a new development. Or perhaps the machines will keep humans around to suffer the sort of indignity portrayed in the movie ""The Matrix"".

Even if the machines would otherwise choose to preserve their human progenitors, evil humans will be able to manipulate the machines to do vast harm to the rest of us. This is a different scenario that Bill also explores. Biotechnology will have advanced to the point that computer programs will be able to manipulate DNA as if it were Javascript. If computers can calculate the effects of drugs, genetic modifications, and other biological trickery, and if the tools to realize such tricks are cheap, then all it takes is a one madman to, say, create an epidemic targeted at a single race. Biotechnology without a strong, cheap information technology component would not be sufficiently potent to bring about this scenario. Rather, it is the ability of software running on fabulously fast computers to cheaply model and guide the manipulation of biology that is at the root of this variant of the Terror. I haven't been able to fully convey Bill's concerns in this brief account, but you get the idea.

My version of the Terror is different. We can already see how the biotechnology industry is setting itself up for decades of expensive software trouble. While there are all sorts of useful databases and modeling packages being developed by biotech firms and labs, they all exist in isolated developmental bubbles. Each such tool expects the world to conform to its requirements. Since the tools are so valuable, the world will do exactly that, but we should expect to see vast resources applied to the problem of getting data from bubble into another. There is no giant monolithic electronic brain being created with biological knowledge. There is instead a fractured mess of data and modeling fiefdoms. The medium for biological data transfer will continue to be sleep-deprived individual human researchers until some fabled future time when we know how to make software that is good at bridging bubbles on its own.

What is a long term future scenario like in which hardware keeps getting better and software remains mediocre? The great thing about crummy software is the amount of employment it generates. If Moore's Law is upheld for another twenty or thirty years, there will not only be a vast amount of computation going on Planet Earth, but also the maintenance of that computation will consume the efforts of almost every living person. We're talking about a planet of helpdesks.

I have argued elsewhere that this future would be a great thing, realizing the socialist dream of full employment by capitalist means. But let's consider the dark side.

Among the many processes that information systems make more efficient is the process of capitalism itself. A nearly friction-free economic environment allows fortunes to be accumulated in a few months instead of a few decades, but the individuals doing the accumulating are still living as long as they used to; longer, in fact. So those individuals who are good at getting rich have a chance to get richer before they die than their equally talented forebears.

There are two dangers in this. The smaller, more immediate danger is that young people acclimatized to a deliriously receptive economic environment might be emotionally wounded by what the rest of us would consider brief returns to normalcy. I do sometimes wonder if some of the students I work with who have gone on to dot com riches would be able to handle any financial frustration that lasted more than a few days without going into some sort of destructive depression or rage.

The greater danger is that the gulf between the richest and the rest could become transcendently grave. That is, even if we agree that a rising tide raises all ships, if the rate of the rising of the highest ships is greater than that of the lowest, they will become ever more separated. (And indeed, concentrations of wealth and poverty have increased during the Internet boom years in America.)

If Moore's Law or something like it is running the show, the scale of the separation could become astonishing. This is where my Terror resides, in considering the ultimate outcome of the increasing divide between the ultra-rich and the merely better off.

With the technologies that exist today, the wealthy and the rest aren't all that different; both bleed when pricked, for the classic example. But with the technology of the next twenty or thirty years they might become quite different indeed. Will the ultra-rich and the rest even be recognizable as the same species by the middle of the new century?

The possibilities that they will become essentially different species are so obvious and so terrifying that there is almost a banality in stating them. The rich could have their children made genetically more intelligent, beautiful, and joyous. Perhaps they could even be genetically disposed to have a superior capacity for empathy, but only to other people who meet some narrow range of criteria. Even stating these things seems beneath me, as if I were writing pulp science fiction, and yet the logic of the possibility is inescapable.

Let's explore just one possibility, for the sake of argument. One day the richest among us could turn nearly immortal, becoming virtual Gods to the rest of us. (An apparent lack of aging in both cell cultures and in whole organisms has been demonstrated in the laboratory.)

Let's not focus here on the fundamental questions of near immortality: whether it is moral or even desirable, or where one would find room if immortals insisted on continuing to have children. Let's instead focus on the question of whether immortality is likely to be expensive.

My guess is that immortality will be cheap if information technology gets much better, and expensive if software remains as crummy as it is.

I suspect that the hardware/software dichotomy will reappear in biotechnology, and indeed in other 21st century technologies. You can think of biotechnology as an attempt to make flesh into a computer, in the sense that biotechnology hopes to manage the processes of biology in ever greater detail, leading at some far horizon to perfect control. Likewise, nanotechnology hopes to do the same thing for materials science. If the body, and the material world at large become more manipulatable, more like a computer's memory, then the limiting factor will be the quality of the software that governs the manipulation.

Even though it's possible to program a computer to do virtually anything, we all know that's really not a sufficient description of computers. As I argued above: Getting computers to perform specific tasks of significant complexity in a reliable but modifiable way, without crashes or security breaches, is essentially impossible. We can only approximate this goal, and only at great expense.

Likewise, one can hypothetically program DNA to make virtually any modification in a living thing, and yet designing a particular modification and vetting it thoroughly will likely remain immensely difficult. (And, as I argued above, that might be one reason why biological evolution has never found a way to be anything speed other than very slow.) Similarly, one can hypothetically use nanotechnology to make matter do almost anything conceivable, but it will probably turn out to be much harder than we now imagine to get it do any particular thing of complexity without disturbing side effects. Scenarios that predict that biotechnology and nanotechnology will be able to quickly and cheaply create startling new things under the sun also must imagine that computers will become semi-autonomous, superintelligent, virtuoso engineers. But computers will do no such thing if the last half century of progress in software can serve as a predictor of the next half century.

In other words, bad software will make biological hacks like near-immortality expensive instead of cheap in the future. Even if everything else gets cheaper, the information technology side of the effort will get more expensive.

Cheap near-immortality for everyone is a self-limiting proposition. There isn't enough room to accommodate such an adventure. Also, roughly speaking, if immortality was to become cheap, so would the horrific biological weapons of Bill's scenario. On the other hand, expensive near immortality is something the world could absorb, at least for a good long while, because there would be fewer people involved. Maybe they could even keep the effort quiet.

So, here is the irony. The very features of computers which drive us crazy today, and keep so many of us gainfully employed, are the best insurance our species has for long term survival as we explore the far reaches of technological possibility. On the other hand, those same annoying qualities are what could make the 21st century into a madhouse scripted by the fantasies and desperate aspirations of the super-rich.

Conclusion

I share the belief of my cybernetic totalist colleagues that there will be huge and sudden changes in the near future brought about by technology. The difference is that I believe that whatever happens will be the responsibility of individual people who do specific things. I think that treating technology as if it were autonomous is the ultimate self-fulfilling prophecy. There is no difference between machine autonomy and the abdication of human responsibility.

Let's take the ""nanobots take over"" scenario. It seems to me that the most likely scenarios involve either:

a) Super-nanobots everywhere that run old software- linux, say. This might be interesting. Good video games will be available, anyway.

b) Super-nanobots that evolve as fast as natural nanobots- so don't do much for millions of years.

c) Super-nanobots that do new things soon, but are dependent on humans. In all these cases humans will be in control, for better or for worse.

So, therefore, I'll worry about the future of human culture more than I'll worry about the gadgets. And what worries me about the ""Young Turk"" cultural temperament seen in cybernetic totalists is that they seem to not have been educated in the tradition of scientific skepticism. I understand why they are intoxicated. There IS a compelling simple logic behind their thinking and elegance in thought is infectious.

There is a real chance that evolutionary psychology, artificial intelligence, Moore's Law fetishizing, and the rest of the package, will catch on in a big way, as big as Freud or Marx did in their times. Or bigger, since these ideas might end up essentially built into the software that runs our society and our lives. If that happens, the ideology of cybernetic totalist intellectuals will be amplified from novelty into a force that could cause suffering for millions of people.

The greatest crime of Marxism wasn't simply that much of what it claimed was false, but that it claimed to be the sole and utterly complete path to understanding life and reality. Cybernetic eschatology shares with some of history's worst ideologies a doctrine of historical predestination. There is nothing more gray, stultifying, or dreary than a life lived inside the confines of a theory. Let us hope that the cybernetic totalists learn humility before their day in the sun arrives.

,,Kerry Mitchell,,"In <em>The Fractal Art Manifesto</em>, Kerry Mitchell attempts to define fractal rt, rather than a computerized art without human input, as an expressive and creative artistic endeavor.",,EN,,,"<a href=""https://www.fractalus.com/info/manifesto.htm"">https://www.fractalus.com/info/manifesto.htm</a>","Fractal Art, Two dimensional visual art","As a genre, Fractal Art (FA) has been around for approximately 15-20 years. Its first major public display may be considered to be an article about the Mandelbrot Set published in ""Scientific American"" in 1985. Since then, many advances have been made, both in fractal rendering capabilities and in the understanding of fractal geometry. Perhaps now is an opportune time to make a defining statement about what is (and what is not) Fractal Art. 
    Fractal Art is a genre concerned with fractals—shapes or sets characterized by self affinity (small portions of the image resemble the overall shape) and an infinite amount of detail, at all scales. Fractals are typically created on a digital computer, using an iterative numerical process. Lately, images that are not technically fractals, but that share the same basic generating technique and environment, have been welcomed into the FA world. 
    Fractal Art is a subclass of two dimensional visual art, and is in many respects similar to photography—another art form which was greeted by skepticism upon its arrival. Fractal images typically are manifested as prints, bringing Fractal Artists into the company of painters, photographers, and printmakers. Fractals exist natively as electronic images. This is a format that traditional visual artists are quickly embracing, bringing them into FA's digital realm. 
    Generating fractals can be an artistic endeavor, a mathematical pursuit, or just a soothing diversion. However, FA is clearly distinguished from other digital activities by what it is, and by what it is not. 
 
Fractal Art is not:

 	Computer(ized) Art, in the sense that the computer does all the work. The work is executed on a computer, but only at the direction of the artist. Turn a computer on and leave it alone for an hour. When you come back, no art will have been generated.
 	Random, in the sense of stochastic, or lacking any rules. Being based on mathematics, fractal rendering is the essence of determinism. Apply the same image generation steps, and the same result will follow. Slight changes in process usually lead to slight changes in product, making FA an activity which can be learned, not a haphazard process of pushing buttons and turning knobs.
 	Random, in the sense of unpredictable. Fractal Art, like any new pursuit, will have aspects unknown to the novice, but familiar to the master. Through experience and education, the techniques of FA can be learned. As in painting or chess, the essentials are quickly grasped, although they can take a lifetime to fully understand and control. Over time, the joy of serendipitous discovery is replaced by the joy of self-determined creation.
 	Something that anyone with a computer can do well. Anyone can pick up a camera and take a snapshot. However, not just anyone can be an Ansel Adams or an Annie Liebovitz. Anyone can take brush in hand and paint. However, not just anyone can be a Georgia O'Keeffe or a Pablo Picasso. Indeed, anyone with a computer can create fractal images, but not just anyone will excel at creating Fractal Art.

Fractal Art is:

 	Expressive. Through a painter's colors, a photographer's use of light and shadow, or a dancer's movements, artists learn to express and evoke all manner of ideas and emotions. Fractal Artists are no less capable of using their medium as a similarly expressive language, as they are equipped with all the essential tools of the traditional visual artist.
 	Creative. The final fractal image must be created, just as the photograph or the painting. It can be created as a representational work, and abstraction of the basic fractal form, or as a nonrepresentational piece. The Fractal Artist begins with a blank ""canvas"", and creates an image, bringing together the same basic elements of color, composition, balance, etc., used by the traditional visual artist.
 	Requiring of input, effort, and intelligence. The Fractal Artist must direct the assembly of the calculation formulas, mappings, coloring schemes, palettes, and their requisite parameters. Each and every element can and will be tweaked, adjusted, aligned, and re-tweaked in the effort to find the right combination. The freedom to manipulate all these facets of a fractal image brings with it the obligation to understand their use and their effects. This understanding requires intelligence and thoughtfulness from the Artist.",<em>The Fractal Art Manifesto</em>,,,2014-07-20T19:45:25+00:00,9,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/9,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=36,36,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T14:40:17+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Digital Art, Fractal Art",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/36

Importantly, Griffin hails dissimulation as the foundation of digital imaging here, underscoring the notion that the computer's content is completely malleable.",,EN,The New York Times,,"<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/1121griffin.html"">http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/1121griffin.html</a>","Digital Art, Composition","A formulation by Marshall McLuhan that has become axiomatic to me is that the content of any new medium is an older medium.
A corollary to this is the notion that it takes some time before the true nature of the new medium is understood, both in terms of its social consequences and its proper application -- that is, until one that takes advantage of its true aesthetic potential.

Presumably, it is the serious artist, more specifically the ""avant garde"" artist who is the first to recognize the intrinsic nature of a new medium. In this schema, the content of film, for example, was the novel, but it took an Eisenstien to understand what was filmic about film. This seems to work pretty well for most technologies -- the content of the car (an extension of the foot) is the horse-drawn buggy, the content of the telegraph (an extension of the voice) is print, the content of video (an extension of the eye) is film, etc.

What, then, is the content of the computer? Part of the problem, of course, is how you define computer. In the case of the earliest electronic computers, as with the abacus, the content of computers was, well, computing, as in arithmetic and mathematical calculations. But today's computers, even the humble little box that sits in front of you, is positively omnivorous when it comes to content. What's more, each year it gets not only hungrier but better at assimilating what is already part of the diet.

I am an artist who produces primarily two-dimensional works, ranging from paintings to drawings to photos, by themselves and in combination. So for me, the content of the computer is all two-dimensional media -- in other words, everything I do. Personally, this has had the effect of producing an emotional toggle between giddy excitement and the vertigo of over-choice.

On the excitement side, there is a definite sense of frontier. Though it may not seem like it, digital imaging is freshly out of the womb, as newborn as photography was in the 1830s. Much of the hardware is still embryonic; for example the digital camera. (I won't buy one until they come up with something reasonably priced that will capture 10 million pixel color images in available light, hand held. So there.)

In addition, the theoretical, aesthetic and philosophical dimensions of the medium are still unclear. This makes it a bracing area of investigation for the fine artist, who characteristically develops work outside normal market demands.

I am the first to admit that this technology is powerfully seductive. (With my students and colleagues I habitually refer to the whole subject as ""digitalia."") When I first encountered Adobe Photoshop on the Mac, I knew I'd found the darkroom tool I'd been looking for all my life. After working with it and other programs for some time, it was hard to imagine ever not doing this, as if I'd found some forgotten wings that were there all along.

Nonetheless, I object to the soaring technophilia evidenced by the extravagant hype for All Things Digital. Some of it is harmlessly silly. For example, I heard some cyber-yuppie on MSNBC the other night refer to sexier looking computers as a ""paradigm shift.""

On a more ominous side, I sense a mass psychosis afoot: people worked up into a lather envisioning a future Brave New World filled with boys and their incredible toys. What's distressing to me is blind embrace of thingness at the expense of any kind of interiority. Particularly irritating is the gleeful acceptance of the notion of consciousness in silicon.

Why do people think that? No matter how subtly a machine mimics a conscious being, it's as dead as a doornail. My chess program beats me almost every time, but it doesn't know it, and certainly doesn't experience the joy of trouncing my sorry butt.

In the much-heralded future of techno-guys, if you elicit an ""ooooh"" from the beautiful cyber-device lying next to you as you touch its g-spot, do you really imagine it's for anybody but you? Well, perhaps that's the appeal.

You'd expect this kind of stuff from the pages of Wired magazine, but silicon consciousness gets support from some heavyweight intellectuals, like the philosopher Daniel Dennett. Most of the time this guy sounds like the towel boy for hard science, but he goes further with pontifications for mechanistic orthodoxy that most scientists themselves wouldn't presume. His rants on this issue amount to officious reductionism and technophilia masquerading as science and philosophy, and a stubborn confusion of model and reality.

While all this may seem somewhat far afield, I felt I had to position myself relative to the current buzz to avoid any misunderstanding when I assert that this technology is, in the McLuhan-esque sense, an extension of the human nervous system and brain and that the content of today's computer is the mental process. Though like all technological extensions, it is utterly a thing, a tool, these tools historically have had a profound effect on us, from radically altering our psychologies (McLuhan refers to ""sense ratios"") to changing the very structure of society. And all technologies before the computer were extensions of something humbler than the brain.

When students ask me what can be done with digital imaging, I tell them -- quite without fear of exaggeration -- that literally anything they can imagine (within the constraints of two dimensions) can be realized with our existing software, and that they have at their disposal a magic paintbrush that responds to their every creative whim. This, of course, is at once liberating and paralyzing, a fact that pushes some of them into a state of terminal geekhood, stuck in a myopic thrall of the tool itself. Clearly, this brush has teeth.

One of the most salient features of working digitally is the conflation of all the different forms of imagery that are fed into the computer. Photo, painting, video, drawing, film, direct scanning -- all these become a kind of uniform fodder for manipulation.

Besides the obvious and oft-cited havoc this wreaks on the veracity of any photographic ""record"" that has had the misfortune of making its way into a computer, this affects the artist in a way that is perhaps not immediately apparent. I'm referring to the characteristic look that images originally created in other media possess, a kind of base-level syntax that is almost felt rather than seen.

Consider, for example, the difference between film and video. Irrespective of content, these two media are polar opposites in terms of their feel. Compared with unmediated perceptions of the world, film buffers and aestheticizes vision. Video, on the other hand, seems more real than real, harsher somehow than unmediated visual perception. A brilliant illustration of the brutal potential of video is the ghastly sitcom sequence in the film ""Natural Born Killers"" in which the action is quite horribly enhanced by the eyeball-smushing oppression of the video image itself, a quality that holds up even when that image has been transferred to film.

So the challenge for the artist is that while the computer's content is completely malleable, one is also in the position of having to preserve, submerge or fake the signature look of another medium. Dissimulation operates constantly at the very foundation of digital imaging, and it is more intrinsic to this medium than anything previous.

For some software, like Fractal Design's Painter, fakery is the entire raison d'être. Curiously, this program falls short of simulating paintings, because the output has none of the physical characteristics of painting. What it really produces are images that resemble photographs of paintings that might have existed. And it does this well.

I tend to physicalize most of my digital imagery in one way or another, regardless of the program in which they were created. To this end, I employ various strategies. The works are usually scaled to the size of large paintings, and process is often apparent in undisguised tiling. In addition, images are buried under resin, transferred to canvas, and combined with painted passages and actual objects, not only to avoid the poster look of most digital output, but also to confound a clear reading of the media status of the image.

Many artists employ the computer to faithfully service other media through logical manipulations, but I am more attracted to the lawlessness of this new frontier. You could say that I have happily embraced the confusion, dissimulation, and subterfuge that are at the heart of working digitally.

The Creative Person’s Dilemma

Why do creative geeks (artists, musicians and writers that dwell primarily on the Internet) often live double lives? Because there isn’t a readily accessible system in place to allow a creative artist to chose to make a living from their craft without undue sacrifice, struggle and hardship. This “Jekyl and Hyde” geek spends their waking hours toiling away in an unfulfilling job while practicing their true passion at night and on the weekends.

This duality often leads to personal and professional frustration. It is incredibly unlikely that you, or me, or anyone you have ever met will become a famous musician or artist. The odds are not in our favor. But when you break down the artist’s desire into its most basic elements most of us do not desire fame, and many of us don’t desire wealth. What we desire is to be able to do the thing we are SUPPOSED to be doing (writing, drawing, whatever) all day without having to worry about what else we have to do to support ourselves and our families. We just want our passion to be our job. The reason that desire often gets confused with celebrity aspirations is that, until now, getting “discovered” and becoming rich and famous was the only sure fire way to get your art out there and into the hands of those that would appreciate it. This isn’t the case anymore.

Technology and the Internet have created a new class of creative individual. Today’s digital age artist has four things that previous generations did not. Information, Tools, Exposure and Communication.

Information: With access to the Internet, anyone can acquire almost any knowledge they seek quickly and usually for free. Art and music tutorials abound, as well as communities that offer mentorship and assistance in most creative fields.

Tools: Do you have a laptop? Then you have a full featured recording studio,  digital art studio, video production lab or creative writing and research tool. Once you have the computer you can augment it’s abilities with external recording sound cards, drawing tablets, midi controllers, video editing hardware or specialty software. The ability to layout a book, edit a movie or record an album used to be exclusive to professionals with years of training and tens of thousands of dollars worth of hardware (not to mention industry connections). Now everyone has access to this technology at an affordable price.

Exposure: I was in a band in highschool. We couldn’t afford to record a demo tape, so if we wanted anyone to hear our music (it wasn’t that good anyway) we had to play live for them. Booking shows in a small town in Texas was difficult as there was only two places to play and one was 18 and up. Getting exposure with more than a few dozen people a month was nearly impossible. Now an artist has access to hundreds of thousands of people (or millions) through outlets like YouTube, Myspace, Digg, Facebook or any other social area of the internet.

Communication: This one seems very similar to exposure, but it works to the artist’s benefit in a different way. Posting a video on Youtube of you playing your new song, and having it viewed by 100,000 people is exposure. Receiving 500 comments and emails is communication.

Why is it so important for an artist in the digital age to foster communication with his or her fans? Look at it this way: no matter how much a fan likes U2, Bono is never going to answer their email. James Hetfield is never going to add them on Myspace (his assistant might), and  the Members of Coldplay don’t follow them on Twitter. As a digital age artist you can do ALL of those things (and will if you know what’s good for you). If a fan want to know what a song is about, they can email you and expect a response. If someone wonders what software you record with, you are only one degree of separation away. True fans can bond with you, the artist, and know your work on a more personal level. You may never be a star, but you are famous to your true fans. As an artist, you can know your fans/listeners/readers on a first name basis. You can react to their feedback, give them what they want and make them a part of your creative process. For an artist to make a living from their art, communication is EVERYTHING.

A couple of scenarios that illustrate the point:

An artist has an idea for a graphic novel. She does some sketches with Photoshop using her Macbook and a Wacom drawing tablet. She posts them to an art forum where she gets critiques and makes changes based on the community feedback. Once she is comfortable with the work she sets up cheap hosting, buys a domain and installs WordPress and Comicpress to publish her work. She uses social networks to reach out to her potential audience and within 6 months 3000 people are reading her graphic novel every day. She publishes 3 pages a week and supports the site through a presale on the upcoming printed volume and advertising.
A songwriter records a full album (12 songs) using Garageband, an M-Audio USB sound card and a Midi controller (for drums, keys, strings, etc). He uploads the songs to Amazon S3 file hosting and links the Mp3‘s to a few music forums that he has been a part of for several years. The forum members post links on their blogs and word quickly spreads of his music. He also posts the full album on his website and Myspace page. He uses e-Junkie to sell the Mp3′s for $1 each. Eventually his songs (which are Creative Commons Licensed) are played on popular podcasts and internet radio stations. Eager fans flock to his site and purchase the songs, which are fairly prices and not restricted with DRM. He uses Eventful.com to decide where he should travel to play live shows. He stays in touch with his fans directly through email, his forum and comments on his blog. The fans feel a connection with the artist and support him through song sales, merchandise (physical CD’s and T-Shirts) and tickets to live performances.
These scenarios can be applied to podcasters, video bloggers, photographers, novelists, animators or pretty much any other creative profession you can think of. The barriers between a creative content producer and their potential audience are breaking down more and more every year. The best part is…

You do not have to be famous.

You don’t have to reach 100 million people to be a success. You don’t even need to reach 100,000. How many is the magic number, then? That depends on what you are creating and how much you are selling it for. Regardless of those two factors, would you agree to $100,000 would provide you a comfortable living as an artist? Considering what most artists earn from their art, you would probably be comfortable with considerably less than $100,000. Maybe $40K-$60K is your target comfort range

Assume that through your creative endeavors, which you offer up on the web through a combination of free handouts (free song a month, or free comic 3 times a week or a daily video blog) and paid content/merchandise (CD’s, T-Shirts, commissioned art, books, etc), you reach 10,000 people. We are talking 10,000 regular readers/listeners/whatever. This is NOT a very large number for the web. Popular podcasts like TWiT get 250,000+ listeners weekly and popular webcomics like PVP see daily visits between 100,000 and 200,000. So, trust me, you CAN get 10,000 casual followers. For the sake of our experiment, let’s say of your 10,000 fans, 10% are TRUE FANS.

What is a True Fan? A true fan is someone that holds your creative content near and dear. They feel a connection with your work and want to make sure you are capable of continuing to produce it. A True Fan will ACTUALLY SPEND MONEY on your content.

I’m not going into detail on how you should sell, market, or distribute your goods. There are other sources for that information. For the purpose of our experiment, I’m going to assume you are offering some kind of paid compensation opportunity to your True Fans.

So you have 1000 True Fans (for more info on the “1000 True Fans” concept, read up on Kevin Kelly), but what does that mean. A True Fan over the course of a year may spend anywhere from $50 to $100 on your creative content. That’s $50,000-100,000 annually before tax (a comfortable living for most). This is extremely simplified and your numbers may vary wildly but simplicity is key to getting the point across. With your art or music it may take 5000 True Fans spending $20 a year or 500 True Fans buying $200 original paintings, but the idea is the same. If you can truly connect with your die hard fans, those that would willingly pay for you to keep doing what you love to do, you CAN make a living from your creative output.

Again, the is extremely oversimplified and assumes you are producing quality content that people will want to digest. This experiment certainly won’t work for everyone. The flipside of the new information age is that in addition to YOU being able to get your content out to the masses, so can EVERYONE ELSE. The virtual market is flooded with wannabe webcomics, guitar heroes, videoblog divas and the like. You have to stand out through the quality of your art.

Wrapping up

We, as artists in the digital age, should not have to get permission from a record label, a book publisher or a worldwide media conglomerate to pursue our passion for a living. If our passions were customer service, management or accounting, we really wouldn’t have any problems. There are already very clear paths to achieve these goals and many people live very fulfilled lives that way. But what do those people do to relax? They listen to music, they watch movies, they read book and the look at silly comics on the internet. That’s where we come in. Artists create art so that others can enjoy it. We thrive on the creative process, and everyone else benefits from the result. Imagine how the quantity and quality of your artistic output would increase if creating it were your full time job.

Ask yourself, “Why can’t I draw comics for a living?” “Why can’t I play guitar and write songs to support myself?” “Why can’t I publish my own book, make a podcast or a produce TV show and still pay the bills?”

You absolutely can. We are the first generation of artists that DO NOT NEED PERMISSION to pursue our passion full time.","<em>The ""Digital Age"" Artist's Manifesto</em>",,,2014-07-20T19:54:13+00:00,9,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/9,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=39,39,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T14:37:57+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,Digital Art,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/39

Abstract
Auriea Harvey and Michaël Samyn are new media artists who have embraced realtime 3D game technology as their artistic medium of choice. Realtime 3D is the most remarkable new creative technology since oil on canvas. It is much too important to be wasted on computer games alone. This manifesto is a call-to-arms for creative people (including, but not limited to, video game designers and fine artists) to embrace this new medium and start realizing its enormous potential. As well as a set of guidelines that express our own ideas and ideals about using the technology.

 1.  Realtime 3D is a medium for artistic expression.
 2.  Be an author.
 3.  Create a total experience.
 4.  Embed the user in the environment.
 5.  Reject dehumanisation: tell stories.
 6.  Interactivity wants to be free.
 7.  Don’t make modern art.
 8.  Reject conceptualism.
 9.  Embrace technology.
10. Develop a punk economy.

REALTIME ART MANIFESTO

1. Realtime 3D is a medium for artistic expression.
Games are not the only things you can make with realtime 3D technology.
And modification of commercial games is not the only option accessible to artists.
Realtime 3D is the most remarkable new creative technology since oil on canvas.
It is much too important to remain in the hands of toy makers and propaganda machines.
We need to rip the technology out of their greedy claws and put them to shame by producing
the most stunning art to grace this planet so far.
(And claim the name “game” for what we do even if it is inappropriate.)
Real-time 3d interactives can be an art form unto themselves.

2. Be an author.
Do not hide behind the freedom of the user in an interactive environment to ignore your responsibility as a creator.
This only ends in confirming cliches.
Do not design in board room meetings or give marketeers creative power.
Your work needs to come from a singular vision and be driven by a personal passion.
Do not delegate direction jobs.
Be a dictator.
But collaborate with artisans more skilled than you.
Ignore the critics and the fanboys.
Make work for your audience instead.
Embrace the ambiguity that the realtime medium excells in.
Leave interpretation open where appropriate
but keep the user focused and immersed the worlds that you create.
Commercial games are conservative, both in design as in mentality.
They eschew authorship, pretending to offer the player a neutral vessel to take him or her through the virtual world.
But the refusal to author results in a mimicing of generally accepted notions, of television and other mass media.
Banality.
Reject pure commercialism.
Individual elements of many commercial games made with craft and care produce artistic effects 
but the overall product is not art.
Some commercial games have artistic moments,
but we need to go further.
Step one: drop the requirement of making a game.
The game structure of rules and competition stands in the way of expressiveness.
Interactivity wants to be free.
Gaming stands in the way of playing.
There are so many other ways of interacting in virtual environments.
We have only just begun to discover the possibilities.
Games are games.
They are ancient forms of play that have their place in our societies.
But they are by far not the only things one can do with realtime technologies.
Stop making games.
Be an author.

3. Create a total experience.
Do not render!
All elements serve the realisation of the piece as a whole.
Models, textures, sound, interaction, environment, atmosphere, 
drama, story, programming 
are all equally important.
Do not rely on static renderings.
Everything happens in real time.
The visuals as well as the logic.
Create multi-sensorial experiences.
Simulate sensorial sensations for which output hardware does not exist (yet).
Make the experience feel real
(it does not need to look real).
Do not imitate other media but develop an aesthetic style that is unique.
Make the activity that the user spends most time doing the most interesting one in the game.
It’s not about the individual elements but about the total effect of the environment.
The sum of its parts.
In the end the work is judged by the quality of authorship
and not by its individual elements.
Models, textures, sound, interaction design, environment design, atmosphere, drama, story, programming.
Together without hierarchy.
No element can be singled out. All are equally important.
Create a simulated multi-sensorial experience. Not only a picture.
Or only a game.
Or only a soundtrack.

4. Embed the user in the environment.
The user is not disembodied in virtual space
but takes the body into the experience.
The avatar is not a neutral vessel but allows the user to navigate
not only through the virtual space
but also through the narrative content.
Interaction is the link between the user and the piece.
Provide for references
(both conceptual and sensorial)
to connect the user to the environment.
Reject abstraction.
Make the user feel at home.
(and then play with his
or her
expectations
-just don’t start with alienation,
the real world is alienationg enough as it is)
Reject the body-mind duality.
The user is the center of the experience.
Think “architecture”, not “film”.
Interaction is pivotal
to “put the user in the environment”.
The user is not disembodied but is provided with a device
(similar to a diving suit or astronout’s outfit)
which allows him
or her to visit a place that would otherwise not be accessible.
You bring your body with you to this place,
or at least your memories of it.
Strictly speaking, our output media only allow for the reproduction of visuals and sound.
But real-time interaction and processing can help us to achieve simulation of touch, smell and taste as well, through visuals and sound.
In fact, force feedback already provides for a way to communicate with touch.
And the activity of fingers on the mouse or hands holding a joystick allows for physical communication.
Don’t underestimate this connection.
From the USB port to the joystick. Through the hand to the nerous system.
One network.
Soon as smell and taste can be reproduced, those media can quickly be incorporated into our technology.
The virtual place is not necessarily alien.
On the contrary:
It can deal with any subject.
References to the real world
(of nature as well as culture)
(both conceptual and sensorial)
create links between the environment and the user.
Since interaction is pivotal, these links are crucial.
Make it feel real, not necessarily look real.
Develop a unique language for the realtime 3D medium and do not fall in MacLuhan’s trap (don’t allow any old medium to become the content of the new)
Imitate life and not photography, or drawings, or comic strips or even old-school games.
Realism does not equal photo -realism!
In a multisensory medium, realism is a multisensory experience: It has to feel real.

5. Reject dehumanisation: tell stories.
Stories ground people in culture,
(and remove the alienation that causes aggression)
stimulate their imagination,
(and therefore improve the capability to change)
teach them about themselves
and connect them with each other.
Stories are a vital element of society.
Embrace non-linearity.
Let go of the idea of plot.
Realtime is non-linear.
Tell the story through interaction.
Do not use in-game movies or other non-realtime devices to tell the story.
Do not create a “drama manager”: let go of plot!
Plot is not compatible with realtime.
Think “poetry”, not “prose”.
The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle recognized six elements in Drama.
PLOT
what happens in a play, the order of events,
is only one of them.
Next to plot we have
THEME
or the main idea in the work
CHARACTER
or the personality or role played by an actor
DICTION
the choice and delivery of words
MUSIC/RHYTHM
the sound, rhythm and melody of what is being said
SPECTACLE
the visual elements of the work.
All of these can be useful in non-linear realtime experiences. Except plot.
But the realtime medium offers additional elements that easily augment or replace plot.
INTERACTIVITY
the direct influence of the viewer on the work
IMMERSION
the presence of the viewer in the work
AN AUDIENCE OF ONE
every staging of the work is done for an audience of a single person in the privacy of his
or her home.
These new elements add the viewer as an active participant to the experience.
This is not a reduction of the idea of story but an enrichment.
Realtime media allow us to tell stories that could not be told before.
Many of the mythical fantasies about art can now be made real.
Now we can step into paintings and become part of them.
Now sculptures can come alive and talk to us.
Now we walk onto the stage and take part in the action.
We can live the lives of romance characters.
Be the poet or the muse.
Do not reject stortelling in realtime because it is not straightforward.
Realtime media allow us to make ambiguity and imagination active parts of the experience.
Embrace the ambiguity:
it is enriching.
The realtime medium allows for telling stories that cannot be told in any other language.
But realtime is not suitable for linear stories: Embrace non-linearity!
Reject plot!
Realtime is a poetic technology.
Populate the virtual world with narrative elements that allow the player to make up his or her own story.
Imagination moves the story into the user’s mind.
It allows the story to penetrate the surface and take its place amongst the user’s thoughts & memories.
The bulk of your story should be told in realtime, through interaction.
Do not use in-game movies or other devices.
Do not fall back on a machine to create plot on the fly: let go of plot, plot is not compatible with realtime.
Do not squeeze the realtime medium into a linear frame.
Stories in games are not impossible or irrelevant, even if “all that matters is gameplay”.
Humans need stories and will find stories in everything.
Use this to your advantage.
Yes, “all that matters is gameplay”,
if you extend gameplay to mean all interaction in the game.
Because it is through this interaction that the realtime medium will tell its stories.
The situation is the story.
Choose your characters and environment carefully
so that the situation immediately triggers narrative associations in the mind of the user.

6. Interactivity wants to be free.
Don’t make games.
The rule-based structure and competitive elements in traditional game design stand in the way of expressiveness.
And often, ironically, rules get in the way of playfulness
(playfulness is required for an artistic experience!).
Express yourself through interactivity.
Interactivity is the one unique element of the realtime medium.
The one thing that no other medium can do better.
It should be at the center of your creation.
Interactivity design rule number one:
the thing you do most in the game, should be the thing that is most interesting to do.
i.e., If it takes a long time to walk between puzzles, the walk should be more interesting than the puzzles.

7. Don’t make modern art.
Modern art tends to be ironical, cynical, self referential, afraid of beauty, afraid of meaning
-other than the trendy discourse of the day-,
afraid of technology, anti-artistry.
Furthermore contemporary art is a marginal niche.
The audience is elsewhere.
Go to them rather then expecting them to come to the museum.
Contemporary art is a style, a genre, a format.
Think!
Do not fear beauty.
Do not fear pleasure.
Make art-games, not game-art.
Game art is just modern art
-ironical, cynical, afraid of beauty, afraid of meaning.
It abuses a technology that has already spawned an art form capable of communicating far beyond the reach of modern art.
Made by artists far superior in artistry and skills.
Game art is slave art.
Realtime media are craving your input, your visions.
Real people are starving for meaningful experiences.
And what’s more:
society needs you.
Contemporary civilisations are declining at an unsurpassed rate.
Fundamentalism.
Fascism.
Populism.
War.
Pollution.
The world is collapsing while the Artists twiddle their thumbs in the museums.
Step into the world.
Into the private worlds of individuals.
Share your vision.
Connect.
Connect.
Communicate.

8. Reject conceptualism.
Make art for people,
not for documentation.
Make art to experience
and not to read about.
Use the language of your medium to communicate all there is to know.
The user should never be required to read a description or a manual.
Don’t parody things that are better than you.
Parodies of commercial games are ridiculous if their technology, craft and artistry do not match up with the original.
Don’t settle yourself in the position of the underdog: surpass them!
Go over their heads!
Dominate them!
Show them how it’s done!
Put the artistry back in Art.
Reject conceptualism.
Make art for people, not for documentation.
Make art to experience and not art to read about.
Use the language of your work to communicate its content.
The audience should never be required to read the description.
The work should communicate all that is required to understand it.

9. Embrace technology.
Don’t be afraid of technology,
and least of all, don’t make art about this fear.
It’s futile.
Technology is not nature. Technology is not god.
It’s a thing.
Made for people by people.
Grab it. Use it.
Software is infinitely reproducable and easy to distribute.
Reject the notion of scarcity.
Embrace the abundance that the digital allows for.
The uniqueness of realtime is in the experience.
Cut out the middle man: deliver your productions directly to the users.
Do not depend on galleries, museums, festivals or publishers.
Technology-based art should not be about technology:
it should be about life, death and the human condition.
Embrace technology, make it yours!
Use machines to make art for humans, not vice versa.
Make software!
Software is infinitely reproducable
(there is no original; uniqueness is not required
-the uniqueness is in the experience)
Distribution of software is easy through the internet or portable data containers
(no elitism; no museums, galleries, or festivals; from creator to audience without mediation -and from the audience back to the creator, through the same distribution media)

10. Develop a punk economy.
Don’t shy away from competition with commercial developers.
Your work offers something that theirs does not:
originality of design,
depth of content,
alternative aesthetics.
Don’t worry about the polish too much.
Get the big picture right.
“Reduce the volume, Increase the quality and density”
(Fumito Ueda)
Make short and intense games:
think haiku, not epic.
Think poetry, not prose.
Embrace punk aesthetics.
But don’t become too dependant on government or industry funding: it is unreliable.
Sell your work directly to your audience.
And use alternative distribution methods that do not require enormous sales figures to break even.
Consider self-publishing and digital distribution.
Avoid retail and traditional games publishers.
Together they take so great a cut
that it requires you to sell hundreds of thousands of copies to make your production investment back.
Do not allow institutional or economic control of your intellectual property, ideas, technology and inventions .
Don’t depend on government support or the arts world exclusively.
Sell your games!
Communicate with your audience directly:
cut out the middle man.
Let the audience support your work.
Communicate.

The ABC of Tactical Media
By David Garcia and Geert Lovink

Tactical Media are what happens when the cheap 'do it yourself' media, made possible by the revolution in consumer electronics and expanded forms of distribution (from public access cable to the internet) are exploited by groups and individuals who feel aggrieved by or excluded from the wider culture. Tactical media do not just report events, as they are never impartial they always participate and it is this that more than anything separates them from mainstream media.

A distinctive tactical ethic and aesthetic that has emerged, which is culturally influential from MTV through to recent video work made by artists. It began as a quick and dirty aesthetic although it is just another style it (at least in its camcorder form) has come to symbolize a verite for the 90's.

Tactical media are media of crisis, criticism and opposition. This is both the source their power, (""anger is an energy"" : John Lydon), and also their limitation. their typical heroes are; the activist, Nomadic media warriors, the pranxter, the hacker,the street rapper, the camcorder kamikaze, they are the happy negatives, always in search of an enemy. But once the enemy has been named and vanquished it is the tactical practitioner whose turn it is to fall into crisis. Then (despite their achievements) its easy to mock them, with catch phrases
of the right, ""politically correct"" ""Victim culture"" etc. More
theoretically the identity politics, media critiques and theories
of representation, that became the foundation of much western tactical media are themselves in crisis. These ways of thinking are widely seen as, carping and repressive remnants of an outmoded humanism.

To believe that issues of representation are now irrelevant is to believe that the very real life chances of groups and individuals are not still crucially affected by the available images circulating in any given society.  And the fact that we no longer see the mass media as the sole and centralized source of our self definitions might make these issues more slippery but that does not make them redundant.

Tactical media a qualified form of humanism. A useful antidote to both, what Peter Lamborn Wilson described, as  ""the unopposed rule of money over human beings"". But also as an antidote to newly emerging forms of technocratic scientism which under the banner of post-humanism tend to
restrict discussions of human use and social reception.

What makes Our Media Tactical? In 'The Practice of Every Day Life' De Certueau analyzed  popular culture not as a 'domain of texts or artifacts but rather as a set of practices or operations performed on textual or text like structures'. He shifted  the emphasis from representations in their own right to the  'uses' of representations. In other words how do we as  consumers use the texts and artifacts that surround us. And the answer, he suggested, was 'tactically'. That is in far more creative and rebellious ways than had previously been imagined. He described the process of consumption as a set of tactics by which the weak make use of the strong. He characterized the rebellious user (a term he preferred to
consumer) as tactical and the presumptuous producer (in which he included authors, educators, curators and revolutionaries) as strategic. Setting up this dichotomy allowed him to produce a vocabulary of tactics rich and
complex enough to amount to a distinctive and recognizable aesthetic. An existential aesthetic. An aesthetic of Poaching, tricking, reading, speaking, strolling, shopping, desiring. Clever tricks, the hunter's cunning, maneuvers, polymorphic situations, joyful discoveries, poetic as well as warlike.

Awareness of this tactical/strategic dichotomy helped us to name a class of producers of who seem uniquely aware of the value of these temporary reversals in the flow of power. And rather than resisting these rebellions do everything in their power to amplify them. And indeed make the creation of spaces, channels and platforms for these reversals central to their practice. We dubbed their (our) work tactical media.

Tactical Media are never perfect, always in becoming,
performative and pragmatic, involved in  a continual process of questioning the premises of the channels they  work with. This requires the confidence that the content can survive intact as it travels from interface to interface. But we must never forget that hybrid media has its opposite its nemesis, the Medialen Gesamtkunstwerk. The final program for the electronic Bauhaus.

Of course it is much safer to stick to the classic rituals of the
underground and alternative scene. Bu tactical media are based on a principal of flexible response, of working with different coalitions, being able to move between the different entities in the vast media landscape without betraying their original motivations. Tactical Media may be hedonistic, or zealously euphoric. Even fashion hypes have their uses. But it is above all mobility that most characterizes the tactical
practitioner. The desire and capability to combine or jump from one media to another creating a continuous supply of mutants and hybrids. To cross boarders, connecting and re-wiring a variety of disciplines and always taking full advantage of the free spaces in the media that are continually appearing because of the pace of technological change and regulatory uncertainty.

Although tactical media include alternative media,  we are not
restricted to that category. In fact we introduced the term tactical to disrupt and take us beyond the rigid dichotomies that have restricted thinking in this area, for so long,  dichotomies such as amateur Vs professional, alternative Vs mainstream. Even private Vs public.

Our hybrid forms are always provisional. What counts are the temporary connections you are able to make. Here and now, Not some vaporware promised for the future. But what we can do on the spot with the media we have access to. Here in Amsterdam we have access to local TV, digital cities and fortresses of new and old media. In other places they might
have theater, street demonstrations, experimental film, literature, photography.

Tactical media's mobility connects it to a wider movement of
migrant culture. Espousedby the proponents of what Nie
Ascherson described as the stimulating pseudo science of
Nomadism. 'The human race say its exponants are entering a new epoch of movement and migration. The subjects of history once the settled farmers and citizens, have become the migrants,the refugees the gastarbeiters, the asylum seekers, the urban homeless.'

An exemplery example of the tactical can be seen in the work of the Polish artist Krzystof Wodiczko who 'perceives how the
hordes of the displaced that now occupy the public space of cities squares,  parks or railway station concourses which were once designed by a triumphant middle class to celebrate the conquest of its new political rights and economic liberties. Wodiczko thinks that these  occupied spaces form new agoras. which should be used for statements. 'The artist', he says, 'needs to learn how to operate as a nomadic sophist in a migrant polis.'

Like other migrant media tactitions Wodiczko has studied the
techniques by which the weak become stronger than the opressors by scatering , by becoming centreless, by moving fast across the physical or media and virtual landscapes. 'The hunted mustdiscover the ways become the hunter.'

But capital is also radically deterritorialized. This is why we like being based in a building like De Waag, an old fortress in the center of Amsterdam. We happily accept the paradox of *centers* of tactical media. As well as castles in the air, we need fortresses of bricks and mortar, to resist a world of unconstrained nomadic capital. Spaces to plan not just improvise and the possibility of capitalizing on
acquired advantages, has always been the preserve of 'strategic' media. As flexible media tacticians, who are not afraid of power, we are happy to adopt this approach ourselves.

Every few years we do a Next 5 Minutes conference on tactical media from around the world. Finally we have a base (De Waag) from which we hope to consolidate and build for the longer term. We see this building as a place to plan regular events and meetings, including coming The Next 5 Minutes. We see the coming The Next 5 Minutes (in january 1999), and
discussions leading up to it, as part of a movement to create an antidote to what Peter Lamborn Wilson described, as 'the unopposed rule of money over human beings.'

In the beginning was the Ad. The Ad was brought to the consumer by the Advertiser. Desire, self worth, self image, ambition, hope; all find their genesis in the Ad. Through the Ad and the intent of the Advertiser we form our ideas and learn the myths that make us into what we are as a people. That this method of self definition displaced the earlier methods is beyond debate. It is now clear that the Ad holds the most esteemed position in our cosmology.
Advertising suffuses all corners of our waking lives; it so permeates our consciousness that even our dreams are often indistinguishable from a rapid succession of TV commercials. 

Different forms of media serve the Ad as primary conduits to the people. Entirely new media have been invented solely to streamline the process of bringing the Ad to the people. 

Old fashioned notions about art, science and spirituality being the peak achievements and the noblest goals of the spirit of man have been dashed on the crystalline shores of Acquisition; the holy pursuit of consumer goods. All old forms and philosophies have been cleverly co-opted and re""spun"" as marketing strategies and consumer campaigns by the new shamans, the Ad men. 

Spiritualism, literature and the physical arts: painting, sculpture, music and dance are by and large produced, packaged and consumed in the same fashion as a new car. Product contents, dictated by trends in hipness, contain a half-life matching the producers calender for being supplanted by newer models. 

Product placement in television and film have overtaken story line, character development and other dated strategies in importance in the agendas of the filmmakers. The directors commanding the biggest budgets have more often than not cut their teeth on TV Ads & music videos. 

Artists are judged and rewarded on the basis of their relative standing in the ongoing commodification of art objects. Bowing to fashion and the vagaries of gallery culture, these creators attempt to manufacture collectible baubles and contemporary or ""period"" objects that will successfully penetrate the collectors market. The most successful artists are those who can most successfully sell their art. With increasing frequency they apprentice to the Advertisers; no longer needing to falsely maintain the distinction between ""Fine"" & ""Commercial"" art. 

And so we see, the Ad defines our world, creating both the focus on ""image"" and the culture of consumption that ultimately attract and inspire all individuals desirous of communicating to their fellow man in a profound fashion. It is clear that He who controls the Ad speaks with the voice of our Age. 

You can switch off/smash/shoot/hack or in other ways avoid Television, Computers and Radio. You are not compelled to buy magazines or subscribe to newspapers. You can sic your rotweiler on door to door salesman. Of all the types of media used to disseminate the Ad there is only one which is entirely inescapable to all but the bedridden shut-in or the Thoreauian misanthrope. We speak, of course of the Billboard. Along with its lesser cousins, advertising posters and ""bullet"" outdoor graphics, the Billboard is ubiquitous and inescapable to anyone who moves through our world. Everyone knows the Billboard; the Billboard is in everyones mind. 

For these reasons the Billboard Liberation Front states emphatically and for all time herein that to Advertise is to Exist. To Exist is to Advertise. Our ultimate goal is nothing short of a personal and singular Billboard for each citizen. Until that glorious day for global communications when every man, woman and child can scream at or sing to the world in 100Pt. type from their very own rooftop; until that day we will continue to do all in our power to encourage the masses to use any means possible to commandeer the existing media and to alter it to their own design. 

Each time you change the Advertising message in your own mind, whether you climb up onto the board and physically change the original copy and graphics or not, each time you improve the message, you enter in to the High Priesthood of Advertisers.

By proposing a 'network of castles,' Wilson theorizes the production of autonomous digital spaces that might foment the tactical media ethic and aesthetic.",,EN,"First distributed via <a href=""http://www.nettime.com"">www.nettime.com</a>",,"<a href=""http://subsol.c3.hu/subsol_2/contributors2/plwilsontext.html"">http://subsol.c3.hu/subsol_2/contributors2/plwilsontext.html</a>","Tactical Media, Internet Freedom","RESPONSE TO THE TACTICAL MEDIA MANIFESTO: 
A NETWORK OF CASTLES

Peter Lamborn Wilson 


Tactical media, then, would be a kind of filth--an organic process--as compared with the ideological cleanliness of strategic media (the ""author"").

Do we need a defense of filth, or a theory of filth--as fertility, as pleasure, as relaxation from the rigidities of ""Civilization""? Not nostalgia for the mud, but the mud itself ? Or would such theorizing simply become another kind of tidying-up process--an erasure of its own theoretical object?

The tactical problem consists of the need (or desire) to stay ahead of representation --not just to escape it, but to attain through mobilization a relative invulnerability from to representation. And the problematic aspect of the problem is that all media--even tactical media--deal in representation.

Thus one can follow the trajectory of a given tactical medium, through ever greater representation, towards the fate of being subsumed into some strategy. And the fatal black hole toward which so many of these trajectories vanish is Capital--of course.

Everything is a process of being cleaned up. To preserve its autonomy the tactical medium wants to remain dirty--it can never let itself be surrounded and cleared by strategy, by ideology. It must stay out ahead, drifting before all possible waves, uncertain even of its own trajectory.

By another paradox, this uncertainty itself becomes a ""principle."" It comes to occupy the space of a strategy--and thus to define a strategic space. No ""authors"" need to be implicated. A messy organic process--involving both reason and unreason--not imposed or categorical--emergent. Shape-shifting. Dangerous and plagued by failures. But not aimless or undirected. In effect--strategic.

Media as technologies (""machines"") are perfect mirror-representations of the totality that produces them (or vice-versa). The internet, for example, mirrors not only its military origin but also its affinity with Capital. Like globalism, it breaks through borders--it is a ""chaos,"" like Capital (which seeks the Strange Attractor of the numisphere, where the numinous and the numismatic are one and eternal). One might even speak of ""nomadic"" features (""migratory capital""). Like Capital, the Net is drawn toward virtuality, cognitive prosthesis, disembodiment. But (the ""vice versa"" process) media tend simultaneously toward the production of the totality:--a complex multi-feedback relation.

In one sense, tactical media would then have to engage in the destruction and/or subversion (""substruction"") of this complex--driving a wedge between the machine and the totality. Such action would imply that the totality is far from total, that there will be interruptions along the feedback lines, breaks in ""service""--missing zones, and zones of resistance.

Ad-hoc, constantly mutating, determinedly empirical, at this point tactics begin to coalesce into a strategy (""spontaneous ordering""). Because this strategy has no ""author"" (and is not ideologically driven) each tactical medium--each tactician as medium--will be able to seek direction from it without losing autonomy to it. Thus the complex interplay between tactic and strategy is one of mutual validation or ""co-emergence.""

At this point, the metaphor of the castle--introduced by the Manifesto--takes on an added luster, or perhaps a baleful gleam. The Nizari Ismailis (the so-called ""Assassins"") structured their polity around a network of remote castles, most of which were inaccessible to every medieval military tactic--even prolonged siege, since they were supplied with their own gardens and water. Each high castle typically protected a fertile valley and was therefore self-sufficient--but full communication and even economic activity could take place within the network thanks to the ""porosity"" of medieval borders. And thanks to the policy of assassination or threatened assassinations, kings and religious authorities hesitated to interfere. This went on for centuries.

Some years ago I remarked that the Nizari model for utopia had been rendered impossible by modern technologies of war and communication. Perhaps it would be interesting as a thought-experiment to see if this negative judgment still holds true. From a military viewpoint of course it does--the ""isolated castle"" (or commune or the like) can still be eliminated by the push of a button. But ""the military"" must have a reason for such action. Since ""assassination"" is an absurdity (e.g. the Unabomber)--and even ""militance"" must be re-defined--there may be no immediately apparent reason for the military to suppress a given ""autonomous zone.""

The question of communication technology is trivial by comparison, but interesting. The Net as a ""military"" structure is ""accessible to all,"" and even as Capital absorbs the Net these tactical areas of indeterminacy persist--the same holds true for all ""intimate"" or tactical media. Thus the ""network of castles"" becomes possible--but the real question is whether the castle itself is possible.

Like any institution the castle will exist in part as a representation of itself in media. The Assassins' castles were rooted partly in the imaginaire, in the image that pervaded medieval media (text, work-of-mouth, legend), in the image of mysterious inaccessibility and danger. The Mongols finally destroyed Alamut not by direct assault but by demoralizing it with an even more fearsome image (pyramids of skulls from China to Hungary, etc.). But at its height of power, Alamut could dispense even with assassination, since the image alone sufficed to ward off all military and political attention.

Under the regime of global neo-liberalization or pan-capitalism that triumphed in 1989, the nation-states of the world have begun to ""privatize"" all social functions for the collection of taxes for the support of military and police force, and the use of that force in the interests of Capital. The ""natural law of the free market,"" however, clashes with the remnants of social ideology embedded in such structures as the UN, the EU, or even the ""old"" liberal or conservative regimes of certain states. Politics in such situations becomes a matter cognitive dissonance.

This is exacerbated by the appearance of ""new media"" which mirror the global totality but also enhance the cognitive dissonance (negative feedback, ""noise"") inherent in the representations of the totality. Capital seems to have a logic of its own--the tendency of money to define all human relations, if you will--but in truth neither capitalists nor politicians can really penetrate this logic or understand its direction--much less control it. Huge conceptual gaps open in the structure of the ""totality."" The question remains: are these gaps strategic?

The gaps cut across sedimentary layers of actuality, and the gaps themselves tend to shift position, change shape, open and close. Geography as well as the virtual space of the image, space as well as time constitute the mutating forms of these potential tactical regions. some will be zones of depletion, in which all power has been shut off (there are rumors of strange tribes around Chernobyl...); others will be accidental autonomous zones which might involve classes, groups (""refugees"") or specific areas. Some will be liberratd zones (Chiapas), others will be deliberate seams. Some will be ""unseen,"" others will enter into representation. In the midst of such fluidity, there must emerge some islands or rocks. Castles will be occupied in the confusion, and later there will be no military advantage in destroying them. The castles will not be defendable, but they will be irrelevant, unassimilable--to ""remote"" (even in the middle of ancient cities)--apparently pointless. An air of shabby eccentricity might be useful here.

Another reason for Alamut's success was that any king who allowed it to exist could consider the possibility of a secret alliance, whereby money could be used to purchase immunity from the dagger--or perhaps even a contract on some other king--or most interesting of all, access to the secret sciences (astronomy, engineering and hydraulics, political philosophy, medicine, yogic techniques, etc.) of the Nizari observatories and libraries. In modern terms we might say that capitalists and politicians are so confused and ignorant about new media (far more so than the average artist or 14-year-old) that large sums of money are currently being spent on ""secret sciences."" Out of the conflict between Capital and State over monopolies of representation, gaps can be produced--and made big enough to contain castles.

All this of course remains on the level of tactics. But the construction of a ""network of castles"" would constitute not only (in itself) a pleasurable act of autonomy and self-organization, but also a ""strategic"" structure, or rather an organic and embodied complexity out of which a strategic dimension might well emerge.

I was inspired by some of those manifestos of other artists and thought I might give it a try.

Art Manifesto

1. Art is a language, it must be written in words. The reason there are no more art movements is because there are no more languages. Post Modernism destroyed them all.

Languages are born out of pattern, recognition, reproduction, and memory. 

Without memory we can never improve, change, evolve, grow, or sustain what we value.

2. Time is a natural resource. It is an artist’s air. We sell our air just to survive and then everybody wonders why all the artists are holding their breath. 

3. Art is freedom. It needs freedom like plants need water and sunlight. It can exist with less freedom as a deformed and stunted plant continues to exist. 

4. Freedom lives in two dimensions; one in the real world, and the other in our minds. One is the unlocking of a gate, and the other is knowing the gate is unlocked.

5. Most of the world’s greatest masterpieces were never created. They fail to escape the mind who first conceives them.

6. Civilization can survive without Art, it has and still does in many places. It isn’t society but the soul that falls apart without it.

7. Art can and does serve the wealthy and powerful. Only we decide when it deserves better.

8. A true Artist is open minded to everything, he listens then interprets accordingly.

9. There is such a thing as bad art, it is exists in the absence of thought, inspiration, imagination and vision. Good Artists are aware of these forces, great Artists possess them, and masters weald them.

Good art touches something that others try to access through it. It is the marriage of the intellect and the emotions.

10. An Artist must farm their imagination to strengthen their creativity. One can gain or lose creative power depending on one’s habits.

11. A strong imagination is limitless, it feels like an ocean of possibilities. The artist’s conception is the wind that carves and molds these troubled water.

12. An artist’s tools disappear every time he steps into a new media. We begin using them without knowing how they work let alone that they exist. With every new creation the tools become a little clearer. With every new media, our old tools change.

13. an Artist knows when art is being truthful. Unauthentic art exudes a lofting, almost undetected- funny smell.

14. Living in constant inspiration is the goal of any Artist lucky enough to have experienced it before.

15. Artists cannot fit into social conventions- when they do, they cease being Artists. This transition is reversible.

16. A true Artist is not economical, he pours into his work every detail he hopes others will pull out of it. There are no short cuts to a master piece. 

17. obfuscation is not a style. It fills the white space within a young Artist’s work, and helps distract the teacher from seeing these empty spaces.

18. Artists don’t see what exists, we bring what doesn’t yet exist… into this world.",<em>Art Manifesto</em>,,,2014-07-22T02:52:10+00:00,9,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/9,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=45,45,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T14:33:52+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Digital Art, Tactical Media",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/45

A group of journalists, bloggers, professionals and creators want to express their firm opposition to the inclusion in a Draft Law of some changes to Spanish laws restricting the freedoms of expression, information and access to culture on the Internet. They also declare that:

1.- Copyright should not be placed above citizens’ fundamental rights to privacy, security, presumption of innocence, effective judicial protection and freedom of expression.

2.- Suspension of fundamental rights is and must remain an exclusive competence of judges. This blueprint, contrary to the provisions of Article 20.5 of the Spanish Constitution, places in the hands of the executive the power to keep Spanish citizens from accessing certain websites.

3.- The proposed laws would create legal uncertainty across Spanish IT companies, damaging one of the few areas of development and future of our economy, hindering the creation of startups, introducing barriers to competition and slowing down its international projection.

4.- The proposed laws threaten creativity and hinder cultural development. The Internet and new technologies have democratized the creation and publication of all types of content, which no longer depends on an old small industry but on multiple and different sources.

5.- Authors, like all workers, are entitled to live out of their creative ideas, business models and activities linked to their creations. Trying to hold an obsolete industry with legislative changes is neither fair nor realistic. If their business model was based on controlling copies of any creation and this is not possible any more on the Internet, they should look for a new business model.

6.- We believe that cultural industries need modern, effective, credible and affordable alternatives to survive. They also need to adapt to new social practices.

7.- The Internet should be free and not have any interference from groups that seek to perpetuate obsolete business models and stop the free flow of human knowledge.

8.- We ask the Government to guarantee net neutrality in Spain, as it will act as a framework in which a sustainable economy may develop.

9.- We propose a real reform of intellectual property rights in order to ensure a society of knowledge, promote the public domain and limit abuses from copyright organizations.

10.- In a democracy, laws and their amendments should only be adopted after a timely public debate and consultation with all involved parties. Legislative changes affecting fundamental rights can only be made in a Constitutional law.

wearable computing, retinal displays, distributed wireless mesh networks and semantic web standards are the foundation of an outside internet. The space, the social network, thinking tools and the network interface in the same field of view. The boundaries between what is interior and what is exterior intersecting tangibly in front of your eyes.

It has been said that 80 percent of human knowledge has a spa­tial aspect – yet at the same time the Internet has largely ignored this. We are human beings; embedded in and subservient to the spatial and temporal limitations of a physical reality. The Internet should soon be able to reflect these realities better.

life flows into inanimate objects

everything in the world, animate and inanimate, abstract and con­crete, has thoughts attached

background

The headmap manifesto is a sequence of text fragments dealing with the social and cultural implications of location aware devices.

Headmap argues a move from the ‘inside’ view that developed after the failure of the space programme, the closure of the fron­tiers, the rise of television, early computing, interiorised simulation and drug culture..

..towards an ‘outside’ view – a recolonisation of the real world, computers becoming invisible, mobile, networked and location aware, the real world augmented rather than simulated. People finding more outside than inside and developing sophisticated information based relationships to exterior spaces, computer games moving outside, technologies facilitating the tagging and annotating of spaces, places, people, animals and things, the emergence of new forms of spontaneous externalised real social interaction, constructs drawn from dreams and myth shape the outside more tangibly than ever before.

New forms of collective, network organised dissent are emerging. Collectively constructive rather than oppositional. Now capable of augmenting, reorganising, and colonising real spaces without altering what is already there or notifying those being colonised.

The internet has already started leaking into the real world. Head­map argues that when it gets trully loose the world will be new again.

the geomesh

a geomesh

Presence on a local wireless network is becoming a usable indica­tor of spatial proximity (for machines and people). GPS systems can supplement this less formal geocentric interaction by provid­ing accurate information that can be disseminated through the local network (but they don’t necessarily need to).

wireless nodes can broadcast RDF feeds containing location infor­mation [cf consume]

wireless heavy conferences are early forms of working social geo­meshes, the location of participants is constrained and a wireless communication channel is open. The geosocial organising prin­ciple is the intersection of the conference (representing both place and common interest) and wireless network, if you’re associated at the conference and on the network you’re most likely connected spatially, socially and ontologically.

new world

The linking of a location aware device (e.g. something with GPS funtionality), with a handheld com­puter (e.g. an IPAQ or a handspring) together with a mobile, wireless, internet connection, creates a significant new mass market computing platform which begins to make possible:

• leaving notes, demarcating spaces, and marking places, but leaving no external visible sign of having done so.

• anything left can be made visible to all, or to user specified indi­viduals and groups.

• information (textual, audible or visual) can be bound to specific places.

• an alternative or supplement to permanent visual signifiers (e.g. signs, clothing, advertising).

• individuals can utilise new forms of community based on aug­mented awareness of their proximity to places of interest and each other..

..spontaneous extended community defined by both common interest and proximity.

• tracking the migration and movement patterns of people, ani­mals and things.

• places can have histories ‘attached’ to them (i.e. the collection of notes left at a given place sorted according to when they were left).

• inanimate objects can become more animate (if you know where

 

a tree is and you know when someone is walking past it you could make it burst into song).

..there are even Integrated MicroElectrical Mechanical Systems (IMEMS) techniques which are making possible the fabrication of chips with onboard digital compasses, and, more interestingly, gyroscopes and accelerometers (which means that the kind of inertial navigation systems used to navigate nuclear submarines without breaking radio silence can be embedded inside your cell phone)

Location aware devices.

street lights functioning as wireless mesh network nodes

“As cable companies continue to increase the cost of broadband service, and as telcom monopolies are strengthened by changes in FCC policy, it is now absolutely clear what the broadband endgame will be in the US: wireless. Think of a city where every single street light is a node in a mesh (for an example, see meshnetworks), and thus where the cloud of the internet sits on the street like the fog in San Francisco. For almost nothing, cities could provide IP light, as cities provide street lights. Neutral, end-to-end, fast, and cheap.”

location aware devices

location aware, networked, mobile devices make pos­sible invisible notes attached to spaces, places, people and things.

the headmap manifesto articulates the social implications of loca­tion aware devices.

It manifests a world in which computer games move outside and get subversive.

Sex and even love are easier to find.

Real space can be marked and demarcated invisibly.

..what was once the sole preserve of builders, architects and engi­neers falls into the hands of everyone: the ability to shape and organise the real world and the real space.

Real borders, boundaries and space become plastic and male­able, statehood becomes fragmented and global..

Geography gets interesting

Cell phones become internet enabled and location aware, everything in the real world gets tracked, tagged, barcoded and mapped.

Overlaying everything is a whole new invisible layer of annota­tion. Textual, visual and audible information is available as you get close, as context dictates, or when you ask.

internal models

The blurring of the boundaries between interior and exterior, the real and the virtual, foreshadows the formal acknowledgment of the space at the intersection and the extent to which that intersec­tion can now be tangibly manifested and manipulated.

internal models are slipping out into the world like agile, colourful, and communicative ghosts. The same ghosts of our intent that traditionally emerged heavy and quiet in concrete and steel, or just as agile as their modern counterparts, but bound to paper and travelling slow and disconnected.

no need to stop and look at the map, the map overlaid on the space, and in the same field of view, will no longer be separable from the space.

..assumptions etched on our eyes

plasticity

In the sixties mathematics was animated in your head or in mechanical forms, heavy metal and concrete and steel were marveled at for there combined plasticity and the speed with which a building made of them could be conceived of and built

the more we integrate agile and manipulable externalised maps with our normal field of view, the more exposed the connection between the internal and the external becomes.

there is a more tangible sense of the interaction between internal maps and external reality

we will no longer ‘stop to look at the map’ reinforcing the split between interior and exterior, the map and the territory will be tangibly integrated in our field of view

as without so within

intersections

a headmap is bound up with the feedback loop when something internal is externalised, seen simultaneously in the context of external reality, manipulated in that context, and reinternalised

evidence of the intersection between outside and inside [real and virtual], the formal acknowledgement that something outside came from inside

until recently world and brain, physical and mental [mind and body], have been easy to see as split instead of intersected

is it real or is it virtual is the wrong question

Technology is rapidly facilitating the externalising of the interior journey of the last 30 years [drugs, computing, electronic media, network culture]

temporaryness and maleability makes internal outside more

 

apparent..

..a building is less obviously externalised interior because of its permanence and imovability

..from magick, ritual, mathematics, logic, tarot, mnemonic archi­tecture and theatre, drugs, maps, books and songlines

..to tinderboxes, gps, mesh networks, shimmering mnemonic architecture and theatre, drugs, networks, magickal suggestion, temporary and spontaneous culture and unlearning

we are beginning to see agile manifestations of our internal models moving and tangible in front of our eyes ..pliable and manipulable them, change them and take it back inside.

chemical maps, digital maps, architectural maps, narrative maps, symbolic maps, scientific maps, psychological maps, economic maps, social maps, diaries, learning maps, future maps

a road is a real thing, but it emerged from human intent (whether carved out by thousands of feet or forced through by civil engi­neers. Its origins are internal and its manifestation is a practical reality.

what was inside projected outside, something coming from inside clarified outside, an external manifestation that now acts on our interior model of what real is

theatre is a map that triggers meaning, as is archi­tecture, as are books and computer screens and social networks

..drugs are a projection of personal decon­struction, and the capacity of drugs to alter our experience of and response to reality is bound into the possibilities of wearable technology

so many possibilities are close to the surface, real­ity is tangibly collective collaborative experimental modern fiction

nodishness and spatialness

[ambient calculus for humans]

nodishness is about the boundary between the personal and the collective

..the boundary between personal extension of self and the collec­tive interconnected extension of us

noone is an island and noone isn’t

you preserve extended personal boundaries and don’t exist alone

…pushing the limits of seperatenss and dynamic connectedness

adhoc-corporate but still cellular

we had a network of static machines and moving people ..now a significant part of the machine network is moving as well – moving personal devices attached to people

you, your mobile device your weblog

but all these chosen personal extensions are designed and opti­mised to exist in a network of similars

..pushing chosen perceptible boundaries that are permeable, open, and connected

with technologies like rendezvous and open 802.11 nodes emerg­ing from broadband + wireless you’re not the edge anymore, you’re the way out for someone if you find the way out

..or just a source of interesting mp3’s while you’re in the same space

there is a layer of the network which is now dynamic, adhoc, impromptu and moving

and to that layer, proximity and spatial isssues are important. While we are reliant on radio transmitters and current technol­ogy, it matters how far, and whats in the way ..and because we’re moving we want to know about where we are and we want to find cool stuff here real or informational

analysis of the interrelations between weblogs shows people accepting and understanding their nodish fate in ever greater numbers. Linking in every direction and accepting links from every direction in a link economy.

eliminating the distance between the physical self and the digital identity will result in other forms of exchange beyond links

blogs are still stuck things

no reason why your network identity should be stuck so far from your physical identity

its one thing to attach geographical coordinates to a blog

but why not just go the whole way and have an abstract interface to your personal self beyond your clothes and how good your breath smells

in spatial terms, you’re already going to be walking around with ports essentially visible (whether open or closed). When someone electronically sniffs the air in the room you happ en to be in they see your devices whether you let them access them or not.

you’re not far from having to consciously think about the electronic signature you’re giving off

its likely to end up being something more than nokia or sony

..what kind of nodishness do you aspire to

whats your interface like ?

the physical distance between you and your digital identity is likely to decrease very rapidly

the pure abstaction of the internet is very attractive but the plain fact is that we are active parts of the network and essentially earth bound spatially orientated beings. Instead of disappearing into the world of bits anytime soon the world of bits is going to have to come out into the world.

..really it goes both ways, as we accept our fate and get on with

being mobile nodes

people are nodish in themselves: bounded but connected..

weblogs are personal spaces with nodish qualities..

Mobile devices are very personal devices, and nodish, the prolifer­ation of 802.11 and bluetooth built into these devices make mobile users walking infrastructure for mobile adhoc networks

“Mobile adhoc networking allows users to exchange information in a wireless environment without the need for a fixed infrastruc­ture. Each user (or node), equipped with one or more radios, is free to roam about while communicating with others. The path between any pair of users can traverse multiple wireless links and the radios themselves can be heterogeneous, thus enabling an assortment of different types of links to be part of the same adhoc network.” [from a mobile mesh website]

mobile adhoc networking technologies (like apple’s Rendezvous) are realising and resulting in personal impromptu networks, some­times connecting to wider networks, sometimes just to the people and devices in a particular room (maybe just sharing music or collaboratively working on hydra headed documents).

People: aware, processing, recording, disconnecting, moving, searching, connecting and retransmitting in collusion with their devices

more and more we (bound to our devices) are mobile nodes.

extended but bounded personal spaces existing in and facilitating networked spaces

external human interaction is more and more through this extended concrete and abstract personal space

nodishness

more and more, because of these concrete personal devices and these abstract blogish applications. You, extended you, but still you a bounded personal space (you a human.device.blog node) constitute a new thing walking the earth, traversing and creating

“The Internet has been at the forefront of the industry’s efforts for the past decade, but from a paradigmatic point of view, it was largely framed as an add-on to a personal computer. But now a personal computer is becoming part of a larger mesh of comput­ers and devices that come and go, with a mesh of services that come and go, and application design is starting to reflect that realization. With Rendezvous, Apple has come up with a very, very simple architecture that I can see a lot of people leveraging.” Tim O’Reilly

nodishness mixed with spatialness

headmaps and smartmobs

the internet is a collective, heaving, ever changing map already, with everyone contributing a bit of what they can see.

..theres a linux quote that i can’t find that says something like using linux is like living in a house thats always being worked on, you wake up in the morning to find that someones built a really cool extension out the back while you were asleep.

..an extensible metaphor that actually applies to the reality of the real world in general: really cool or really bad, you can bet some­one built something while you were sleeping.

adding a spatial or geographical dimension to the internet is a natural and ongoing extension in the light of increased mobility and wirelessness.

but the result is that metaphors start slipping in all directions..

maps becoming a persistent visible feature of the place they happen to map.. so that you need to mark the maps on the map or you won’t see the place properly

Devices are aware (and becoming more so) of location, of people, of messages, of connectivity and other machines. The users handle the other half of the awareness. ..and they all rely on each other.

It follows from increased mobility that the benefits and possibilities that arise from formally tagging information with place references become apparent.

location aware emergence

7 fairly obvious spatial/network capabilities that are already maturing and readilly available.

1). using mobiles to coordinate people in the same space you cannot see e.g. “i’m in the carpark, where are you?” or using texting to coordinate antiglobalisation demonstrations (smartmobs).

2). personal diaries for recording and sharing experience (blogs) extending to mobile devices. Mobblogging (mobile blogging) with picture phones, handhelds and laptops. Mobile Phones have only recently become ‘one to many devices’, you can now text to a group or send a photo straight to a web page.

3). Finding out how to get where from where you are to where you need to be is easy using webmapping tools like streetmap and mapquest. These tools have mobile interfaces so you can use them from a phone or handheld.

4). web accessible databases of place information (restaurants or whatever), are already being used by mobile users through services like Vindigo and Yell. You don’t use GPS, you just enter a cross street or the local post code of where you are to find some­thing close by.

5). Projects like Geourl are allowing bloggers to add tags to there web pages, that locate the blog in a particular place. This locates the conversations of bloggers. Paris bloggers, NYC bloggers, London bloggers. Tagging projects allow for adding location as a property to all kinds of web accessible information. UpMyStreet specialises in spatially locating conversations.

6). In car navigation systems are also becoming more common and even skeptics end up finding them really useful. GPS units can be bought for cheap, and are slowly being integrated into chips and phones and handhelds.

 

7). Because bluetooth and 802.11 allow local machines to talk to each other, if one of the machines knows where it is, they all can, and location information can be stored locally

Integrating all these capabilities gives you something new. Net­works and shared information about places without a centralised mediator.

connect and integrate all this extant thinking and given the gen­eral trend towards nodishness you are going to get considerable spatial weirdness emerging.

The longer term possibilities are new forms of exchange, coopera­tion, spontaneous governance, fluid digital architecture overlaying real space (marking, connecting, bounding, guiding, and illustrat­ing places), contextual computing, spontaneous interfaces to groups and spaces (people, playgrounds and tower blocks).

all increasingly possible (to the point of banality)

There’s never been a clearer, more real and open, or more inter­esting opportunity to try to discern the patterns of, and then to pro­vide maps, systems, models and prototypes for future community.

You will be able to ask the question who is my ‘closest friend’ and get a numerical answer and a position.

social software and spatial interfaces

localis(z)ation

essential interfaces

There is a lack of essential interfaces to 20th century ‘machines for living in’ (housing projects and urban environments)..

Interfaces to local communities and local spaces are finally evolv­ing after an extended period during which the development of communications technologies has focused on making proximity irrelevant. (global rather than local ..when does the next bus get here?)

- interfaces attached to buildings and empty spaces (for making better use of community spaces, sports fields, playgrounds etc).

- interfaces based on new opportunities for sharing and exchange (digital spatialised mediation of simultaneous need).

digital objects and creatures

digital ‘objects’ and ‘creatures’ attached to locations and spaces.

different meanings

Different people attach different meanings to the same space. Location aware devices make it possible to externalise these different views, make them tangible and share and extend them. (use the collective local cycle courier view of an urban space to find a short cut in an unfamiliar city).

invisible architecture

Location aware devices make possible: leaving notes, demarcat­ing spaces, and marking places, but leaving no external visible sign of having done so.

This lays the foundation for a new subjective, invisible, instant architecture (new paths, new places).

seeing the space differently

Location aware devices will remove the inertia, the objective real­ity claim, and the stabilising influence of the built environment.

Location aware devices allow individuals and communities to see the space differently.

Society will continue to fragment as the once shared meaning of the built environment migrates into many dif­ferent collective (subjective and invisible) views of the space (mediated by location aware devices).

Despite this new architecture being effectively invisible, the appar­ently out of context or ‘out of place’ human behaviour that will result will not be invisible.

Seeing the space differently may lead to radical social and politi­cal upheaval (the German ‘blitzkrieg’ was a consequence of a new spatial doctrine).

counter culture precedent

Counter-culture spatial and social exploration since the 1960’s prefigures the opportunities for spatial and social reorganisation offered by location aware devices (temporary autonomous zones, the hippy trail, communal living, extra-geographical allegiances, collective construction, externalised word of mouth, new ideas about value and exchange).

localisation

“Space will change. Localization may happen. The US may run out of cheap petroleum eventually.” Lawrence Angrave

Location aware devices make it possible to better leverage the space around you. To better integrate awareness of proximity into the extended communities (usually based on common interest rather than proximity) that have grown up around space folding technologies like the telephone and the internet.

 

This represents a technologically inspired interest in, and move towards, localisation.

spatial and social exploration

get free of the ‘line of sight’ labyrinth of streets and buildings

organise, augment and alter real spaces (add shapes, community and information to them)

drive cars that aren’t yours and live in houses you don’t live in

pay with what you have (even when you don’t have money)

ask for what you want, or, how you can help, and walk to where the answer is

phone the things you own (ask your keys where they are)

find the people you need to find

community and spatial inter­faces [soft architecture]

community and spatial interfaces

“There is as yet no new social framework that is as interesting as technology, and ideas, now allow.”

There are new ways to organise, make sense of, and leverage, local spaces and local communities.

New interfaces to the real spaces that people move through and live in are now possible. Technology is creating an opportunity for communications to become less mediated rather than more medi­ated, to get people outside and increase rather than decrease real face to face communication.

spatialising despatialised communities

dislocating:

The internet lowered barriers to long distance communications and made distance and time independent community a real pos­sibility for anyone with an internet connection.

The cell phone, pagers, email, fax machines, video conferencing, web sites, all enable us to conduct life efficiently at a distance from each other.

Communities can now be founded purely on common interest rather than spatial and temporal proximity.

relocating:

Making sense of local spaces and local communities is a problem that has been almost completely overlooked in all the efforts to make long distance communication easier.

There is a lack of effective interfaces to the spaces around us and a lack of tools specifically designed to facilitate local face to face community.

knowing where they are

cell phones (which at least allow you to go outside) are soon going to know where they are.

Given that cell phones have already become indistinguishable from computers and that they now come with internet connec­tions, the fact that they will know where they are is significant.

location aware possiblilities

Portable devices that know where they are can coordinate. They can make sure that two people who are close to one another and ought to meet, do meet, they can tell a person what they need to know about the space around them, they can link up people with something to exchange (according to unconventional or conven­tional ideas of what is sharable or exchangeable).

The potential for unnecessary barriers between people (walls, streets, not knowing each other) to be lowered is increasing.

The space local to people can become less opaque, they can see their location in terms more sophisticated than their line of sight. They can see the space in terms of who and what are within a given distance from them.

Developments in communication, from newspapers, the telegraph network, and TV, onwards have focused on making distance irrelevant.

On allowing people to communicate, observe and participate in events, at a distance from them. But a new technological platform is evolving that can make sense of the space immediately around us in a radical new way.

localising technology

Knowing more about where you are is an obvious problem, but in digital technology terms it has only recently become deeply solv­able (because we only just found ourselves with cheap internet connected cell phones that can know where they are).

Historically technology was about community and local orienta­tion, maps, church bells aligned to clocks for community time keeping, and astrolabes and sextants for star navigation were all significant technological enhancements grounded in making better use of local space and time.

new ways to mark, demarcate and annotate space

As well as facilitating direct contact between people, location aware devices will allow people to invisibly mark, demarcate and annotate spaces.

If I want to add a note to a place, I don’t have to physically mark it, I can write a note, add the geographical coordinates of where I

want it left, add the note to a database on the internet and when someone else comes to the place where I left the note their device tells them my note is there and allows them to read it.

No physical note exists but there is a note at that point in space.

Retinal displays that fire a low powered laser directly onto the retina and are small enough to clip onto a pair of sunglasses will allow graphical objects to be associated with places (burning skulls for bad restaurants, spinning tetrahedrons..).

..a landscape augmented with a layer of invisible marking, annota­tion and symbolism.

symbolism and utility spectrum

Because space is shared and owned, there tends to be a bias towards utilitarian (street signs etc), owner orientated and com­mercial imagery. Tagging, other forms of graffiti and murals mostly fall outside these categories and get suppressed. Location aware devices would allow subjective and selectively viewable aug­mentation of environments and give people the freedom to mark, demarcate and annotate spaces based on criteria beyond those dictated by commercial, utilitarian and owner orientated interests.

Utility arguments have led recently to the marginalisation even of architects; with engineers arguing (usually on economic grounds) that structures can be built (by them) purely following principles of utility.

Human beings don’t use the buildings they live and work in just to symbolically demarcate spaces, they are used to get out of the rain, or to regulate temperature.

If meaning shifts from the structures themselves to devices, it still leaves a lot of structures…

A fraction of the infrastructure and buildings in human environ­ments are primarily symbolic, but given that most buildings do encode a lot of information beyond their utility, it represents a real shift to have what they encode fall into the hands of individuals and communities.

utopian, distopian, inevitable

In the UK there used to be just 3 TV channels, limited sources of popular culture and news..

now with the explosion in content, and the diverse sources of that content, society fragments and the wider community has fewer and fewer persistent common cultural reference points

the number of possible subjective realities multiplies..

So far, in media terms, this has largely been confined to what music you listen to, what films you watch, where you get your news. When you go outside what you see is much the same as what everyone else sees, the same street signs, the same adverts, the same shop fronts..

But what If real space is overlaid with layers of invisible symbol­ism. What if what you see is determined by what the intersection of your extended community and your interests dictate, as well as what is really there.

Your view of the space and other people is supplemented by additional subjective annotation and symbolism (electronic equiva­lents of the information communicated by signs, clothing, physical demarcation, shop fronts).

Social fragmentation extends as the technology reaches in to define the whole experience of the space in subjective terms (a dystopian, utopian, or inevitable outcome depending on your point of view).

There’s nothing new about subjective filtering of space and people, but externalising the idea and undermining the apparently fixed nature of the built environment erodes notions of common experience and common reference points.

real life

A lot of people live in a house on a street

They might have a good circle of friends

But they don’t know that many people on their street

Parallel to that street are many other streets

They don’t know many of the people on the other streets

Further there is very little (that is socially acceptable) that they can do to get to know more of the people on their street or on the other streets.

If they’re bored they have no way to find the other bored people, if they need to borrow something they have a very narrow range of people to ask, and they can’t ask everybody on all the streets.

If they lose a cat, they have to go around sticking photocopied photos of the cat to trees.

In short their interface to their local community is really bad (even if they have a copy of the local paper).

Maybe they go to the local coffee shop and while they’re standing in the queue they notice someone who looks interesting. What are the chances that they are going to say anything?

And that’s the place they live.

What about when they’re somewhere they don’t live

..then the problem is even worse. Even with a benign guide like the lonely planet, they’re restricted to reasonably reliable com­mercial interactions. No way to reach out to the local community except through extreme bravery, alcohol or accident.

Without a lonely planet they’re stuck with neon hotel signs and mcdonalds and guesswork.

Cities have scaled up so that more and more people live in them, but the people in them are further apart than ever. Idealised close communities can only be found on TV shows, corporate cam­puses and in the compounds of religious cults.

Which is not to say that nobody has a life, just that there are big and very real boundaries (walls, doors curtains, streets and

social convention) to making sense of your local environment and extending the life you have ended up with.

Conventional points of contact are very blunt, scary and primitive, notice boards at the gym, ads in the local paper, getting drunk, dating agencies, going to martial arts or meditation classes.. (the internet counterparts of these are just as scary, if not more so).

Solving the interface problem would mean making space more immediately familiar and usable and introducing people who wanted to be introduced.

new ways to relate to each other and leverage and extend the possibilities for local community

Leveraging the latent potential from parallel rows of silent houses:

- a playground control system (for making better use of the square of tarmac that is the playground)

- spontaneous help/disorder system (amish collective house build­ing, pushing broken cars, organising riots).

- a boredom finding and resolving system

- coordinating laundry

hitch hiking is practically dead but there are more cars going where you want to go than ever

there are millions of spare rooms and empty houses and millions of people who wouldn’t mind you spending the night if they had reason to trust you and you were interesting, or you could pay them, or you had something to exchange

..you could find yourself driving cars that aren’t yours, living in empty houses that aren’t yours..

40% of food used is wasted in the US, people don’t share

there might be a parking space when you need one, but you can’t ask the people who can see it even though you might pay to know what they know

There are opportunities to help and to be helped, to exchange or share, that the bluntness of our current social interfaces exclude.

The proposition is that there is latent potential in the system that cannot be utilised without changing or augmenting the system.

The barrier that stops these kinds of transactions taking place..

..is that there is no efficient way to broadcast a request selectively to a trusted group of people you don’t know inside a set geo­graphical radius.

..you could solve this tragedy of the commons through a combina­tion of location aware devices, a trust system and a system that could filter and coordinate need.

Common property (common to small self-defining groups rather than universally and arbitrarilly shared) could work if you could solve the trust problem, the filter problem, the location awareness problem and build an interface.

the wealthy tend to share stuff among themselves (because they trust the other wealthy people).

new ways to formalise the sharing and exchange of non monetised latent value

[In many countries sex is implicitly or explicitly, illegally or legally for sale..]

A sandwich shop is not the only place you can get a sandwich, but a sandwich shop is a specialised source of sandwiches. It’s exter­nally marked, and visible and identifiable as a sandwich shop, it’s designed to be open and entered by people, and the sandwiches are priced to clarify the nature of the transaction. Convention dictates and supports the efficient transfer of sandwiches from sandwich vendor to customer.

So convention, visibility, efficiency (through specialisation and centralisation), dictate that when you want a sandwich and you aren’t near your kitchen, you probably need to find a sandwich shop.

So you need to find a row of shops and then find the shop that sells the sandwiches.

..alternatively you could state what you were seeking (in this case a sandwich) selectively broadcast your request (perhaps to a local subset of a community with which you are aligned), state the range of exchange possibilities you would consider (information, work or money, conversation, things).

The range of responses might include automated directions to the local sandwich shop, or a note telling you to knock on the door of the house across the road (if you would be prepared to take some laundry to the Laundromat in exchange for a sandwich).

Despite there efficiency, shops, money and 20th century conven­tion have a limiting effect: on the range of formal exchanges that are possible, the people who can take part in those exchanges, and where those exchanges can take place.

The problem with barter systems is that they require an incredible level of serendipity, both parties have to have something the other party is prepared to accept if the transaction is to be successful. Which is why cash is such a useful neutral point of exchange. The simultaneous need problem is surmounted by the neutrality of cash.

Physical markets were the traditional way of making the required serendipity more likely to occur.

The ultimate evolutionary outcome was that you would specialise in geese, bring your geese to the geese seller, exchange your geese for some coins and then go and buy some chairs with the coins (and the chair seller would buy some chickens with your coins, converting your coins into chickens).

But life is getting more interesting and if you are able to efficiently extend the range of possible exchanges, exchange locations, and

 

people to exchange with, then why not?

So you get a sandwich without walking further, at the same time meeting someone from your extended community (the system handling at least the greater part of the trust issue), and make the exchange in terms that might be more favourable to you than handing over money (or perhaps your money circulates within your community rather than outside of it).

You can know what other possibilities exist.

moving from a web model to an externalised identity model

This idea of broadcasting need is part of what has been called the ‘pursuit’ model. If you have a mobile device, beyond its direct communication function, you probably want it to help solve your immediate problems and to help you fulfil your immediate needs.

To take this idea further you could use some kind of externalised identity that can give a respondent a context for your request (community allegiances for instance), and a formal way for each party to measure the trustworthiness of the other.

Building trust systems, externalising identity, and matching requests to possible respondents are extremely difficult problems. But they are prob­lems that people are working on solving.

Huge numbers of people are walking round with mobile phones, that is, wireless digital devices that already know roughly where they are (and these devices are getting rap­idly more capable). Most of these devices are struggling to fit in with the web model when clearly the screens are too small and the tiny keypads inadequate for traditional web surfing.

The web is already in some sense an exchange, a way to get information from one entity or person to another. The problem is to build a more efficient exchange.

The web lacks the concept of identity. You may have an email address, or a phone number, both of which in some sense func­tion as a persistent extension of you, (collecting and facilitating the exchange of messages), but they do not facilitate more sophisti­cated transactions on your behalf. They differ very little from the function of the mat below your letterbox. You may have a web page, but an individual’s (as opposed to a corporate or organisa­tional) webpage is usually a fairly static entity, a symbol, rather than a transaction mediating entity.

The point is that your internet identity is not a coherent, function­ing, device independent manifestation of you, it does not formally embody your trustworthiness, it does not formally record your community affiliations, it does not communicate your needs or solicit opportunities to fulfil the needs of others on your behalf.

The web model can work pretty well if you have the time and the skill to find what you want, but the constraints of mobile devices both require, inspire, and offer an opportunity to develop, more efficient, individual-centric, and spatially linked exchanges.

filtering, reputation, trust systems and infomediaries

the deep irony is that even as people are packed ever more closely together the gap between them widens.

People have spent the last 40 years devoting more and more time sitting in front of computer monitors and tv screens simulating community and ignoring the people living next door and down the street.

blocks of flats, estates, streets of people who only get to realise that they might get along, or be able to help each other, when something goes wrong.

filtering

You can filter who you talk to by speaking in a specific forum,. Leaving a notice on a notice board in a climbing wall means that only climbers get to see the notice. Leaving a note next to all the notes taped to a particular bus shelter near 110th at Broadway nyc near Columbia university means that you narrow down the range of people who see the note.

~ anonymity

There need to be good grounds for sanctioning meeting people you don’t know.

Real life filters include the anononymity conferred by front doors, walls, curtains and cars. Convention dictates that outside of a narrow range of transactions (com­mercial, educational, crisis…) people for the most part don’t talk to people they don’t know.

Real life filters tend to be quite blunt tools, but people prefer tend to prefer blunt filters to no filters. The kinds of people who try to break through these filters tend to confirm the need for them.

Filtering is a problem, and it is not confined to local communities but all kinds of communities. Email filtering attempts to remove junk mail. Joining an online discussion group focused on a spe­cific subject is a kind of filtering in itself, but within those groups it is often possible to block out the voices of participants you don’t want to hear.

Filtering is a problem aligned to trust. We mostly choose to inter­act with people we are both interested in and trust not to make our lives harder. A good filtering system with a trust component would make it possible to find more people who fit this criteria, locally or at a distance.

formalising trust

A workable trust system could be built around traditional mea­sures of trust

..friend of a friend, similar views, taste and or buying habits, edu­cation, community affiliations, financial status, employer, reputa­tion.

Even with an effective trust system in place, in interpersonal ????????????

 

relationships it still only serves as a guide and lowers the barrier, maybe making a face to face meeting more likely to be worthwhile or safe, it still comes down to the reality of the actual meeting to determine the reality behind those grounds for trust

Trust is a difficult problem” Jan Hauser, Sun microsystems

infomediaries

A system which requires information about you to be broadcast is unlikely to be acceptable.

The solution is a trusted intermediary, a third party that handles filtering without revealing personal details.

There has been a recent explosion in dating agencies, and while they handle a very specific problem, they are a model for mediat­ing between parties without directly revealing personal informa­tion.

A community agency built on similar principles but handling a much wider range of interactions would be interesting.

This could be a further iteration on ‘craigs list’ in san francisco which already functions as a kind of community agency, a digital equivalent of a community notice board, tied to the space only indirectly, but still capable of making things happen that would not otherwise happen.

Recently craigs list made the national news after a girl posted a note about a ‘gorgeous guy’ she kept seeing at the bus stop on her way to work. The result was that each morning more and more people turned up at the bus stop to see the ‘gorgeous guy’. The boy, who was increasingly aware of something strange going on, only became aware of the extent of his local celebrity when a friend of his worked out what was going on and told him.

A range of new, sophisticated and interesting, ways of mediating transactions and finding and interacting with people are becoming available, and location awareness adds another dimension to the possibilities.

architects and their machines for living in

Architects and planners have designed buildings, housing projects, and whole communities, and then tightly packing those places with people who don’t know each other, and doing so with­out being able to build sophisticated interfaces and information systems for those communities.

Cities are arguably so complicated and house so many people that we may actually need technology and augmentation to be effective and happy in them.

The most help that has been offered so far has been video sur­veillance, a dark form of augmentation, which assumes you can change people by watching them.

A more pragmatic and people friendly approach is a location aware one. In Brighton in the UK and San Francisco in the US bus shelters now tell you when the next bus is coming (because they know where the bus is). This small thing will save souls, there is nothing worse than waiting hours for a bus that may or not ever come, it makes you feel so out of control.

..Corbusier and his machines for living in, Paolo Soleri and his arcologies and Archigram and the walking cities, all look like (and in the case of Corbusier actually are) nightmare scenarios, and the only thing that could make them happier places to live (given that tightly packed ‘modern’ alienated communities have become a reality) would be better interfaces to real and local spaces. This is a troubling thought given that it is dark to propose more techno­logical innovation as a solution to the problems that technological innovation has brought forth.

But if lost old age pensioners on a difficult housing estate could communicate with each other and coordinate their actions and their voice, it might make a difference to them.

With hindsight and foresight it seems inevitable that housing projects couldn’t work without information systems, and those information systems haven’t been built yet.

..and I want to know where my keys are and where I left my wallet, I want to be able to call them and ask them where they are. I want solutions to very ordinary, localised, spatially linked problems.

concept mapping [tinderbox view]

[basic introduction]

Say I have 10 different, but loosely associated, thoughts noted on a piece of paper and I open Tinderbox. Hitting return creates a new small rectangular box on the screen, the associated dialogue lets me name the box and then a text window opens where I describe the thought in greater detail. The text box closes and I have a simple named box on the screen (double clicking brings up the longer text description).

I do this for ten different thoughts and end up with ten rectangular boxes spatially arranged on the screen

[image]

I can then start to group and arrange them, cluster some, and separate others, leaving me with whatever spatial arrangement represents the order my intuition suggests. Then having decided on some arrangement and some grouping I can represent that

graphically by colouring groups of boxes differently. I’m free to say what the color means, based on the grouping I’ve established, maybe priority, maybe similarity, or whatever.

Say three of the boxes (now all made green say by slecting a colour for this sub-group) are places. I select them, open the new attributes dialogue and add a common attribute ‘geo’. I decide that this attribute is boolean in character (that is it can be set to true or false) I set the ‘geo’ attribute for each of the three ‘place’ boxes to true. then I add two more attributes for this green group: latitude and longitude. Incidentally having defined them once these are now global attributes and I can set geo, latitude and longitude values for any box (most new, and existing, boxes will by default have geo set to false and, not being places, will have neither lati­tude nor longitude values set or immediately visible.)

So now i have three ‘places’ and have decided that places are a new class of thing in my document.

Say three more of the boxes reference recent images i’ve cre­ated, I set their colours to blue to differentiate them, since ‘images’ suggest various properties I open the new attributes dialogue and create relevant attributes. I create a new attribute ‘image’ (boolean, and set to true), also ‘path’ – the path to the image file (a string attribute), ‘height’ and ‘width’, image file format etc.

Two of these images are schematics, but one is a photo of a place, so I set geo=true on that image and add longitude and latitude. Now should this box be blue or green? Doesn’t matter. If I search my document for ‘geo=true’ it’ll turn up and if i search for ‘image=true’ it’ll turn up (and there’s also now the new intersect­ing set of images which are also places which may turn out to be useful).

The remaining four boxes contain specific thoughts and are conceptually related, I decide that one is the central thought and the others are attendant so I drag the three dependant thoughts on to the conceptually central thought box and the main thought turns into a small container with the three dependants inside it. Hierarchy

When I double click the central thought box, this takes me down a level to where there are just the three attendant thoughts. Given these I decide to link two of the boxes to the third, I do this by click and dragging, arbitrarilly deciding to name the link type as ‘requires’ when the link type dialogue box appears, the boxes are now joined with two arrows with the small annotation ‘requires’ visible above the connecting lines.

I go up a level, double click the central thought box and add more to the text description. I also decide that one of the images is relevant and add an ‘include’ reference to the one of the image boxes.

Now I have given a shape to what were ten thoughts jotted down linearly on a piece of paper.

And not a cosmetic shape, a structure based on association and categorisation. In the document I have many more pre-existing boxes from earlier work and I can start to link boxes from the rest of the map to the new boxes and maybe move some from else­where into the new central thought container.

This map view is just one of many available ordering views on the box entities. As far as there is hierarchy I can choose to view that hierarchy as a tree diagram where all notes are present but notes that are inside other notes are shown indented. There are a number of other views.

I can also create a box and associate a search query such as ‘geo=true’ and have aliases of all the relevant boxes appear inside that box. i can also simply open a search window and have all the boxes matching a keyword appear as a temproarilly accessible list.

[end basic introduction]

At its heart is a database, which is fine but nothing new. What is different is the level of freedom and intuition that can instantly and flexibly be applied to an aribitrary set of ‘things’ without starting from a preconceived idea of what they are and where they should go. The rectangular boxes (the basic thought unit) can be any­thing I need to organise, or think about.

I start with boxes, cluster them, colour them, add attributes. I develop objects based on common sets of attributes, and allow real order to emerge rather than deciding on a data structure and trying to fit my thoughts into it. It’s not that all of this is not possible with MYSQL, python and a piece of paper, but the extent to which I don’t have to think about MYSQL, python (or the edges of the piece of paper) at the point at which i’m defining my knowledge representation, means that the knowledge can get on with decid­ing how it wants to be represented.

In fact once you have your spatial map, your attributes, your hierarchy (and changed them all around a few times, continually tweaking all the way), you can output your data as an xml file and feed it straight into MYSQL or whatever.

Alternatively you can create templates and output straight to html, rdf, rss (place feeds, image feeds, thought feeds) or just plain text.

At this point you can also simplify your knowledge representation, for example outputting a complex structure as a linear timeline listing only your latest ‘thought’ notes (ignoring ‘place’ and ‘image’ objects except where they are included within ‘thought’ notes, or where thought notes have ‘geo’ attributes). Maybe only output orange thought notes. The resulting ..blog is a watered down digestable feed derived from a more complex structure (you can of course output the complex structure as well – no rules).

So it lets your thoughts decide how they fit together using user defined spatial maps, links, attributes and hierarchy. All flexible. You end up with a knowledge representation that helps you both to organise further thoughts and derive further thoughts.

The level of freedom may not make everyone comfortable. Having to continually define attributes and hierarchy and remember where you are in mass of densely connected multilayered mess of boxes might not be for everyone [..it’s great]. The level of constraint may offend some programmers who want to hack together something very specific and outside the shapes tinderbox allows. But for people somewhere between those extremes it’s more than useful.

There are some issues (take it as you find it, it pretty much works as promised and for something so useful that is no small achieve­ment), but it’s obviously been around a long time and been worked on by some very bright people (and people who think about interfaces). The documentation is minimal but intuition and persistence usually get you where you want to go.

In fact tools like this (and there are a few, although Tinderbox is the one I’m working with, Ideagraph being more PC focused) are the missing link as far as ordinary users are concerned. Browsers,

 

filemanagers, email and newsreaders, all of them fail to impose any useful order on the material they continually stockpile. The basic unit of the internet from a general user point of view looks like being the paragraph of text, whether email, blog entry, section of an IM/IRC exchange or whatever. Tools like Tinderbox can break through the stranglehold of timelines, alphabetical indexing and a few inflexible categories, that for many users are starting to feel like bleak living arrangements. It is still the case that most of the tools that offer you flexible control of your metadata are ‘roll your own’, or enterprise level, at least at the moment.

simply put

file system <-> personal knowledge representation <-> browser <-> aggregators and peers

the first two should be integrated maybe?

Tinderbox and Ideagraph may well be what mosaic for the seman­tic web looks like.

On the Tinderbox site and elsewhere it’s been called a ‘personal content manager’ which is kind of OK, but I think it overstates the outward cosmetic view. Multiple and flexible presentation output forms are an easy byproduct of the data knowledge representa­tion possible using tinderbox, but the visual, spatial, intuitive, conceptual model is much more valuable, its a place to think. In terms of thinking tools it’s the difference between making a model that looks like an aeroplane and one that flies like an aeroplane. Tinderbox being in the latter category.

Recently headmap produced a movabletype plugin, reached the point where it needed two extra fields: longitude and latitude, and found that short of getting users to hack the Perl (which didn’t feel like an option) it wasn’t possible (at the time) [In defense one of the reasons for the success of blogging tools is the simplicity of the interface]. It wouldn’t be so hard to create a specialised authoring tool for ‘place’ feeds or to find a blogging tool that allowed extra fields. But really the problem is not just adding extra fields, its more general, how can ordinary users work with open frameworks like RDF without flexible agnostic authoring tools. Tinderbox is such a tool, RDF no problem as long as you create the right set of attributes and build a template, the output can be anything and is very much a side effect (its form agnostic).

It allows the building, authoring, and organising of knowledge rep­resentations (not arcane databases accessible through the slit of minimal web form or regular expressions at the command line, not collections of oddly named text files or an endless spreadsheet grid, and not a $6 million custom built enterprise specific solution).

Referencing the example above, having set the ‘geo’ attribute and added ‘longitude’ and ‘latitude’, those values are accessible when you export. The export template for an RDF place feed for one of the green ‘geo’ notes above might include:

^get(geolat)^ ^get(geolong)^

which in the final feed resolves the tinderbox attributes to

..a great tool for ontological anarchists

interfaces to the semantic web

Ted Nelson, who was the first to see the potential of hypertext had as his data ideal layers of acetate representing user annotations of an original document – you choose the layers you want to see.

Apparently Google’s initial goal was to develop a web annotation layer.

Personal data is increasingly structured and parcelled up (XML), parcels of marked up data are given unique addresses (a URL), then metadata about and relationships between URL’s (and more generally URI’s) can be stored anywhere with URI’s, XML and RDF tags acting as keys asserting the links and relationships between the seperated data.

This allows for a personal XML feed representing personal annotation applicable to various user defined URLs (the original document [URL] may contain author annotation, and allow direct reader annotation – so such seperations are arbitrary – but thinking about personal annotation feeds and documents seperately helps in thinking about this stuff).

Moreover using RDF it is possible for a machine (or a person) to succinctly deduce the *meaning* of the link a person (or machine) perceives between URI’s – and further those connections are expressed in terms of a shared and agreed and extensible vocabulary (RDF)

i.e. not just conventional links and metadata but traversible Triples:

Sam [subject - URI = sam’s email] –> KNOWS [connective (from shared RDF vocabulary e.g. FOAF)] –> Anna [object - URI - anna’s email]

That is a machine and human comprehensible relationship for­mally asserted between two URI’s using defined ontologies and vocabularies.

On the interface level structured data makes for a positive feed­back loop. Which is what has been experienced with blogs. A bit of structure has led to blogdex, technorati, trackback, feedster etc. Adding explicit machine readable meaning to links offers similar possibilities.

exposing and structuring data and clearly defining relationships in a distributed environment offers a vision of a new kind of interface.

Something that looks more like Danny Ayers Ideagraph or Mark Bernstein’s Tinderbox .

These tools allow you to create a personal and sophisticated annotation layer to data both local and external, and also to expose your annotation layer as an XML feed. They are very visual tools. More tangibly like maps and graphs than conven­tional PIM’s like Outlook.

A new object is depicted as a coloured rectangle, it can refer to itself or a file elsewhere, you name it, you can open it and edit it, adding text and images. Close it again and connect it to other boxes using RDF or your own vocabulary to define the nature of the links. Your main view is boxes arranged in front of you with arrows (carrying link annotation) connecting them.

 

These kind of tools allow for grouping of all kinds, by color, creation date, parent child, and hierachical relationships, link attri­butes, keywords – all allowing you to rapidly define different views on your data, both in terms of search criteria and in terms of the visual appearence of your map view (treemaps, outlines, charts).

From the point of view of the graph based front end note also the Plumb Design Thinkmap application Visual Thesaurus , and all the Touchgraph applications, these graphical views on data are starting to look like genuinely viable models for future desktop (and wearable) interfaces. Intensely structured logically linked data lends itself to this kind of visualisation.

Just using these tools results in smaller chunks of data, more structure, more link attributes, more metadata and more URI annotation (in the same way traditional blogging tools enforced structure and added metadata).

Given connections and nesting and a range of attributes to choose your focus attribute from, these models are highly navi­gable, and in an open context start to realise some of the promise of mindmapping and mindmap sharing.

More than personal content management tools they give the power to define relationships between things to the only intelligent agents on the net: people (intelligent tools + people = intellingent agents)

After a decade of hugely expensive visual, graph based, business management tools focused on exposing arcane databases as simple objects that can be linked according a vocabulary in tune with busi­ness logic, for business leaders to apply their intuition to (without having to send requests to the IT department), some of that power is trick­ling down into the hands of ordinary internet users.

Create a simple graphical representation of a local file with a URI linking the representation to the original file on your computer. Add attributes and metadata to the representation and then link the representation to other representations of other files both local and external, and logically define the links. Share parts of this map and have the ability to expose local files within the shared parts of your maps. Further these representations can become more complex [defining methods and attributes] defining the terms of interaction and function of what they represent. Drop, or link, a simple file representation on, or to, a function representation and generate new entities, or change the nature of existing ones, or maybe add representations of particular types together.

..and these ideas are rapidly headed towards the ordinary user: from the Semantic Web, open and closed source interface proj­ects like Ideagraph and Tinderbox to Microsoft’s Longhorn and Mitch Kapor’s Chandler.

these developments address..

the connections between things, the nature of the connections between things and seeing the connections between things.

These connections are now viewed as valuable enough to be considered seperately from the the things they connect.

..you can choose to expose as much or as little of your personal map as you like.

..you can traverse these maps to find information relevant to a given search criteria, or if you like someones point of view, just follow where they and their map leads you.

the paragraph of text

..have a lot invested in skywriting

been thinking about the paragraph of text as the sort of ‘golden section’ of internet communication

how blogs and email assume the same basic form, roughly a paragraph of text

and how they both (one sometimes seemingly, the other actually) resemble a part of an ongoing conversation

SMS users struggle with great ingenuity to get text messages full enough of meaning to reach the email/ blog paragraph level of useful meaning.

Telephone conversations are useful but email and blog entries have the advantage of being written down and we can do a lot more at the moment with stuff thats written down than recorded voices.

blogs, email, usenet, news feeds, text messaging.

. just paragraphs, metadata and a database on a network

these thoughts stem from the idea of annotating space, there will be visual ways to annotate space, but a paragraph of text would go a long way towards starting a conversation about a place.

back to the oral tradition through skywriting

“What was the adaptive advantage of language? It can only be measured in relation to the competition. Those who cannot acquire knowledge by hearsay must do it the hard way: by direct, trial-and-error sensorimotor experience.

.. In an evolutionary competition, the symbolic “thieves” quickly out-survive and out-reproduce the honest sensorimotor “toilers,” who must learn everything the hard way, from experience.

.. language is a form of reciprocal altruism: Except if we are competing for the same finite resource, you lose nothing if you tell me, honestly, what is and is not edible, or which are and are not dangerous predators; and tomorrow it may be I who know something that you do not. So “cognitive barter “ may be a better descriptor than “ theft “ for the adaptive advantage conferred by language.

.. Dialogue not only informs, and trades existing information; it also elicits and stimulates novel interdigitating thoughts that again may not have occurred solo. In that sense, interactive cognition may create information.

.. Surely it is writing that made science and scholarship if

 

not possible, then at least far more likely … But writing also had a dramatic negative effect … on the temporal, interactive dimension of linguistic discourse. It instantly transformed it into asynchronous, off-line monologues instead of the synchronous dialogues for which our brains and our thinking capacity are optimized.

.. One of the limiting factors in oral monologues is memory: If, in a conversation, you speak for too long without letting me reply, I will surely forget some of what you said, and my eventual reply is bound to be much less focussed than it could have been if the chunks between interventions had been smaller.”

..thinking about location awareness in terms of cutting together different subjective viewpoints

..and also about knowledge management tools.

The conscious mind seems to be one strata of a larger internal awareness.

The conscious mind has many ways to communicate with and access this larger awareness.

..and one way is through cut-up texts

The cut-up techniques of Brion Gysin and William Burroughs aimed to actively liberate meaning from texts and to bypass the tyranny of conscious attempts at organisation of ideas.

Gysin suggests taking texts that have meaning for you and some that don.t, cut them together and find what you are looking for (or at least something new) in your interpretation of what results from the cutup

..a good addition to a knowledge management tool would be one of the many cut-up engines on the net

There are a number of software cut-up engines, all you have to do is cut and paste one or more texts into them and hit the ‘cutup’ button

The ancient Art of Memory was a highly prized and praised skill as Frances Yates has shown (YATES66). It is of no coincidence that the ancients used architectonic models for their artificial memory technology.

[.]

It was for this reason, that everyone learning to apply the Art of Memory did so perambulating the halls and staircases of the temples and monuments. In these perambulations, the candidates learned unconsciously the intricate connections that had been incorporated into the construction of these buildings.

4.1. The tradition of the Ars memoriae

Art of Memory, Raimundus Lullus, Giulio Camillo, Giordano Bruno, Leibniz: Characteristica Universalis, Aby Warburg.

The issue of memory is a focus point in the discussion.

We must not be confused by contemporary mis-uses of the word memory for technological storage devices as they appear in computers: e.g. Random Access Memory RAM. Human memory is still an entirely different matter. This is just a good example how we can be totally mislead by wrong terminology.

These ratios could be experienced fully by the kinesthetic sense and much better than through alphabetically framed analytical and mental exercises as has become the norm in our linear-text based age.

Anything experienced and walked-through physically, with the kinesthetic sense, becomes an engram. It is memory matter that will not decay for life. (Everyone who has learned to ride a bicycle will attest to this. Totally unlike anything one has learned analytically and mentally only. This was, and still is, the secret of the Ancient Art of Memory. Since the alphabetically framed mind will be reluctant to even consider such an option, there is a good chance that it will be lost forever, even though it is mentioned here. It is hard to penetrate the fortified walls of 3000 years alphabetikolobos.

4.1.2. The peripatetic school and the implantable Walkstation

 

Perhaps it is not just a coincidence that the school of Aristoteles was called the peripatetic school (=perambulate). Because even though he never mentions the principle, Aristoteles was a quite acute observer, and the fact that all the orators and lawyers composed their speeches perambulating in the halls and staircases of the temples and public buildings, might not have escaped him. Even without the more esoteric principles of cosmic harmony, it is undoubtedly a definite factor that helps learning, and thinking, when you keep the body in motion, breathe some fresh air, and see some beautiful vistas.

The public building programmes, starting with Perikles, had seen to it, that this place was one of the most breath-taking and stunning visual experiences that any place on the globe could provide. So, even if he doesn’t mention it in his philosophy, Aristoteles might have known what he did, and why he did it.

[.]

Of course, a little technology that helps us do our word processing while walking might come in handy. If we have a Walkman, we can also afford a Walky-Symbolator. We are technically not too far away from the implantable Workstation, which we then call a Walkstation.

the connections between things more interesting than the individual things

Doesn’t it seem like the action in personal publishing has moved away from weblogs… and towards the interaction between weblogs? The blogosphere has become a living breathing entity, capable of behaviour that’s increasingly difficult to predict.

Which of course, brings us back to my latest obsession: Ants. As Mitchel Resnick puts it, there’s a similar relationship between ants and their colony (emphasis added)

Why the growing interest in ants? Many people, it seems, are intrigued with the collective nature of ant behaviour. Each individual ant is quite simple. But an ant colony as a whole is capable of rather sophisticated behaviour.

This is exactly what I mean! Extending the metaphor a bit:

PCs : Networks :: weblogs : blogosphere :: ants : colony

I definitely wouldn’t say that ‘each individual blogger is quite simple’. But there’s definitely some extremely sophisticated behaviour emerging out of the interaction between bloggers.

context aware applications

The following is an example of a complete stick-e note:

[The above note would be triggered if the user was within the specified area, facing South in December.]

[...]

PARCTab applications created at Xerox PARC were concerned with presenting information. These included:

- presenting information about the room the user was in, e.g. when in the library they could be presented with information about the library. This information could either pop up automatically, or could be under the user’s control (e.g. there could be a This-room button in the menu which, when selected by the user, gave information about the current room).

- helping the user find the most convenient local resource, e.g. the nearest printer. The PARCTab can present a menu showing all the available printers, and the distance of each from the user’s current room.

- attaching a certain UNIX directory to a room; when any user enters the room all the files in the directory are shown. The directory is writeable by everybody, so anyone can post a note in a room by creating a file within its directory (in an office: “Back in 5 minutes”, “Remember to turn the equipment off if you are the last to leave”).

[...]

Authorship [of stick-e notes]

how an author sets about creating a set of notes.

The approach to authorship follows the simple Post-it note metaphor:

(1) You write a note on your PDA screen, using a keyboard, stylus or whatever other means is offered. As an example you might be on the outward leg of a hike, and your note, written on a PDA with a location sensor attached, says “Turned left here, by the pond”.

(2) This is automatically stored as the body of a stick-e note, with the present context attached as its context. Thus if you are at a certain location, this is the context for the new note.

(3) Whenever you return to the same context, the note is triggered. Therefore, on the return leg of your walk you will be alerted to the point where you turned left on the way out.

At the end of the walk you might wish to save all the notes you made; these would form a stick-e document. You might give the document to a friend or even publish it on the web after you had refined it a bit.

The above approach applies equally well to our animal example. Here the context will be in the presence of a certain animal rather than at a location. We will take this to be the animal most recently detected by the sensor.

 

[...]

Stick-e notes are, perhaps, half way between a program and a document: certainly the contexts have to be as accurately specified as a program. There is little doubt that maintenance questions will be the limiting factor on how many notes it is viable to handle: would a tourist application of 10,000 notes be tractable? We have tried to anticipate the potential maintenance problems by adding features associated with programming languages: these include the use of types, declarations and testing facilities.

the declaration of interdependence

WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT (UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES).

ABSTRACT

The internet is a form of currency with more cool features than cash.

Thingster

The internet is a transport mechanism. A way of transfering infor­mation from one place to another.

As a transport system it is well suited to facilitating exchange.

It’s an economy engine, rather than an economic engine. It hosts markets.

Link economies, file sharing economies and one particular world wide garage sale.

It can bring a whole complex market infrastructure to any given physical transaction

rather than looking for cash replacements, for some mythical ecash, consider the internet itself as the exchange facilitating mechanism.

Lists

Napster was about everyone making a list (computer generated list of your mp3’s), aggregating all the lists and then allowing people to search the final indexed Uberlist for a fast match (local being a metaphor for fast).

Blogging is about a list of discrete diary entries each containing the currency of the blog world: identity, thoughts and links.

Again the lists are aggregated, you can search for thoughts, and blogs get ranked according to how many inbound links they accu­mulate and how fresh they are.

Like napster you can see what else a user has, if you happen accross something you like from that user. You just use an RSS newsreader to subscribe to that bloggers changing list of thoughts.

Its about structured aggregated lists…

Geourl

Now there’s GEOURL

geourl means that bloggers can specify the geographical location of there blogs in a general and machine readable and more specifically an aggregator/search friendly way.headmap has focused on the idea of overlaying the internet on to the real world and the real space,

and this line of thought extends to..

CONNECTING THESE NEW AGGRESIVE COM­PETITIVE DISTRIBUTED, AD HOC, ‘WEIGHTLESS’ ECONOMIES TO THE WORLD OF REAL THINGS.

Back to ebay

..all of which leads back to Ebay

“the market may be bottom up but its populated by chronically top heavy agents” Steven johnson, Emergence

maybe you have a lot of stuff, and some of it you’d be prepared to exchange or sell. You could use a service like Ebay, but they charge you for the privilege of selling your stuff, you have to go to them and you have keep an eye on their site.

Why not just make a list of your stuff and put it somewhere so that potential buyers can come to you..

Aren’t there tools for that now?

Couldn’t you make a tool to allow the creation of structured lists of real physical stuff and create a specialised list aggregator for this? Put GEOURL tags in the individual lists and have the aggregator index the lists by location, category and freshness for ordinary people to search for stuff in their area.

And this is the bare minimum..

 

..couldn’t you create external modules to plug into this open system? Reputation modules, privacy modules, maybe FOAF (friend of a friend) networks for distributing lists among your friends rather than just to everyone.

Wouldn’t this create a more generalised open and competitive market than Ebay?

And why stop there?

Exchange Criteria

Extending the principle you could also add a list of the stuff you NEED. Then the aggregator can start automatically matching needs to wants and buyers to sellers; connecting the right people in the right location. And this kind of market could sustain more complex exchange criteria than cash. In fact it could support ALL KINDS OF EXCHANGE CRITERIA

If two people want what the other has this system can hook them up. They can then decide the basis for the exchange.

One alternative criteria would be barter. Barter could work. If time, location and needs and wants are all in the sytem, needs can matched up to wants.

This doesn’t have to be a simple two person match. If joe needs what tom has and tom needs what sam has and sam needs what joe has, and they all live locally, the system can hook them up.

Mobile Computing

None of this takes into account the mobile computing revolution thats under way. Decen­tralised mesh networks. Take the center out of the system.

Theres room for a gift economy and trust modules here.So maybe barter has been forced so far into the subconscious of western society that its going to be hard to bring to the surface.

People still remember libraries though…

Books

Perhaps intitially restrict the systems exchange space to books.

Josh Schachter of GEOURL suggests: consider a ‘like for like’ exchange of just and only books. You make a list of books you have and books you need. Books have a namespace (ISBN) which is useful. And books have an abnormally large spread; that is you tend not to be able to sell a book for anything like what you paid for it despite its continued value to someone else who wants the book. So if you can exchange a book you no longer need you’re saving money and recirculating something which previously wasn’t cost effective to get rid of. Also if someone has a book you want and you have a book they want, you might have something in common.

The consequences of such a system working could be far reach­ing.

Just taking the final limited book example: this is a worldwide interconnected and distributed library.

If the system were generalised it could become a payment mechanism. A real supplement to cash. Your exchange list could include services (things you can do for others) as well as things, so that you could refer people to your list as means to get what you need. The internet is facilitating a wider range of exchange possibilities and market permutations, and by extenstion real life cooperation and collaboration.

Commercial Opportunities

None of this excludes traditional business oportunities. In fact an open system would create considerable opportunities and compe­tition. An intermediary could handle the transaction much as ebay does, maintaining a reputation database that determines the level of risk involved with dealing with a particular seller and taking a cut of the transaction. But fundamentally this system leaves the choice up to the user, whether to negotiate directly or engage a third party to handle the transaction.

Identity and Reputation

More interestingly it reinforces the right model for the future of the internet. The identity and reputation component, and the links between things are the only part behind walls everything else is distributed and open (even when its secured).

Hedges not walls.

Initially such a system could be linked to blogs. The reputation of buyer and seller can be assessed in terms of the bloggers repututation.

and community or social links implied by a system like FOAF (friend of a friend).

Exporting successful internet models to physical reality

Our collective distributed abstract exchange mechanisms are resulting in exponential (abstract) gains

physical exchange along the same lines will behave differently. But without a new model for physical interdependence how are we going to sustain these abstract models?

looking at the fascinating, aggressive and competitive collective distributed internet models – open source, napster, blogs..

We can stretch the models of cooperation, collaboration and decentralisation and above all collective interdependence

to include world of real physical things

“Decentralised production and development have done wonders for the world of open source software, where certain fundamental rights of ownership have been disavowed, but it remains a real question whether the more proprietary wing of late capitalism can model its internal organisation after ant farms or neural nets.” Steven Johnson, Emergence.

But this is about augmenting capitalism not replacing it. Its not

a Let system its instant localised market making. Cash is very efficient and will persist, but perhaps alongside a raft of other exchange mechanisms (including Let systems)

[..and doing all this is not that hard all of a sudden]

Napster and Ebay

..at its height napster may have had somewhere in the region of 50 million users.

..an estimated 30 million people were using Ebay in 2001

Ebay was one of the first internet stocks to be excessively over­valued. It is also one of the few internet companies that has been consistently profitable

When Ebay emerged as a phenomenon, people questioned its value. There was an argument in Ebay’s favour that went something like this: Ebay is a model for how all business will be conducted in future. When questioned, the woman running the company stated that Ebay was just a big garage sale.

Trade on Ebay doesn’t show up in the GDP. But it is having an impact on the economy.

Manufacturers have reported dramatic falls in returned good. People just sell the stuff they used to take back on Ebay.

And Ebay is efficient for both buyers and sellers. There’s a story about a woman who was selling a broken printer on Ebay, in the end someone bid $50 dollars for it and went round to pick it up. When he arrived she said to him ‘it’s not worth $50, i can’t take the money from you’, he replied ‘it is to me’ left the money on the table and took the printer home.

Ebay in many ways is an old school DotCom. You enter Ebay’s world, you play by Ebay’s rules. Even though it looks like a decen­tralised market the center holds, the buyer is seperated from the seller even as they are brought together. Ebay is not peer to peer. Ebay is not like gnutella or kazaa.

What components are most valuable?: maybe the central idea, the cash in the bank, the brand, the reputation system, the ability to mitigate risk and preserve the privacy of both the buyer and the seller, the payment system.

Internet Evolution

The last six months have seen a new embryonic internet emerge into the light.

This new internet is more decentralised, structured, logically inter­connected, people centred, and increasingly location aware

..maybe you have a newsreader that goes and gets rss feeds to save you trawling your favourite sites, maybe you have a blog which kicks out a structured rss feed and pings a blog search and analysis engine. Maybe you use one of the new selective blog search engines like feedster or blog link analysis engines like blogdex and technorati, or even a blog extended family tracker like blogstreet. Maybe you see the patterns emerging at a higher level. Blogs are now less interesting than the relations between them. Blogs are things to be aggregated, searched for patterns, ranked, indexed, analysed, those results being valuable to ordi­nary users as much as academics. What are bloggers tripping out on right now? Check blogdex. Feedster has a lag of about an hour, Google sometimes as much as a month. These tools are selective and they can become more so, answer questions like: what is this extended familly of bloggers tripping out about, what are my friends tripping out about?

All these new capabilities are emerging through distributed col­lectve tweaking.

rabid change in the techno economic subsystem

“the realities were money, prices, capital, shares: the environment itself, like most of human existence, was treated as an abstraction. Air and sunlight, because of their deplorable lack of value in exchange, had no reality at all.”

“the new style, as it diffuses, is bound to cause rabid change in the techno-economic subsystem. However this system coexists with the other main subsystem within capitalism, the socio-institutional framework. If the latter is mismatched to the former, problems ensue.”

Andrew Tylecote

free stuff

“However even those that have the technology to use a digital document on a primitive personal computer also have the power to reproduce and redistribute the document at virtually no cost. For this reason, publishers have had little interest in distributing articles in electronic form. Instead, publishers have focused on electronic publishing as an enhancement of bibliographic indexes. Copyright has encouraged the growth of libraries as an institutionalized system for allowing individuals the privilege of trading cost against convenience, of reading or borrowing rather than buying. In effect, this means that those who acquire and collect books and journals subsidize those who merely read them. Digital, networked information changes this, presenting a seductive vision of a library without walls but eroding the paradigms of print publishing at a very basic level. As network and storage resources grow in abundance, decline in cost, and are used for an increasing variety of purposes, the medium itself becomes increasingly non-specific, abstract, and trivial. [29] The distinction between the medium (the book) and the content (information) disappears with the dematerialization of the medium and disembodiment of information.”

Ebay seems a little bewildering, but they were considered by market analysts to be a potential model for future commerce on a more general level.

misunderstood technology

Redefining space.

Refining community, conflict, movement through space and con­trol of space in terms of new technologies.

The Germans decided to see the space very differently prior to WWII. In tanks and planes that hadn’t existed a few years earlier, they drove round and flew over static defences. They used radio communications and speed of movement in a way that those they attacked could not respond to. They spoke a new machine language.

Military theorists are struggling to assimilate the implications of new technology for future conflict.

Networked culture has yet to articulate itself clearly in spatial terms.

The real change happens when networked communities and data manifest in spatial terms.

Network culture is already colonising without being noticed.

..the nineties resemble the twenties

In this regard, the 1990s resemble the 1920s – the period after World War I – a time of major technological changes – with improvements in tanks, planes, and electronic warfare – leading to new doctrines that would optimize their use (e.g., blitzkrieg)

- achieved striking successes in the opening phases of World War II

the Germans, who, in their victory in the Battle of France in 1940, achieved success in four weeks on the same ground where victory had eluded them for four years during the previous war.

The implications of a revolutionary technology are often not widely perceived at first.

People try to fit the new technology into established ways of doing things; it is expected to prove itself in terms of existing standards of efficiency and effectiveness. It may take time to realize that inserting the new technology into old ways may create some new inefficiencies, even as some activities become more efficient. It may take still more time to realize that the activity itself – in both its operational and organizational dimensions – should be restructured, even transformed, in order to realize the full potential of the technology.

psychological time

[TIME]

The form of the environment can also affect one’s conception of time; psychological time as opposed to chronological time, and a varied and rich spatial environment can have the effect of making the experience seem longer than it actually is. This manipulation of experience works at a very basic psychological level. For example, we may recall times in our lives when we have moved to a new city or started a new school, and the first few months felt like years. Conversely, subsequent weeks or months seemed to pass much more quickly. Similarly, when we are young, time seems to pass very slowly, whereas when we are older, the years tend to blur together. It all has to do with how we take in information in our environment. When we are in a situation where everything is new and we are responding to a lot of stimuli, then time seems to pass slowly. When an environment is familiar, it becomes a seamless blur, and time appears to go by more quickly.

[where we are affects the quality of our lives]

Literature and theatre often make use of the manipulation of time to further the desired message and experience, either speeding, slowing, or an interplay of each in the narrative. The broad sweep of time in Tolstoy’s ‘War and Peace’, the slowing almost to a standstill of action in Joyce’s ‘Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man’ or Sterne’s Tristram Shandy, or the freezing of the moment epitomised by the Japanese haiku poem. Shakespeare, it is said, deliberately speeded up the action at the end of his plays to counteract the flagging attention of the audience. Analogously, architecture can be seen as a narrative of spaces and events, an unfolding story, that similarly manipulates one’s sense of time.

getting outside

facilitating community

Local communities can be brought closer together if common interest is allowed to intersect with location in a more efficient way. Why should people in a town not be able to establish more accu­rately where the people are who share their interests.

On the street where you live, the block where you live, the neigh­bourhood you live in, how many people do you know? And if you wanted to meet the subset of those people you might have some­thing in common with, is there any reasonable way to do it without waiting for ten years worth of arbitrary random interactions.

proximity

What if there was a system that could establish that someone like you was sitting around bored in the next street, that you had a mutual friend in common and the system can arrange to introduce the two of you, in a way acceptable to each of you.

Leverage proximity better.

Space games

What if you had to run around and climb things to play computer games rather than sitting in a room listening to headphones.

Imagine games which involved spatial challenges, and involved whole communities of kids, both building the levels and playing the games.

‘go to the end of the road and climb on the roof of the deserted cinema’

or rather (introducing a time element, and in order to get the next instruction)

‘RUN to the end of the road an climb on the roof of the deserted cinema.’

Such games might result in a few fatalities, but at least it would get kids out of the house.

mechanically regulating community

Church clocks predate personal time keeping.

The clock strikes loud to regulate a community otherwise discon­nected from awareness of mechanical time.

In this small japanese village a megaphone wakes the whole com­munity up in the morning, barks advice during the day and plays a lullaby at bedtime.

seemingly innocent english villages

Remember those hammer films, or those episodes of the Aveng­ers, when seemingly innocent English villages turn out to be living according to entirely different and usually malevolent rules and regimes. ‘The Wicca Man’ being the definitive example, a police­man (Edward Woodward) arrives on a small island to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, he slowly establishes that he is in a thinly disguised pagan community. At the end they trap him in a large wicca man and burn him to death according to pagan ritual practice.

In the absence of visual cues, and given the extent to which people can be permanently connected to distributed communities, it is going to be harder to make assumptions about people and there communities and affiliations.

Dualities

A person may seem to be one thing and turn out to be quite another.

double meanings [howard hughes hitch hiking]

“A recent tragic example of this occurred in the small town of North Zulch, Texas. There, some rural law enforcement officers apprehended a scruffy vagabond on a motorcycle after a high speed chase. Unfortunately he was killed. A search of his backpack revealed a device the size of a cigarette pack. The police officers, who were not computer literate, accidentally broke the device. This tiny device was actually a privately owned computer bulletin board system with some 15000 registered users.”

Bruce Sterling. Wired 1.4 Page 91

the richest most satisfying playground

Ignore mental abstraction for a moment in favour of physical real­ity. The real world is beautiful and complex and detailed.

simulation

I remember driving down a motorway on the way out of London once and seeing a tree in bright late afternoon sunlight and (after having spent too much time over the previous couple of months in dark rooms with 3d studio and photoshop), feeling struck by how much detail there was in the tree and how well rendered it was. This seemed like a dark thought at the time. Later on I worked at a company that worked on real-time physics simulation, and the implication (and motivation) was that reality could be simulated not just visually but at a deeper more fundamental level. Ulti­mately the simulation would be a satisfying alternate reality.

The vision of a 21st century games console hooked up by a fat pipe to the network, with accurate physics, stunning rendering, AI and other people to play with or against is still current. It is coming to pass in the shape of the Playstation 2 and the Microsoft X box. But it all seems rather dull and peripheral relative to the real revolution. The internet doesn’t need 3d, it certainly manifests in 3d, in the form of Quake, but it is not fundamental to it’s success or growth. Interesting but not core, not fundamental.

outdoors

The outdoors has been refined into an urban playground on the one hand, or a backdrop for extreme sports and ‘nature’ on the other. In some real sense it has already become a stage set.

The idea that you can now make a phone call from anywhere means the notion of wilderness is now defined by personal eco­nomics and technology rather than geographic location.

A friend of mine who recently returned from Africa told me about the battles and alliances in the bush, where multiple film crews from different networks and natural history programs were attempting to get shots of the same animal without getting each other in the shot. The noise and the lights and the generators transformed the wild into something else, but the product would ultimately be cut and dubbed to reflect the idealised image of ‘nature’ that audiences demanded

Mountaineers queue up to climb once rarefied and remote moun­tain peaks like Everest and K2. Western sport climbers bored of Thailand are bolting routes in Cambodia and Vietnam, widening their field of play. Snowboarders are helicoptered into remote areas to board down inaccessible runs.

Kids in urban areas skateboard, rollerblade and bike there way over every conceivable urban obstacle. Technology just makes outside more fun.

the space program

Two things are experiencing explosive growth, the internet and cell phones. Now the two phenomena are about to get integrated. From anywhere on earth for a relatively small amount of money you will be able to send and receive information including your geographical position.

During the sixties the space program began in earnest. From a cultural stand point it represented some assumptions: that there would be something on the moon when we got there and that actually going there was worthwhile.

When NASA abandoned manned missions to other planets, it represented a shift from an externally focused world view to an internally focused world view. From a belief in an outside that was worth reaching out for, to an obsession with creating internal worlds.

Computers have dominated our lives since that point, and the computing experience is epitomised by sitting at a screen and focusing on abstractions.

The idea of building whole worlds inside a computer, of not having to travel to real places because we have cameras and sensors that can tell us what is there persists, as does the conception of a computer as a complete internal world we can inhabit without leaving the safety of a bedroom.

Geography is unimportant we are told, communities, trade, com­munication, all are free of geographical constraints as a conse­quence of the internet. But communities of real people should be able to meet in real life, trade would be more efficient from at least a logistical point of view it were sensitive to geography, and com­municating with people who share a common interest locally can be more interesting given that you might be able to actually talk to them at some point without traveling to the other side of the world.

The frictionless abstractions that the internet has facilitated have already proved there worth, but imagine if those abstractions could be further leveraged to increase there potency.

Mobile phones are already augmenting reality in the moment. I can walk down the street (or through the bush), decide I need to know something, or talk to someone, and call to get an immedi­ate resolution to my need. (‘I’m lost, are you sitting in front of a computer?’ or ‘Melanie, you know about plants, can I eat these yellow berries..’)

1-800-questions

signs

The world is already full of external and consciously (and uncon­sciously) constructed visible symbol systems, advertising hoard­ings, street signs, bar-codes, lists of ingredients, post-it notes, shoes hanging from tram wires, clothing, architecture. All of which make reality richer more interesting or easier to navigate

One day there will be no visible signs. Or rather, visible signs will persist but the invisible visible (or audible) signs will be more important.

Knowing where I am and what I’m doing I can ask the network to tell me what information I should see or hear that would be useful or relevant given my position and interest.

Real signs might be reduced to machine readable symbols that just exist to link to the relevant information on the network. I read in the symbol on the engine block of my car and a repair manual (or voice link to a mechanic) opens up. Knowing the location of a wooden box exactly I could place a note in it without it actually being there. I could leave a huge burning skull in a restaurant I decide I don’t like.

augmentation precedents

The success of the film the Matrix was built on a vision of a digital world as complex and rich as our own. The interface to the out­side (the real world) was a cell phone [Nokia].

Neo: I need a little help

Operator: door on your left [Neo tries the wrong door] …no your other left

Morpheus at one point in the film asks the operator for a structural architectural plan of the building they are in.

The film can be read in a number of ways, one of the readings is as a key reality augmentation film, with just a cell phone the field operative can get any kind of information or help needed.

[Having an argument at the checkout at Safeway and calling in an airstrike from your cell phone. ]

Good film precedents for augmented reality technology include Terminator 1, which came out in the early eighties before 3d graphics were being used in films. The Terminator uses a 2d head up display which can supply schematic diagrams, telephone direc­tories, appropriate things to say and basic useful information like how to drive a truck. If anything that functionality is short of what is now possible.

Neal Stephensons ‘Snow Crash’ has characters who do noth­ing but gather arbitrary data using cameras and other sensors attached to there bodies. The information is fed to the library of congress and the data gatherers only get paid if anyone access­ing the library uses information they have gathered.

Another precedent is military technology, night vision, HUD’s, GPS, the whole C4i (Command, Control, Communications, Com­puters, and Intelligence) infrastructure.

For some time now wearable computers have been an area of interest in geek circles, at MIT and elsewhere, cameras and dis­plays strapped to the head, keypads sewn into jackets, computers in shoes.

At siggraph 99 there was a demonstration of a machine readable symbol system that would link to information on the net if it were scanned, scanning was done using pattern recognition and a worn camera.

All this reliance on gear is a little tedious

Cellphones (some location aware) with an internet capability are a reality. This is sufficient to begin moving in the right direction. Having said that, retinal displays exist and will soon be available and cheap, and as people become aware that the ability to aug­ment reality is no longer just a geek dream but a mass market

incompleteness

“Although the landscape before my eyes may well herald the features of the one that is hidden behind the hill, it does so only to a certain degree of indeterminacy: here there are meadows, over there perhaps woods, and, in any case, beyond the near horizon, I know only that there will be land or sky and, as far as the limits of the earth’s atmosphere are concerned, I know only that there is, in the most general terms, something to be perceived, and of those remote regions I possess only the style, in the abstract. In the same way, although each past is progressively enclosed in its entirety in the more recent past which has followed it, in virtue of the interlocking of intentionalities, the past degenerates, and the earliest years of my life are lost in the general existence of my body, of which I now know merely that it was already, at that time, confronted by colours and sounds, and a nature similar to the one I now see before me. I possess the remote past, as I do the future, therefore, only in principle, and my life is slipping away from me on all sides, and is circumscribed by impersonal zones. The contradiction which we find between the reality of the world and its incompleteness is the contradiction between the omnipresence of consciousness and its involvement in a field of presence.”

I know you will think it a good joke, as indeed it is, when I tell you that your old friend has caught three boars, very fine ones too. Yes, I really did, and without even changing any of lazy holiday habits. I was sitting by the hunting nets with my writing materials by my side instead of hunting spears, thinking something out and making notes, so that even if I came home empty handed I should at least have my notebooks filled. Don’t look down on mental activity of this kind, the mere fact of being alone in the depths of the woods in the silence necessary for hunting is a positive stimulus to thought. So next time you hunt yourself, follow my example and take your notebooks along with your lunch-basket and flask; you will find that Minerva walks the hills no less than Diana.

behind the next hill

I live in a box, I walk down the street and I pass other boxes. Occasionally I see someone briefly at a window, I somehow know that there are people in all the boxes, that the there are lives going on all around me that I cannot see. So much is taken on trust and the percentage of other lives that I see with my own eyes is small. Media feeds the feeling that I have a grasp of what is going on around me, and dulls my sense of distance and dislocation from the world. I think I know what other countries are like, what other parts of my home town are like, what other people are like, based entirely on information derived from media rather than personal experience. People are always different when you meet them, even if you know a lot about them

Zero media is a ‘year zero’ position. Seceding from passive media is quite common, lots of bright people I know don’t watch TV or read newspapers. They don’t trust the mass media, it seems to be feeding them a false sense of knowing and comfort, and dulling there capacity to know and act in the real space. How distanced is the news from the event it reports on, how much do I really know about the real experiences of others from having them presented to me on television in my living room. Doing a thing or being somewhere is always different than I thought it would be, even I’ve seen it done or been told what its like. The media offers me something, but not the experience itself. It can offer me a clue (and that can be a good thing), bad things have happened in former Yugoslavia for example, but I’d have to be there to begin to know what the pictures mean.

Cutting the media umbilical chord changes the whole shape of the world. Everything changes, you think about the space differently, you do more, you have more time and you make more of an effort to actually see rather than relying on mediated sources, rather than grinning mindlessly.

Cut television out of your life and life changes.

‘It was three days, before I was told that Princess Diana had died (very weird), I noticed a Union Jack at half-mast over the engineering building (extremely unusual), jets flew over Oxford in formation.

I overheard a conversation

‘how was London yesterday?’

‘lots of flowers, flags at half mast’

No information to tie all this together. And why should there be? It wasn’t a direct part of my life, I wasn’t tied into the mass media so it didn’t reach me.

Ironically you still hear about everything eventually anyway. People tell you things that only make sense if you assume some context you have no direct grasp of. I knew there were Spice Girls because people told me Spice Girls jokes.’

I have some vague model in my head of countries I have never been to, I trust that they are there and that if I boarded a plane and headed in the right direction that place would be, at least very roughly, as I had expected.

How to enhance appreciation of the world around you without, becoming dulled by a false sense of knowing.

Subordinate all information about an experience to what you con­sider to be the real experience.

guides

I want to have access to every conceivable kind of guide. I want voices to tell me about the place I happen to be in. I want to see the footprints of local people showing me how they navigate the space. I want to be able to ask for help of any kind and get it. I want to be able to call in air strikes at safeway.

wireless networking as a precursor to augmenting

In the wake of huge investment in high bandwidth wireless net­working, the networks that are evolving are different from there wired predecessors. The world wireless networking makes pos­sible is still to be built.

A world will emerge in the new spirit spontaneously and it will take time to establish its characteristics and determine its shape.

connect everything to everything

“The central act of the modern era is to connect everything to everything” Kevin Kelly

semantic reality

the initial impulse to connect everything to everything has already started to mutate into connecting everything to everything in a meaningful way, the semantic web adding meaning to the ele­ments of the network (data) and to the links between the elements (creating vocabularies to describe the nature of a given link).

the expansion of the highway system

“In 1919, Major Dwight D. Eisenhower had led his motorised military expedition across the United States with barely a road system to follow. It got him thinking about the motorways of the future. Thirty-seven years later, in 1956, president Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Interstate Highway Bill, which provided for a 41,000-mile superhighway system (later raised to 42,500 miles) that would crisscross the nation. The Federal government would pay 90 percent of the cost, with most of the money coming from a specially designated, non-divertible highway trust fund accumulated out of gasoline taxes. The program was actively advocated and promoted by a broad coalition of interests that became known as the ‘highway lobby’- automobile makers, state governments, truckers, car dealers, oil companies, ruber companies, trades unions, real estate developers. There was even the American Parking Association; after all, no matter how great the distance covered, drivers would eventually have to come to the end of their trips – and park their cars.

Eisenhower himself advocated the interstate highway program on several grounds: safety, congestion, the many billions of dollars wasted because of inefficient road transport, and, evoking the darkest fears of the Cold War, the requirements of civil defense. “In case of atomic attack on our cities,” he said, “the road net must permit quick evacuation of target areas.” The resulting program was massive, and Eisenhower took great pride in the scale of the construction, using wondrous and mesmerising comparisons. “The total pavement of the system would make a parking lot big enough to hold two third of all the automobiles in the United States,” he said. “The amount of concrete poured to form these roadways would build eighty Hoover Dams or six sidewalks to the moon. To build them, bulldozers and shovels would move enough dirt and rock to bury all of conneticut two feet deep. More than any single action by the government since the end of the war, this would change the fate of America.” His words were, if anything, an understatement.”

The Prize – Daniel Yergin

internet is not the same as freeway

The internet is not the same as the freeway network in america, but it has some themes in common.

The internet was designed to be able to survive a nuclear attack and at least a stated proposed use of the highway system was to enable evacuation during a nuclear attack.

Despite all the focus on internet companies like Amazon and Yahoo (the dotcoms), the real economic issue is not the compa­nies that claim to be the commercial internet, but the fact that like freeways, the internet just changes the way information and goods flow through the system. If the internet is having an impact on the real economy it is because it is affecting the way all transactions are being conducted (taking the broadest definition of transaction to include receipt of information, email, trade, website hits etc.).

a spatial external network

Unlike the internet, the freeway network is external and deals with the movement of goods and people as well as information.

augmenting the road system – parasitic technologies

The freeway network also represents a nexus point for the conver­gence of internet access and wireless location aware devices.

The freeways reshaped America, they conjured up suburbs, malls, motels, restaurants and gas stations. They reinforced America as a huge homogenous market that distributors could easily supply. They enabled easy migration from anywhere to anywhere. Given the level of mobility already built into American life and consciousness (LA is a great big freeway). What will the result of the addition of a new layer of technology augmenting this infra­structure conjure up. Cars will be location aware and connected to the internet. Driving through some remote valley you will know if something interesting is happening outside your field of view, or if a particular town is worth stopping in, or if someone in your extended community lives nearby. Your immediate surroundings can become more than just scenery merging into an irrelevant blur.

coordination and support of field operatives

“I asked the major over wind and noise about the strange warning sign that had caught my attention early in the morning. “Desert tortoise,” he shouted. “Fifty thousand dollars if you kill one.” “The scientists claimed to be matching the warfighters chip for chip in the information war. Tortoises were tagged with transmitters, tracked by radio telemetry, and graphed in grid locations by

computers. Landsat satellites were used to identify good habitat areas, aerial mine detection technology to find tortoises moving on the ground, and electronic sensors to warn off vehicles that might endanger the creatures.” James Der Derian – Cyber-Deterance [Wired 2.09]

military origins

the military gave us GPS, head up displays, computers even. C4i (command, control, communications, computers and intelligence) integrates all kinds of technologies, to augment the capabilities of troops in the field with every kind information and support, and to supply commanders with a model of the entire theatre of opera­tions.

prototypes

The technology developed to equip special forces for the next low intensity conflict.

Even less technologically advanced, and civilian orientated, forces are useful for determining precedent.

Police forces around the world make heavy use of the radio. Radio communication is a fundamental capability upon which command and control can be built. The radio links back to a com­mand centre, full of operators in contact with officers, with access to information (maps, databases etc.) men, vehicles and equip­ment.

This kind of support infrastructure is what is being made avail­able to civilians through the convergence of cell phones and the internet.

the ally

THE NATURE OF THE ALLY

The old doctors had helpers

Maybe the power plant was a conduit, or a call, a sort of whistle. Or the plant was like a delivery service. Not like the plant itself was the ally

maybe the ally lived in the plant, or maybe the ally lived in the next world, and the plant was like a bridge

That plants have virtues, or ‘vertues’, was known by the ancient herbalists. The Virtue of a plant was its truth, its strength. Maybe the best synonym is integrity. Or power. Or poison.

The ally is the one who helps you. That is what an ally should do. Allies assist each other in the prosecution of some task.

Allies may also have agendas of their own, however. That is, an ally is not like a fairy-godmother, but is a powerful force in its own right.

An ally is like a half-broken horse, a horse with spirit. A horse that will carry you many days, only to suddenly knock you off on a low branch. Some allies are the subtle type. Maybe You have an ayahuasca saly. She is friendly. She gives you things. She doesn’t seem at all malevolent. Or maybe you have an opium ally. She is more than friendly. She’ll call you up and invite you over. And she is voluptuous, so you go. She is so good to you it seems like heaven. You get what I mean.

instant tools

Aborigines have few tools or objects and rely on ‘instant tools’, that is they recognise potentially useful objects in the environment. If this object matches a ‘mental template’ or idea of a tool, for example a spear thrower, a concrete object results.

Group members share food as well as other possessions, and among aborigines articles have been traced through 134 persons. This sharing creates friendship and social values are more important than economic ones.

Hunters do not store food but regard the environment as a storehouse. While each local group is associated with a geographic range there is considerable visiting among groups which do not maintain exclusive rights to resources but have flexible arrangements. At the same time most groups have a home base or camp.

This generalised description of the way in which hunters and gatherers (including aborigenes) use space can be expressed in terms of a set of concepts derived from animal studies

Home Range – The usual limit of regular and activities, which can be defined as a set of behavioural settings and linking paths.

Core areas – Those areas within the home range which are most used and most commonly inhabited.

Territory – A particular area which is owned and defended – whether physically or through rules or symbols which identify the area of an individual or group from others.

Jurisdiction – ‘Ownership’ of a territory for a limited time only, and by some agreed rules.

Among animals the size of home range and core areas and their coincidence, and the times and duration of jurisdiction depend on the natural conditions (climate, rainfall, resources) on the one hand and the animal species on the other. In the case of hunters also the same physical factors play a role as do the values and life-style of the group.

mesh networks politics and law in software

software as constitution and law

[users]

Any piece of software has conventions and methodology that govern you while you use it. You have to work in the way the soft­ware prescribes. Hotmail conditions the way you use email. Micro­

 

soft Word conditions the way you write; it forces you to capitalise words at the beginning of sentences when you don’t want to and alters the spelling of the words you misspelled on purpose. In fact all Microsoft products condition your behaviour. They proscribe the way you carry out the task they are helping you perform. You are governed by an imposed constitution and law, by the philoso­phy of the people who wrote the software.

Software is often reconfigurable and extensible, the environment you are working in can usually be radically changed to suite the way you work. Microsoft Word for example is actually massively reconfigurable and below the surface is very powerful. In the hands of a Microsoft Word guru, Microsoft Word can do almost anything (one of the reasons why there are so many Microsoft Word viruses). Even a dumb user can stop it from correcting their spelling. But most people don’t customise their environments and live under the tyranny of the software’s defaults.

linux

In the Unix community hackers fight religious wars in defense of their prefered on screen working environments. The arguments centre on questions like whether a particular editor is less intru­sive or more flexible or powerful, and the tone of the arguments imply that using a particular editor implies an entire world view.

The arguments extend to operating systems. Being a Unix user or a Mac user or a Windows user implies differences in your whole way of life.

Beyond editors, hackers have the way they work, the way they write code, conditioned by operating systems.

Consequently we have Linux. Linux is an entirely free operat­ing system, with all of its underlying code available for anyone to peruse and hack away at. Generalising somewhat, the Linux com­munity see the collective development of Linux as a political act. Linux represents freedom from the tyranny of closed and arbitrary constitutions. The Linux community sees itself in direct opposition to the closed orthodoxy of Microsoft.

addapt

Addapt [www.addapt.org] is an experiment in developing net­worked community. Addapt was developed by Rich Persaud as generic community building software.

Each member of an addapt community has a profile. If you want to see the photo of another member you have to submit one of yourself. If you don’t submit a photo of yourself you can’t see anyone else’s, if you don’t submit a bio you can’t see anyone else’s.

You have to contribute to see what others have contributed.

No spectators.

“Chess is an example of how a fixed set of rules does not restrict freedom but rather creates freedom” Herman Hertzberger

the landmark lessig ruling

This is the final statement, at the end of the last of the P2P file sharing cases (which was presided over and concluded by Shakil Meritam, who some considered the ideal geek judge).

It was directed at artists and programmers of all kinds but specifi­cally at the 22 year old singer who had filed the prosecution case.

The summation took place in late 2005 at a point when the Lessig presidency was forcing through the fastest most far reaching legal and political transformation in American history.

Shakil, a young judge at 33, was a man who had some empathy for artists having written some really clever and much respected open source code in his younger days.

“This ruling will be hard to swallow if you were comfortable in the old world, but in the light of the recent dramatic world events and the logic of the new administration, and specifically the landmark majority verdict reached by the recently repaired Supreme Court, it’s clear that not everyone was. Let me outline where we are now with respect to this case.

It is my greatest regret that it will affect artists themselves not just the parasitic industries that have grown up around their talent. Those of you, for example, that make a living directly from writing or coding or making movies or singing,

The essence of my ruling, which follows from the technical and market realities as this court perceives them, is that you can still charge for access, and for physical things, but you cannot impose constraints on the redistribution of bits.

Also there is no change, despite the prosecutions arguments con­cerning the technical difficulties of enforcement, in the Supreme Courts caveat ruling against abuses of personal data privacy. Aggregating or redistributing pesonal data without explicit permis­sion is still unlawful.

The truth is that copyright as we used to understand it wasn’t just easier to uphold because copying was hard and distributing was easier to control, it was predicated on it. The law can only help you so far. Copyright as we used to understand it was reasoned, and in some cases reasonable, opportunism based on technologi­cal circumstances.

I have not ruled that all the ideas behind traditional copyright should be abandoned just that they should only apply where it makes technological, political, and social, sense.

I’m sorry you steal feel they stole your work, I have to confess I even have some mp3’s of your songs myself. I really like your stuff. But heres the position: I can’t allow you to invade privacy, lock everyone of us up, cripple everyones machines and remove useful functionality just so you can buy a huge condo and a pri­vate jet.

What I can do is sign you up early for the new ‘artists wage legis­lation’ that you and the recording industry are so bitterly opposed to. That legislation, as you probably know, gets users (people mostly) to register their media downloads.. Based on the down­load measure you can get paid the new ‘artists wage’ (on a sliding scale based on popularity). The system is not in place yet and It’ll be hard to do and hard to verify, but i think its going to work out fine.

 

That will give you just enough to live on, and maybe a bit more cos its you and you’re a really popular strategic propoganda asset of USA inc.

After that you might want to consider this:

I am not abolishing the market, all of the underlying principles of copyright, or money, as some old (and controlled) media head­lines have suggested.

Neither am I removing all your possible means of supporting your­self or growing wealthy.

This and the points i will now make are not facetious, they are the consensus reality my ruling subjects you to,

If you want to keep the public from just ‘stealing’ what you have and not giving anything back you will have to alter the nature of what you give them and the way you give it to them. It is my view that despite your denials you have already gone some way towards this reality.

I’ll try and give you some examples of what I am suggesting.

You could make something real and not reducable to bits (but still distributable) and make it intrinsic to your bit reducible art.

You can require or suggest real things to complete the digital experience (or become marketing material for harder to reproduce and easier to control goods) and make money that way (incidentally if you were thinking of arguing the point that logically follows that – at the point at which everything is easy to reproduce, money won’t matter so much anyway.)

What I am suggesting, you and your industry already well understand. Acknowledging these unwritten rules (not locking down copyright) will lead to innovation beyond the computer screen. That is, it will be good for the transfromation of physical reality..

To get a user to pay to view or listen, you must make your work more satisfying if viewed in a complex, hard to reproduce setting. People will pay in those circumstances. Moreover the law will back you if you ask them to pay for access and they try not to.

..that doesn’t give a license to cripple copying and distribution mechanisms (look how much good feeling that generated)

I’ll say again I can only help you protect physical things and access to streams of bits, but not the bits themselves.

You can argue as long as you like about the supposed injustice of that, but it is your reality and you must learn to live and survive in that reality.

You can still get paid. You could create an environment that is always on, ever changing and that fundamentally requires real time interaction. That is, an environment that is only relevant when connected. You could then charge people who want to be connected to your world. You can charge for an account on the server, specifically *not* the client software, or a *track* or what happened yesterday.

Offer a real time service not a dead chunk of data.

The industry that funded your appeal had an opportunity early on to build a culture of subscription for tracks and movies but you blew it for the sake of greed, and i can’t put that genie back in the bottle for you.

I ask you to think of George Lucas realising the potential for star wars toys,

Different kinds of artists and creative industries have evolved different approaches in each new creatively, technologically and legally constrained circumstance and they *must* continue to do so.

here are some of those historical, extant approaches, that prove my point about creative industries understanding these ideas prior to the new legislation:

Sell fast machines and graphics cards (video game tactic), public performances and tshirts (music tactic), big cinema + blobject + mcdonalds license (film tactic), physical books and rubber chicken circuit (author tactic), the unfeasibly huge freeway sculptures by Arnish Kapoor in LA (fine artists tactic)

Face it, you go and see ‘Lord of the Rings 4’ in a cinema because it is more satisfying than watching the DVD on your laptop, and you pay because you want to be there and they own the building.

You bought a computer because without it you couldn’t see the DVD.

You read a book cos at the moment its easier than printing out the hacked PDF

Now think of all the bands that get paid to play live and make all their money selling tshirts from a table at the back of the hall

Major commercial artists and producers already recognise this, you realise this, and you just want to get paid many times over. Which is OK in principle, but if one of those ways you want to get paid requires crippling peoples computers and slowing down the flow of digital information then that way is *not* OK.

Access rights I can enforce, privacy rights i will try and enforce, dead data redistribution rights i can’t.

I think the honest way forward isn’t crippling the machines it’s constant evolution and imaginatively binding digitised art to reality in *new* ways

In physical terms i think that means more than t-shirts.

..to be valuable within this new legal framework data can be bound to the outside, to the physical world and to the real pres­ence of the artist

From a marketing perspective companies like Nintendo already recognise this: look at their swipe card trading cards, but i’m afraid even that falls short of my ruling

Mobile computing has already opened up the possibilites and not just to marketing scams but to real innovation

Location aware games now allow locations to be critical to games and you often have to pay to get in to a game critical location.

This legislation is a carefully considered challenge to artists, The public won’t let you starve because we like your stuff (or some of us do) but i’m afraid today we want more from you.

don’t just make things reducible to dead sequences of bits

you must now take responsibility for (and the rewards that follow from) transforming physical reality, don’t just sing into a computer for three minutes about change and hope someone else does it

you’re likely to get paid if you change the outside (or force a change in our real time experience of the inside)

On your way out, remember you have a mighty and unfettered network that wants to hear and see you

and you can use that network in innovative ways that i haven’t forseen, you can also use the digital media you already know how to create, distributed free, to support your efforts to transform reality. And if it matters to you and you’re clever or you partner with the right people you could get paid a lot of money for finding a commercial interpretation of this landmark ruling.

..and finally remember that your physical presences as an artist increases in value according to the square of the number of mp3’s that people ‘steal’. It was a real buzz to spend so many weeks with you.”

headmap received this important clarification by email shortly after this was written

“note that the audience’s untilled, emotional farmland is a single-use commodity that will be recapitalized by many industries exter­nal to the “music” industry

imprinting certain songs on the brains of a teenage audience during their formative years serves as a selection mechanism for future radio stations, commercials, period movies, etc

the period of harvesting the fruit of these early seeds is when the onetime teenagers reach their early-thirties – old enough to have earning power, young enough to have disposable income (low chance of mortgages, kids, etc).

the teenagers’ attention should be treated as part of a transac­tion … companies that engage said attention are benefiting from a (re)transmission medium for which they are never billed … and can never be reused … formative memories (imprinted on virgin minds) are never lost or less intense than their successors.

songs are like links in blogs … molecules that anchor chemical reactions, given appropriate catalysis … they are chrono-emotio-spatial hash signatures by virtue of early binding to formative experiences

the limited resource, the economic resource is not the songs … it’s the formative experiences … which are being sold in an invisible transaction that commits the memory’s owner to a lifetime of sub­sequent heartstring-pulling … unpaid and involuntary.

the music industry can and does make money by selling perfor­mance rights to these songs, into infinity … even if _all_ the songs were given away for free on P2P networks … they are an anony­mous sorting mechanism … the only problem is the 17-year gap between binding the song to a memory and harvesting the dispos­able income of the memory’s owner.” Rich Persaud

social organisation

twelve principles of collaboration

12 Principles of Collaboration

[from mongoosetech.com ]

Purpose

Community exists because the members share a common purpose which can only be accomplished jointly.

Identity

Members can identify each other and build relationships.

Reputation

Members build a reputation based on the expressed opinions of others.

Governance

The facilitators and members of the community assign management duties to each other, allowing the community to grow.

Communication

Members must be able to interact with each other .

Groups

Community members group themselves according to specific interests or tasks

Environment

A synergistic environment enables community members to achieve their purpose.

Boundaries

The community knows why it exists and what or who is outside and inside.

Trust

Building trust between members and with community facilitators increases group efficiency and enables conflict resolution.

Exchange

The community recognizes forms of exchange values, such as knowledge, experience, support, barter or money .

Expression

 

The community itself has a “soul” or “personality”; members are aware of what other community members are doing.

History

The community must keep track of past events and must react and change in response to it.

heterarchy

technological constraints on organisational structure [e.g. distance and time] are changing

There is as yet no new social framework that is as interesting as technology, and ideas, now allow.

a new dominant form of social organisation

“It is the shift from hierarchy to heterarchy, which is still in progress worldwide. (“Heterarchy” was coined by early cybernetician Warren McCulloch at MIT to designate networked structures in which the center of control constantly moves to wherever is most relevant and useful; he was thinking of brain function.) At a time when the New Left was calling for grass-roots political (I.e. referred) power, Whole Earth eschewed politics and pushed grass-roots direct power – tools and skills.” Stewart Brand on founding the Whole Earth Catalog in 1968

the network is the new dominant form of social organisation

the emphasis [...] is less on the advance of technology than on the challenges for organization”

netwar is not simply a function of the Internet; it does not take place only in cyberspace or the infosphere. Some key battles may occur there, but a war’s overall conduct and outcome will normally depend mostly on what happens in the real world.”

Netwar is not Internet war.

the information revolution is not solely or mainly about technology; it is an organizational as well as a techno-logical revolution.

Consider the four major forms that, over the ages, appear to account for the organization and evolution of societies: tribes, institutions, markets, and networks (see Ronfeldt, 1996). Very different types of information – and different information cultures and strategies – pertain to each form. In the case of tribes (and clans), the most valued information is often about kinship ties; in the case of institutions, it is about the reasons for hierarchy; in markets, it is about opportunities for exchange; and, while it is still early to be sure about information-age networks, information about the capacity for team-work may be highly valued.

The rise of network forms of organization is a key consequence of the ongoing information revolution.

[Four examples of network organisation

• The chain network, as in a smuggling chain where people, goods, or information move along a line of separated contacts, and where end-to-end communication must travel through the intermediate nodes.

• The star, hub, or wheel network, as in a franchise or a cartel structure where a set of actors is tied to a central node or actor, and must go through that node to communicate and coordinate.

• The all-channel network, as in a collaborative network of militant small groups where every group is connected to every other.

Of the three network types, the all-channel has been the most difficult to organize and sustain historically, partly because it may require dense communications

In an archetypal netwar, the protagonists may consist of diverse, dispersed, often small groups (“nodes”) who share a set of ideas and interests, and agree to communicate, coordinate, and act in a highly Internetted (“all-channel”) manner. Ideally, this actor (or set of actors) has no single central leadership, headquarters, or command - no precise heart or head that can be targeted. The overall organizational design is flat and non-hierarchical - it is heterarchical, both polycephalous and acephalous. It functions as what might be termed a “panarchy” in that all members subscribe to a common doctrine that reflects their shared ideals and objectives, and guides their strategies. Tactical decision making and operations are decentralized - they may involve mutual consultation, but they emphasize local initiative.

society as shelter

“our increased dependence on technological shelter may lead to the weakening of human interdependence, which is another source of security. We should not forget that society too provides shelter, and in many cases a more flexible and effective kind.” Rosalind Williams - Notes from the Underground

domestication of grains made possible living in cities

“As ancient as wine is, however, beer is probably older, as attested by brewers Slops found on Neolithic middens. As Edgar Anderson says, man was a brewer before he was a baker. Some believe that brewing was the impetus behind the domestication of grains. The domestication of grains made possible living in cities, and it was living in cities that made possible imperialism, police, and slavery, which, in turn, led to writing, which led to, well, we all know: our present dilemma.

Ale comes from the Indo-European root alu-, relating to magic, sorcery, possesion and visions, and is cognate with our word hallucinogen”

peer to peer companies, klogs and blogcliques

here are commercial companies trawling and targeting blogs and selling what they find to corporate clients

this ultimately is one of the directions the knowledge management / klogs threads point

use the free stuff to make some money

seems like bloggers need a license or a mechanism that ensures that their writing is attributed and their contribution gets paid for if it is used in a commercial context.

ridiculously utopian to imagine everyone doing their thing, and getting paid if what they do gets exploited commercially

even so

creative commons as it stands is not enough

one alternative is companies like Sense who allow bright people to blog amongst themselves for the benefit of commercial clients

..another alternative is the decentralised company

the difference being: rather than either the suited trawlers or net­worked consultants model..

you have an active open coalition of openly (and privately) blog­ging individuals focused on a shared purpose

in the context of ‘free and open’ this is the open source model

but in a commercial context

all this feeds into the nagging feeling that variant forms of all these ideas are already well advanced

and there are some dark undertones already evident

its not a new thought that bloggers and blogrollers are the end­game in advertising

bloggers with an audience can [and to varying degrees do] sell their voices [mentioning products and individuals and compa­nies apparently in the context of a subjective open dialogue but primarilly to serve the individual, interest group or company they have a financial or other interest in serving]

this is the full on blur that guerrilla advertising seeks:

targeted advertising in the context of an apparently ‘open subjec­tive dialogue’ is heavy duty hypnotic suggestion

no need for indicators, no requirement for a break in the discourse indicating ‘advert for individual/company/ideology follows..’

its not as simple as it seems either

you want to get paid cos you’re hungry [example deleted] or you need another titanium imac [example deleted]

you want to talk in public cos you understand that you’re going to get the feedback you need to push your own ideas forward if you place them in the biggest open technically sophisticated network forum possible

so what to do?

get on with it

read critically

keep working

blogging really is doing for text and ideas what open sourcing has done for software

blogs are not just public diaries they are mechanisms for structur­ing thoughts and ideas so they can be ordered, searched, aggre­gated and trawled

look what open source (with its often contrasting and diverse motivations) has managed to drag into a world a lot of people tried to keep closed

[..but maybe think about this stuff]

..and then there’s the politics of blogcliques that coalesce and exist only to keep each other permanently overflowing with links back and forth [to be fair: often a mix of reasonable talent and machiavellian instincts]

the blogclique is disticnct from the blogroll because blogcliquer’s are making sure they all get paid and stay in the news, industry pundits, journalists, industry insiders, freeloaders and hardworkers alliied with a common goal – not to disappear from view

[begin paulo valdemarin P2P companies quote. via Ben Hammer­sley]

“Along all the .com era, all new companies that have been created were after all “traditional” companies, meaning pyramidal struc­tures with managers, employees, offices, etc.

In the last few months I have met (most of times virtually) some very smart people from all parts of the world I would like to work with: to start new projects, to create new technologies, to develop new solutions. But when I think about how this could work out, I

keep bumping in the same old “company” idea. We could work together, with the ultimate goal of creating a new company.

But is this really the way to go? With the kind of collaborative tech­nology that we have today, do we really still need companies?

Well, of course, the answer from many points of view is still yes, but it could be a whole new breed of company: a P2P company.

It could be something between a secret society, where all mem­bers are somehow guaranteed by other members and are sup­posed to help each other (of course, this should not be secret!), eBay, where everybody has a “digital reputation” (co-workers and customers commenting on different members of the group) and a true P2P network, where everybody is both a client and a server (there’s just people working together, not necessarily anybody is working for anybody else).”

“the human propensity for noticing outliers in statistically opaque data.

it turns out this is a phenonema that people who appreciate music are quite familiar with. you will be listening to a song, and then you will hear a very faint hint of a new direction in the melody – your ears amplify these outliers and soon you are waiting for it to really pick up…

the point is that it is not major trends that people necessarily listen for; but hints at novelty – and a blogging scavenging busi­ness would likely do quite well… could affiliate with some of the venture capital firms, and make strong efforts to make people aware that they will be credited for their concepts.

howard rheingold barcode observation

“My friend Marc Smith, a sociologist-geek who works for Microsoft Research, has connected an inexpensive barcode scanner to a handheld computer with a wireless connection, and has installed code that connects the info returned from the universal product code database to the Google search engine. The UPC database provides salient information about the product linked to a bar code. It’s all part of AURA , a research project to explore ubiquitous computing using off-the-shelf technology. People who register at the site can send their scans . and their comments on their scans . to a website. Their comments thus turn up within days, open to everyone with Google access, as results of keyword searches relevant to the scanned object.

So what does that mean in practice? I went in his kitchen and scanned the first two objects I found . a box of prunes and a box of breakfast cereal. Then I googled the names of the products and the names of their vendors, as revealed by the barcodes. The first link to the prune growers , the Sun-Diamond Growers cooperative of California , was to a political polemic about “Bromide Barons attempting to undermine the democratic process with their financial influence.” The “Corpwatch” was clearly a political group with an agenda. However, the second link revealed the syllabus of a Supreme Court decision against Sun-Diamond ; the first line of the syllabus states: “Respondent trade association was charged with violating, inter alia, 18 U.S.C. ¤ 201(c)(1)(A), which prohibits giving .anything of value. to a present, past, or future public official .for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by such public official..” I

Amazing! But perhaps an anomaly. The second item I scanned, however, was “Kellogg’s Cracklin Oat Bran.” The first entry in Google’s list of links was headlined: “Kellogg USA Issues Allergy Alert on Undeclared Eggs, Milk, Soybeans, or Almonds in Kellogg’s® Cracklin’ Oat Bran® and Kellogg’s® Smart Start® Cereals.” Talk about your sentient things! As Marc says, “every thing has a story.”

Labels on products reflect political decisions, often influenced by enormous economic forces. Witness the current battles over labelling foods that contain genetically-modified organisms. A product label is a closed system. The barcode, which links products to the machines that sort, track, and organize the distribution of the products, is connected to another closed system, the UPC database, which is open to public inspection but not public modification. However, when you apply Google searches to the information returned from the UPC database, the closed system is pried open by its connection to a vast open system of documents, links, comments, and debates from public records, websites, and usenet postings. Citizens and consumers have been relatively powerless in regard to influencing the kind and amount of information revealed on product labels. A few off-the-shelf technologies, costing a few hundred dollars, some custom code, and a universally available web utility, threatens to upset this crucial balance of information-power.

‘We are interested to study emergent individual and group behaviors associated with the ability to digital tag objects and places. In our system, a user can associate text, threaded conversations, audio, images, video or other data with a specific tag. Users can review the tags they have encountered and annotated in a custom web portal. Optionally, they can opt to have their comments be posted onto newsgroups. This allows search engines to index and essentially publish the association to other users. Physical annotations can be shared with other users and be rated by the users. reputation statistics. ‘”

corporations as robots

Corporations are created by humans to further the goal of making money. As Buckminster Fuller said in his brilliant essay The Grunch of Giants, “Corporations are neither physical nor metaphysical phenomena. They are socioeconomic ploys – legally enacted game-playing…”

Corporations are non-living, non-breathing, legal fictions. They feel no pain. They don’t need clean water to drink, fresh air to breathe, or healthy food to consume. They can live forever. They can’t be put in prison. They can change their identity or appearance in a day, change their citizenship in an hour, rip off parts of themselves and create entirely new entities. Some have compared corporations with robots, in that they are human creations that can outlive individual humans, performing their assigned tasks forever.

Isaac Asimov, when considering a world where robots had become as functional, intelligent, and more powerful than their human creators, posited three fundamental laws that would determine the behavior of such potentially dangerous human-made creations. His Three Laws of Robotics stipulated that non-living human creations must obey humans yet never behave in a way that would harm humans.

Asimov’s thinking wasn’t altogether original: Thomas Jefferson and James Madison beat him to it by about 200 years.

Jefferson and Madison proposed an 11th Amendment to the Constitution that would “ban monopolies in commerce,” making it illegal for corporations to own other corporations, banning them from giving money to politicians or trying to influence elections in any way, restricting corporations to a single business purpose, limiting the lifetime of a corporation to something roughly similar to that of productive humans (20 to 40 years back then), and requiring that the first purpose for which all corporations were created be “to serve the public good.”

The amendment didn’t pass because many argued it was unnecessary: Virtually all states already had such laws on the books from the founding of this nation until the Age of the Robber Barons.

..from a recent article by Thom Hartmann

community

community can be seen in the context of families, tribes, coun­tries, federations of countries, continents, or a commonly held idea. Commercial, military and political units can be thought of as separate to or bound up with the communities they serve or are aligned to.

..what constitutes a community is a classification problem

classification

..evolutionary biology really began as a science concerned with classification from Aristotle’s legacy. What is so beautiful today, is that the whole thing is being turned on its head. All of a sudden, evolutionary biologists, particularly those concerned with more theoretical work, are questioning our ability to define, name, or classify even the most fundamental things. For example, there are at least a dozen different species concepts in use. Systemetists [biologists concerned with classifying living organisms] cannot even agree on what a species is. And this is not because they are being limited or petty. It is because, knowing what we know about the world today, there is a philosophical problem with deciding where to draw species borders. You may disagree and argue that a lion is clearly different than a bobcat so that the argument must be purely theoretical. However, there are such practical concerns that come out of the species concept debate that it is impossible to dismiss it as a purely philosophical concern. The most important application of this work is in the area of conservation biology – where it is essential to come to some consensus about what is or is not actually unique and worth protecting. [This gets into a bunch of other things. One is about whether we should be protecting genetic or morphological diversity [a discussion that didn’t exist 50 years ago]. The other is about how we make sense of the fact that human and chimp genomes are only 5% different while identical looking salamander species have more than 14% divergence. I’ll spare you the details because I’m already rambling.]””There are a bunch of central dichotomies which evolutionary biologists are working through. I won’t give specific example for each now, but they give rise to very practical issues [in addition to the theoretical]. I list them for you just to illustrate that I think evolutionary biology can act as quite a bridge between technology and philosophy. Erica Rosenblum

Security and privacy through encryption should arguably be discussed in terms of a right rather than as a feature (hotmail etc. should be private and secure).

As borders and boundaries become a principal concern of real communities, so encryption is becoming a concern for networked communities. As mobile devices evolve to the point where they are by default broadcasting your location at any given moment, encryption becomes a clear synonym for security and privacy. Encryption will be a defining factor in the evolution of new forms of spatialised networked community.

“’The mandarins draw their power from the law; the people from the secret societies.’ — Chinese saying

[secret societies in software]

Last winter I read a book on the Chinese Tongs (Primitive Revolutionaries of China: A Study of secret Societies in the Late Nineteenth Century, Fei-Ling Davis; Honolulu, 1971- 77): – maybe the first ever written by someone who wasn’t a British Secret Service agent! – (in fact, she was a Chinese socialist who died young – this was her only book) – & for the first time I realized why I’ve always been attracted to the Tong: not just for the romanticism, the elegant decadent chinoiserie decor, as it were – but also for the form, the structure, the very essence of the thing.

Some time later in an excellent interview with William Burroughs in Homocore magazine I discovered that he too has become fascinated with Tongs & suggests the form as a perfect mode of organization for queers, particularly in this present era of shitheel moralism & hysteria. I’d agree, & extend the recommendation to all marginal groups, especially ones whose jouissance involves illegalism (potheads, sex heretics, insurrectionists) or extreme eccentricity (nudists, pagans, post-avant-garde artists, etc., etc.).

A Tong can perhaps be defined as a mutual benefit society for people with a common interest which is illegal or dangerously marginal – hence, the necessary secrecy. Many Chinese Tongs revolved around smuggling & tax-evasion, or clandestine self-control of certain trades (in opposition to State control), or insurrectionary political or religious aims (overthrow of the Manchus for example – several tongs collaborated with the Anarchists in the 1911 Revolution).

A common purpose of the tongs was to collect & invest membership dues & initiation fees in insurance funds for the indigent, unemployed, widows & orphans of deceased members, funeral expenses, etc. In an era like ours when the poor are caught between the cancerous Scylla of the insurance industry & the fast-evaporating Charybdis of welfare & public health services, this purpose of the Secret Society might well regain its appeal. (Masonic lodges were organized on this basis, as were the early & illegal trade unions & “chivalric orders’ for laborers & artisans.)

Another universal purpose for such societies was of course conviviality, especially banqueting – but even this apparently innocuous pastime can acquire insurrectionary implications. In the various French revolutions, for example, dining clubs frequently took on the role of radical organizations when all other forms of public meeting were banned.”

real communities brought together or sustained by the net

People find themselves bringing their network life into their real life.

 

conferences as temporary communities

conferences are a part of a lot of people’s lives. They represent the artificial physical convergence of an often internationally dis­persed group that share a common interest.

Conferences are slightly weird and dislocated. Kind of like they’re not supposed to be happening.

They are a model for the idea of building your community around common interest rather than proximity or pre-existent relations and then managing to drag that community into the same room.

new architecture

reality augmented

In real space, outside, people will soon find their worlds radically reinterpreted and augmented by a new generation of wireless networked location aware devices.

 

Location awareness will change the way people relate to the space, orientate them in that space, and help them find what they need.

It is now possible (and it will become progressively easier) to invisibly mark, demarcate and annotate real spaces. This makes possible a new architecture.

path and place

[EDGES]

J.G. Davies states that ‘most buildings belong to either the category of path or that of a place, the one suggesting journey and movement , the other a centre and stillness … between these two main categories there are structures that combine features of both: such are paths that lead to and include places, the latter acting as foci or nodes.’

[Lynch states] ‘For a path to be identifiable, it must have strong edges; continuity; directionality; recognisable landmarks a sharp terminal; and end-from-end distinction.’

Davies goes on to define place as ‘a readily comprehensible shape’ that possesses a discernable and ‘concentrated’ form with ‘pronounced borders.’ The place needs to be ‘limited in size,’ ‘capable of being experienced as an inside in contrast to the surrounding exterior; largely non-directional’ and to provide a ‘focus for gathering’.

“all architecture is a structuring of space by means of a goal or path” Dagoburt Frey.

Norberg-Schulz also references Lynch and lists his own terms regarding path and place: “directions or paths”, “centres or places” and “areas or domains”

Moreover, paths represent the willful leaving of one place and a journey to another

He cites the cosmogonic implications the path and place have held for ancient societies; the centre or place representing the centre of the world and the path leading away from this;

“the way is always directed from the known to the unknown.”

“man is both centre bound and horizon bound” Aldo van Eyck

real space [outside versus inside] [augmenting reality vs simulating it]

So far computers have kept people indoors sitting in front of screens. The latest stage in computer evolution will see the next generation of kids running through the space with networked location aware computers [with short acronyms] strapped to them. These devices will make the space more interesting as they run, issuing instructions like Get to the end of the road and climb on the roof of the deserted cinema (for some unspecified future net­worked game related purpose).

Computer games that use and augment real space will probably result in a few deaths but at least it’ll get kids out of the house and running around climbing things.

Augmentation is about to become a more interesting mass market problem than pure simulation. The market is orders of magnitude larger than the ghetto that is 3d gaming.

A range of new conceptual and design related problems are implied by augmenting real space.

Many of the more interesting augmentation problems relate to building new spaces and reinterpreting old ones.

Arguably these are problems for architects.

More likely they are problems for kids. If kids get there hands on these devices and prove receptive to them, then just by watch­ing how they use them, it will become apparent what the devices are capable of and to what unforeseen uses that can be put.

abstraction and empty space

A bald patch of grass on Wimbledon common may become impor­tant to some as yet non-existent community, and even as the community grows in size and importance, it may be unnecessary to build anything on that spot to emphasis its collective importance either to the community itself or to other communities.

Imagine if there were no billboards, no one wore bright colors or fashionable clothes, the buildings were all spartan and utilitarian, there were no street signs, none of the houses had numbers, and shops had no shopfronts just doors. The entire life of the culture not visible without some kind of technological augmentation. All colour and information was invisible to the naked eye.

city images

“There seems to be a public image of any given city which is the overlap of many individual images. Or perhaps there is a series of public images, each held by some significant number of citizens. Such group images are necessary if an individual is to operate successfully within his environment and to cooperate with his fellows. Each individual picture is unique, with some content that is rarely or never communicated, yet it approximates the

 

public image, which, in different environments, is more or less compelling, more or less embracing.

[...]

[mental maps of spaces]

the closer he looks, the more vague and smudged it all becomes

[...]

These environments are not only highly meaningful, but their image is a vivid one.

Certain holy areas may become very highly charged, so that there is a strong focusing of attention, a fine differentiation of parts, a high density of names. The Athenian Acropolis, saturated with a long cultural and religious history, was evidently named and parceled to the gods small area by small area, almost stone by stone, making renovations extremely difficult. The Emily Gap, a small gorge 100 yards long by 30 yards wide in the MacDonnell ranges of central Australia, is to the native people a veritable gallery of legendary locations. In Tikopia, the Marae, a sacred cleared space in the forest was used ritually only once a year. It was a small rectangle, yet contained over twenty locations with regular fixed names. Among more advanced Cultures an entire city may be holy, such as Meshed in Iran, or Lhasa in Tibet. These cities are full of names and memories, distinctive forms, and holy places.

[...]

there is a pleasant sense of familiarity or rightness in a recognised landscape. The Netsilik Eskimo put this well-worn idea in their own way: “to be surrounded by the smell of ones own things”

[...]

Indeed the very naming and distinguishing of the environment vivifies it, and thereby adds to the depth and poetry of the human experience.

[...]

[Florence] Progressive house numbering was introduced in 1808, and the city shifted over to reference by paths.

aborigines

Aborigines, choose not to reshape the land in the ways that other cultures tend to, and instead rely on and interact with an incred­ibly complex internalised map of their environment, one that is extended through a shared oral tradition of mapping through song, the mapping having application to religious and spiritual practice, territorial boundaries, and practical requirements for food, water and shelter.

wayfinding

Field biologists are tagging and tracking all manner of species, mapping Monarch butterflies as they all head down to Mexico from Canada and then turn left to converge on a specific spot.

They speculate that whales are telling stories to the younger whales to help them as they migrate across vast stretches of ocean.

Analysis of dolphin communication based on techniques derived from information theory show that in dolphin dolphin interactions, the amount of information that can be or is being transferred, the bandwidth, is far higher than speech based human to human communication.

Whales and dolphins and chimpanzees don’t expend enormous effort building houses and reshaping and marking their external environment

Having a sophisticated model of territory, physical and social, and using that model in a sophisticated way does not necessarily require you to mark or alter it.

Humans appear to be on the verge of transferring much of the information that they had previously physically engraved directly onto the environment, into a more abstract and invisible form.

If marking is a question of degree, then moving a large part of the information people have become accustomed to physically attach­ing to the space into portable devices represents a definite shift in the balance.

the discovery of culture in other animals

“If culture is defined by socially (as opposed to genetically) transmitted habits and knowledge, so that one group may develop quite different ways of doing things from another group of the same species, It is widespread indeed.” Frans de Waal

brutus

Brutus was the leader of a community of eighty chimpanzees. Like other communities, parties of around ten would go off in search of food, often travelling in one direction for hours in silence. These travelling parties would keep in touch by pant-hooting and by drumming on trees with buttresses, which are very resonant and can be heard for thousands of metres through the forest. Boesch noticed that sometimes after he had heard drumming, all the parties in the community would change direction. Many months of patiently following the community made Boesch realize that it was only when Brutus was drumming that the community changed direction. Analysis of the drumming and the reactions to it led Boesch, a famously careful researcher, to the astonishing conclusion that Brutus was signalling to his community in a ‘symbolic drumming code’ based on the number of drumbeats. Brutus conveyed three completely specific messages:

1. Drumming once at two different trees indicated the direction he was proposing, which was the direction followed by Brutus when moving between the two drummed trees.

2. Drumming twice at the same tree meant rest for an hour. The community activity stopped for an average of 60 minutes. In twelve observed instances, the rest was never less than 55 minutes and never more than 65 minutes. Once Boesch observed Brutus drumming four times on the same tree, and the party

 

rested for 2 hours!

3. Drumming once at one tree and twice on another tree meant change direction to the one proposed, and then rest for an hour.’

For this form of communication to work, Brutus and other members must be able to use their numerical capacity to distinguish 1, 1 from 2 from 1, 2. This code is only found in this one community in the Tai Forest: it was part of their culture and no one else’s. I say ‘was’ because Brutus has now stopped using the code. Poaching, the greatest threat to chimpanzee survival, has killed or kidnapped so many prime males that the number of travel parties has since declined dramatically.

the mathematical brain by Brian Butterworth, papermac 1999

the landscape serves as a vast mnemonic system [and plays a social role]

Way-finding is the original function of the environmental image, and the basis on which its emotional associations may have been founded. But the image is valuable not only in this immediate sense in which it acts as a map for the direction of movement; in a broader sense as a general frame of reference within which the individual can act, or to which he can attach his knowledge. In this way it is like a body of belief, or set of social customs: it is an organiser of facts and possibilities.

[...]

At other times, distinguishing and patterning the environment may be a basis for the ordering of knowledge. Rattray speaks with great admiration of the Ashanti medicine men who strove to know every plant, animal, and insect in their forests by name, and to understand the spiritual properties of each. They were able to “read” their forests as a complex and ever-unfolding document.

The landscape plays a social role as well. The named environment, familiar to all, furnishes material for common memories and symbols which bind the group together and allow them to communicate with one another. The landscape serves as a vast mnemonic system for the retention of group history and ideals

[...]

[Sapir] He goes on to note that the characteristic Indian vocabulary does not contain the English lumping-word, “weeds,” but has separate terms for these sources of food arid medicine, terms which for each species distinguish whether the specimen is raw or cooked, as well is its color and stage of growth: as in the English calf, cow, bull, veal, and beef.

Yung makes an interesting reference to a trained geologist who was able to march unhesitatingly through foggy alpine country, simply by recognition of the patterning of the geologic type of the exposed rocks.

mental maps

People build complex internalised mental maps of the spaces they live in.

If a boy or a girl needs to get home late at night they have paths and places, boundaries and borders in their heads, relating not just to the bare facts of the space, but linked to other factors such as, what and where they consider safe.

So much of persons map of a space is influenced by, imposed cultural associations, territorial associations, what they need to get done, and past experience. The space itself serves to inform and trigger these associations intentionally or unintentionally.

If these individual internal maps could be formalised, externalised, shared and collectively extended..

..it would radically change the way people relate, both to the space around them and the people around them.

[mine human geography, anthropology, psychology and biology for these maps]

Tony Hiss in ‘the experience of place’ notes the inertia inherent in internal image of the external environment; the internal model only changes if we are aware that a change has occurred. It is now possible exists to digitally link these subjective maps and feed­back changes to individual.

pilgrim

[MYTH]

Levi Strauss held that the underlying structure of myth was consistent [something that could be proved with diagrams...]

Architecture as built myth

The hero departs, passes through a number of trials, attains the goal or destination, and returns spiritually transformed.

[...]

the hero [pilgrim] retreats… “…from the world scene of secondary effects to those causal zones of the psyche where the difficulties really exist … His second solemn task and deed therefore … is to return then to us, transfigured, and teach the lesson he has learned of life renewed.” Joseph Campbell

The hero’s journey is characterised by the sequence of ‘separation, initiation, and return,’ in which the pilgrim experiences a rite of passage and emerges, in most cases, spiritually transformed.

According to Eliade, in traditional societies if a man or woman is to become ‘complete’, they must be born for a second time. ‘Access to spiritual life always entails death to the profane condition, followed by a new birth.’ Ones childlike self dies and one returns as an adult. Initiatory rites typically perform the function of a rite of passage from one mode of being to another.

“I want to depart from here today and achieve the deathless state” [The Buddha leaves home]

..death and a journey to the underworld are a common mythological theme..

The rite of pilgrimage, analogous to the spiritual journey, is found in all the world’s major religions. [an integral part of christianity, islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism]

The act of pilgrimage has always centred on the individual.

Richard Barber cites anthropological studies that suggest pilgrimage replaced initiation rites of traditional societies, of which preparation, separation, and return in a changed state are an essential part.

The goal [of the pilgrimage], the sacred place, through its architecture, often created a microcosm of the pilgrimage. An internalised world was created in which the pilgrim’s journey is reenacted in the architectural setting ø the spiritual path and place.

wooden cathedrals

[stone cathedrals made of wood]

“First of all, wood was the foundation of its building.

All the elaborate masonry forms were dependent upon the work of the carpenter: it was not merely that the piers themselves, in the later gothic construction, resembled

tree trunks laced together

or that

the filtered light within the church had the dimness of the forest,

while the effect of the bright glass was like that of the blue sky or a sunset seen through the tracery of branches:

the fact is that none of this construction was possible without an elaborate falsework of wood: nor without wooden cranes and windlasses could the stones have been conveniently raised the necessary heights.”

Lewis Mumford

ritual

[RITUAL]

The sacred place is a place apart, separated from the profane world

a place where God or gods are worshiped and rituals enacted.

Examples range from a simple clearing in the forest to complex architectural settings.

an ‘axis mundi’, a place where the three regions of the world ø heaven, earth, and the underworld ø were joined.

Consequently, it was a place where communication with God was possible, as we find in the dream of Jacob at Bethel, where there is a ladder ascending to heaven and the voice of the Lord offers prophecies. “How awesome this place!” says Jacob upon awakening. “This is none other than the house of God and this is the gate of heaven” (Gen. 18.17)

The path to the sacred place [...] often recreates the pilgrim’s journey and its three components of preparation, separation and return. Typically, there is a delineation of entry, a place of decision as to whether to start the journey or not. This threshold also establishes what may be the first of many points of separation between the sacred and the profane, and generally involves some kind of ritualistic shedding of the outside world, as in ablution. The entrance gains access to the path or to an entire enclosed sacred precinct. Typically following the entrance, there is a sequence of defined spaces, places, or events along the path that grow increasingly more sacred, often including a number of choices. A spatial sequence provides a symbolic narrative as one travels along it and increasingly anticipates the arrival at and attainment of the sacred place.

The sacred place shares similar qualities, such as a clearly defined entry or threshold to the inner sanctum, which performs

 

functions similar to the entrance to the path. The sacred place itself is a clearly defined enclosure that has precise boundaries and is separated from the outside profane world.

“Public architecture at best aspires to be just this: a setting for the ritual that makes of each user, for a brief moment, a larger person than he or she is in daily life” Spiro Kostof

a symbolic narrative facilitated by the architectural setting

“a ritual is an enactment of myth” Joseph Campbell

Rituals also symbolises a return to promordial time or ‘in illo tempore’ the Golden Age, a time when the gods were present and the religious myths were initially enacted. Similar to sacred space, sacred time is perceived as an interval in the surrounding profane time.”

The place took the form of increasingly enclosed and sacred places, culminating in the dense, dark, and small inner sanctum

synaesthesia through augmentation

Augmented senses combined with synaesthetic inter­faces may mean you can see the phone ring or the temperature change.

simulation and augmentation

There are new companies that specialise in simu­lating real world physics on low-end platforms.

Made up primarily of postgraduate mathematicians and physicists rather than game hackers, they simulate rigid body dynamics, cloth, smoke and fluids. They can breathe life into the sterile jointed wireframe shapes that are produced by 3d modeling packages, making 3D game worlds more lifelike.

[Beyond this, in the longer term, physics models may help you judge the best moment to cross the road or make it harder to crash your car. Tomorrow’s augmenting devices may well be 3d capable. 3d models of critical systems (like the engine of your car) may overlay your view of the real mechanism.]

A-life, AI and autonomous agent research is providing creatures of varying intelligence and behaviour to inhabit rich 3d space.

Current 3d capable game consoles, as well as the machines that Sony and Microsoft already plan to replace them with, are fast enough to simulate a very high level of realism and natural behav­iour in real time.

Cheap high bandwidth internet connections, both wireless and cable, are now available to the consumer mass markets of Europe and America.

Even without these advances internet users have already become used to multi-user 3d gaming over networks.

People will inhabit rich and lifelike 3d environments in gaming and other contexts.

Companies have developed high-resolution retinal displays. These displays use lasers to project an image directly onto the retina. These devices overlay computer generated images onto real spaces. Retinal displays small enough to clip on to a pair of glasses will soon be mass market products.

All the creatures, tools and techniques of 3d gaming and simula­tion can find there way into the real space.

[You can already play quake in real spaces]

The future looks likely to see reality ever more accurately simu­lated, and that simulation looks likely to find a way into real life.

storytelling

Kris Griffith of Io research in san francisco and Fiona Raby at the RCA in London, are both architects who have found themselves designing interfaces for location aware devices. In separate conversations they both focused on the storytelling possibilities of location aware devices.

On one level storytelling is a good metaphor for thinking about both the way people move through space, and the capacity to influence their movements. On another more literal level, through location aware games, users can become characters in collective stories that unfold as people get close to one another, or move to and through particular spaces.

Location awareness also adds another dimen­sion to the patchwork built up from surveillance camera footage, click history, credit card stubs, camcorder footage, phone conversations etc. ..you could tell the story of someones ordinary day using all this stuff

..spatial maps of films: where do the characters go? ..do they stay in a confined area or travel (linear or circular?)

dunne and raby

In san francisco and silicon valley hackers sit on roofs and in car parks and and use wireless ethernet cards and laptops to find their way on to the wireless networks of companies close by. That this happens points out a kind of weird blindness by the compa­nies to the spatial nature of their networks ..they are not thinking that these networks map spatially in a new way.

Fiona Raby and her partner Tony Dunne have worked on map­ping electromagentic fields onto space. The maps they create link directly to location awareness when this idea is applied to cell phone towers. The tower a cell phone is using at any given moment roughly indicates a users position in space. The cover­age area of a tower is affected by factors such as distance from the tower and whether there are buildings between the tower and the user. The buildings create shadows which diminish coverage; so that in urban environments with a lot of buildings there is a far higher density of cell phone towers than in non-urban environ­ments. The spatial footprint of a cell phone tower is different in urban and non-urban environments.

 

According to Raby people actually pull the cell they are using with them until another cell becomes sufficiently strong to take over ..this makes for beautiful fluid visualisations..

artist engineering

“The artist of the late medieval period and the Renaissance was, also, the architect and engineer of his day and so necessarily mathematically inclined. Businessmen, secular priests, and ecclesiastical officials assigned all construction problems to the artist. He designed and built churches, hospitals, palaces, cloisters, bridges, fortresses, drawings of such engineering projects are in da Vinci’s notebooks and he, himself, in offering his services to Ludovico Sforza, ruler of Milan, promised to serve as an engineer, constructor of military works, and designer of war machines, as well as architect, sculptor and painter. The artist was even expected to solve problems involving the motion of canon balls in artillery fire, a task which in those times called for profound mathematical knowledge.” [lost the reference]

walk home

The balancing of the natural and the human-made, the forest and the path, the dark with the light, the compressed with the open, suggests the harmony that geomancy sought to attain. The path to the subtemple also describes a journey from yin to yang, the taoist principle so influential in Zen. The dark, earthy path through the forest yielding to the light, human-made environment of the dojo. Both elements were balanced, creating Harmonious environment ø earth balanced with sky.

Thomas Barrie – ‘spiritual path, sacred place’ Shambhala

magical associations can inhibit if they lack flexibility

The creation of the environmental image is a two-way process between observer and observed, What he sees is based on exterior form, but how he interprets and organizes this, and how he directs his attention, in its turn affects what he sees. The human organism is highly adaptable and flexible, and different groups may have widely different images of the same outer reality.

[...]

A landscape loaded with magical meanings may inhibit practical activities, The Arunta face death rather than move to a more favorable area. The ancestral grave-mounds in China occupy desperately needed arable land, and among the Maori some of the best landing-places are forbidden because of their mythical import. Exploitation is more easily accomplished where there is no sentiment about the land. Even conservative use of resources may be impaired where habitual orientation does not allow easy adaptation to new techniques and needs.

[...]

If it is desirable that an environment evoke rich, vivid images, it is also desirable that these images be communicable and adaptable to changing practical needs, and that there can develop new groupings, new meanings, new poetry. The objective might be an imageable environment which is at the same time open-ended. [...]

definition of architecture

“Architecture: from the Latin -teks – To weave (as a net); also to fabricate, a root shared with text, textile, context, subtle (“the finest thread of the weave”) and technology. More especially, to build a dwelling, with tools.”

American Heritage Dictionary

a new form of parasitic architecture [augmentation as]

Soft augmentation, the ability to annotate and bound real spaces without physically altering them, is a new variant form of parasitic architecture. A structure that is dependent upon and augments an existing structure can be classified as parasitic architecture.

optimism in architecture

Architecture is less and less about buildings, but can continue to be about our relationship to real space.

human beings are nomadic at a very fundamental level

the act of ritual is symbolised by path and goal

ebb and flow and local routing

A central idea in human culture is the journey. A journey is a fundamental way in which we relate to space. We move from one place to another in a linear sequence. The idea of the journey is central to our myths and stories, it is encoded in our architec­ture and implied in our built environment, the streets outside our houses, the paths through the woods, the networks of freeways, the railway tracks through our towns, the airports on the outskirts of every city, the ports distributed along every coast.

These paths serve a logistic purpose, to move people and to move things. We can choose to stay relatively still and things will find there way to our communities. But even this stasis still involves journeys; to work, to school, to shop, to the next room.

Novels are linear jouneys, but even in a medium like the internet this linear idea persists, the way you experience hypertext is linear too, it just doesn’t constrain the way you navigate.

Human beings have limited ability to multitask, at least at a conscious level (Distraction), so that each shift in our attention aggregated becomes a journey.

mnemonic architectures

“You are here – a virtual somewhere possessing an identifiable (interiorized) form and mnemonic associations by which you have arrived, will leave, and (may) navigate to return. Functionally similar mnemonic architectures have existed for almost two thousand years,”

Darrel Berry, The Poetics of Cyberspace

psychological projection [its not really there]

Architecture projects meaning onto space through physical restructuring of our environment.

What if the same principles could be applied without remodelling the space, if path could be implied without a sequence of real col­umns, a sacred space could be implied without a real perimeter.

sacred space

A place in a local park or an arbitrary piece of sidewalk could be become a meeting place or a sacred space with meaning overlaid but invisible.

a locus is a place easily grasped by the memory

“A locus is a place easily grasped by the memory, such as a house, an intercolumnar space, a corner, an arch or the like.”

Darrel Berry, The Poetics of Cyberspace

the new world

“on the one hand he shared the practicality of the English school [...] on the other hand, he was imbued with the nonsense of hermetic philosophy.”

A.L. Rowse on Elizabethan mathematician John Dee

voyages of discovery

“The opening of the ‘new’ world was conceived from the start as an occultist operation. The magus John Dee, spiritual advisor to Elizabeth I, seems to have invented the concept of ‘magical imperialism’ and infected an entire generation with it. Halkyut and Raleigh fell under his spell, and Raleigh used his connections with the ‘School of Night’ a cabal of advanced thinkers, aristocrats, and adepts to further the causes of exploration, colonization and mapmaking. ‘The Tempest’ was a propaganda-piece for the new ideology, and the Roanoke Colony was its first showcase experiment.”

Hakim Bey

voyages, navigation and the extension of knowledge

“there was a close and continuing dialectic between the voyages and the extension of knowledge.”

A.L. Rowse

new worlds inspire hope and new ways of thinking

Virginia was conceived of along utopian lines

New worlds inspire hope and new ways of thinking. Voyages of discovery force advances in the technology required for such endeavours (navigation, map making etc.). If new worlds actu­ally appear, there qualities, there character and evidence of there existence affect the society which initiated the voyages, in intel­lectual and material ways.

The internet can be read as a new world and a new frontier, sub­ject to reports from settlers, evidence of its existence (webvans etc.), land grabs and economic and social impact.

New ways of seeing the world can be analogous to new worlds.

‘for a ship does not go into the seas of the opposite south without bringing back to the courts or academies evidence of those worlds.’

Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie

memory maps and symbol systems [organising and structuring]

organising and structuring through externalised interior constructs

memory, symbol systems and architecture

most architectures exhibit both process and mnemonic aspects

“A mnemonic architecture facilitates memory and desire, a cluster which seeks to cluster. A process architecture provides access to tools. Most architectures exhibit both process and mnemonic aspects, either together, or in varying spatial and temporal aspects – this shelter from the rain, this arbour in which I dream.”

Darrell Berry – The Poetics of Cyberspace

physical buildings function on many levels

Architecture is about utility, Corbusier contended that living spaces should be machines for living in.

Physical buildings function on many levels, and utility should be broadly defined: symbolic, narrative, mnemonic and aesthetic.

Buildings can be symbols of power, authority and permanence. Buildings prescribe journeys which you have to take in order to transition from one space to another. They can encode and refer­ence ideas and function. They can be beautiful.

clay grahams symbolic arrays

“A church is an excellent example of this, a symbolic array is created where the interaction between the symbols in that array holds greater value than the essence of any one of the symbols within that matrix.”

Clay Graham

a cathedral is a symbolic clearing in the woods

A cathedral is a symbolic clearing in the woods, sunlight through the tracery in the stained glass emulating light through branches. The columns are high and, like trees, arching up and spreading out. Ritual, symbolism, metaphor, mnemonic function converge in what were key medieval centers of power and administration.

using archetypes to convey the purpose of a space

Virtual Architecture uses archetypes to convey the purpose of the space. Archetypes are a low-level symbolic language, understood to be at the base of the human psyche, which the virtual architect uses to encode meaning. Ten archetypes are as follows:

AXIS: Infers a path to a goal and begs to be followed.

COURT: The focus of action/inaction and cognitive awareness, a container of thresholds.

RELATIONSHIP OF PATH AND PLACE: The journey begins at the first threshold (initiation) and ends at the final threshold (enlightenment)

PERIMETER OF DOMAIN: The limit of understanding, the limit of the defined world.

PORTAL: A breach in the perimeter: the mouth of an axis connecting two domains.

OPENNESS AND CLOSURE: Defined by the perimeter, openness is the lack of understanding and closure is the comfortable area of knowledge.

DATUM: Spatial datum defines the scale and perimeter of the space; secondary datum may define items of interaction and is offset to show importance.

COLUMN: defines the perimeter and sets the vertical scale.

WALL: The primary method of defining the perimeter; also provides closure and clarifies breaches or portals.

ROOF: Preserves the relationship of sky and ground and provides the elevation boundary for the area of interactivity

David Frerichs describes Clay Graham’s archetypal paradigm

temporary architecture

Architecture serves to organise and focus all the appropriate sym­bols, meanings, and functionality that the proposed purpose of the building dictates.

Qualified architects are already finding themselves in many other roles aside from pure builders of buildings. Interface design, web­site design, building temporary structures for transient events like festivals, conferences and trade shows, 3d design for computer games and simulation.

As the networked world becomes increasing overlaid upon, and integrated with, the real world, the new concept of augmented space will offer opportunities for redefining the boundaries of architecture.

Imagine if there were no billboards, no one wore bright colors or fashionable clothes, the buildings were all spartan and utilitarian, there were no street signs, none of the houses had numbers, and shops had no shopfronts just doors. The entire life of the culture not visible without some kind of technological augmentation. All colour and information was invisible to the naked eye.

Burning Man enforces a no money rule, no advertising, no specta­tors. When I was there in 1999, despite 25,000 people turning up, there were no concessions, no logos, no labels, no billboards. All the infrastructure and actual structures were temporary, including the airport and the 27 radio stations. The only food you had was what you hauled in from the outside or what you bartered for, and the only thing in the whole place you could buy was coffee or juice (carrot, apple and ginger). Weirdly enough this regime significantly and positively changed the atmosphere relative to analogous big gatherings. One guy came into a camp I was visiting and tried to exchange large amounts of drugs for a little food and something to drink, (an indication of value shifting in this artificial economy).

Symbol systems extend to the extreme utility of coherent address­ing, the numbering of houses, the naming of streets, the boundary markers that define villages, towns and districts.

In japan the streets are not numbered according to the western convention of beginning at the start of a block and increasing as you walk. They are numbered according to the age of the building, the oldest build­ing is the first. So if someone gives you an address that just states the street name and number it is effectively useless. Cell phones are essential if you want to find your way to an address you haven’t been to before.

Symbol systems can extend beyond conventional boundaries. symbols of approval and disapproval, support and opposition, descriptions of function and ritual attached to any arbitrary space, bespoke paths for individuals and communities parasitic on aggregated conventional common paths. Bespoke numbering and addressing systems.

The way the space is navigated, valued, and understood will change in the face of augmentation technologies.

the myths and rites constitute a mesocosm, a mediating, middle cosmos

“And if we now try to convey in a sentence the sense and meaning of all the myths and rituals that have sprung from this conception of a universal order, we may say that they are structuring agents, functioning to bring the human order into accord with the celestial. ‘Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.’ The myths and rites constitute a mesocosm – a mediating, middle cosmos, through which the microcosm of the individual is brought into relation to the macrocosm of the all.”

Joseph Campbell – The Masks of God

 

trees

“The tree is already the image of the world”

Deleuze and Guattari,1000 Plateaus

tree of life

The tree of life, the Tarot, objects and symbols of power all find there way into common cultural currency, witness the masonic motif on the US dollar bill.

Religion and mythology are filled with old stories which can help articulate new visions.

Mythology, Archetypes and Religion are constantly mined by con­temporary culture to encode, shed light on, and add authority to, new thoughts, new ways of thinking and new technologies.

[William Gibson used voodoo myth and symbolism mapped onto his dream of a networked world.]

Human culture is rich in this kind of symbolism and these kinds of dreams, they help to shape the internet already, everything is a metaphor for something in the real or mythological world, from daemons to trash cans.

Expect a new golden dawn.

‘the symbol cluster of the Quest’

how religions work

“That’s how religions work, a few people relate at first, the core of symbols then blossoms to incorporate new input.” Clay Graham

visualisation should help people interpret information

A modern map is an abstraction, an understood convention.

A visualisation of any given data is only useful if you understand what is being represented and why. Without elaborate explana­tion a vector field is only really useful to someone who is used to vector fields. A three dimensional surface map is useless unless you are used to interpreting data in this form. Stock market ana­lysts still prefer a sequence of bar graphs over three dimensional surface maps.

Visualisation should help people interpret information.

New languages, new conventions for abstraction, new kinds of visualisation integrated into our experience of space will change our conception of it.

the collective consciousness

“What did the backer hope to gain from it ? A leased line to the collective unconscious” Neal Stephenson, The Diamond Age

culture

“every culture lives within its dream” Lewis Mumford

cultures give shape to worlds

Cultures give shape to worlds, through shared symbolism, con­vention and meaning.

Massively extended choice in a media context (Cable TV, video, internet access etc.) mean that the social homogoneity that fol­lowed from collectively experienced limited choice broadcast media is breaking down.

But we still all see the same street signs, the same billboards, the same line down the middle of the road.

The ability of a small community to affect the way its members see and experience the space in which they live will mean an end to a commonly held view of that space.

simulation and politics

“all simulation is political” Ted Nelson

scientific annotation

Science, like religion and mythology is a source of observations, classification and modelling leading to interpretation. But unlike religion and mythology it has use beyond communication through metaphor and shared meaning.

Science and rationality applied to an augmentation system, might literally mean describing, modelling, predicting and interpreting the world as we experience it. The collective body of scientific knowledge at your disposal. Plants and animals might be anno­tated and described, physical systems might be modelled with a view to prediction.

the ability to think rationally is pretty rare

Neal Stephenson wrote a book about a young girl growing up in a future dominated by nano technology called The Diamond Age. In it he described a ‘book’, an intelligent nano-computer that

 

functioned as a tutor to the girl, it could teach it’s young reader all the concepts she needed to grasp, from the very simple to the very advanced, through a series of simulations and games, (e.g. escaping from a locked room in a castle requires working out the basic principles of a binary code).

Push Singh at MIT was working on the assumption that lan­guage is heavily linked to spatial metaphor (ted supports bill, Tina is close to joe etc.) and consequently an artificial intelligence approach to language can be developed within the context of a physically accurate 3d environment, you can learn language in the human sense better if you inhabit a 3d space governed by the laws of physics.

land [implicit boundaries]

implicit boundaries

He described to me how on holiday with his wife and children he arrived at a popular beach early to find it empty. For no particu­lar reason he used a bucket and spade to build a perimeter of sand castles 6 meters apart and 25 meters in diameter around his chosen spot. Through the course of the day, the beach filled up and yet no infringement of this unenforcable token boundary occurred.

Bums used to ride around the US on freight trains. They supple­mented this logistical network with a symbol system that they could use to communicate useful information to one another. A given symbol scrawled in chalk might mean something like ‘safe to sleep here’.

flowlines

“At this moment in the evolution of the Web, and considering our demands for the “face-to-face” and the sensual, we must consider the Web primarily as a support system, capable of carrying information from one Temporary Autonomous Zone to another, of defending the Temporary Autonomous Zone, rendering it ‘invisible’ or giving it teeth, as the situation might demand. But more than that: If the Temporary Autonomous Zone is a nomad camp, then the Web helps provide the epics, songs, genealogies and legends of the tribe; it provides the secret caravan routes and raiding trails which make up the flowlines of tribal economy; it even contains some of the very roads they will follow, some of the very dreams they will experience as signs and portents.”

“The despatialization of post-Industrial society provides some benefits (e.g. computer networking) but can also manifest as a form of oppression (homelessness, gentrification, architectural depersonalization, the erasure of Nature, etc.) The communes of the sixties tried to circumvent these forces but failed. The question of land refuses to go away. How can we separate the concept of space from the mechanisms of control? The territorial gangsters, the Nation/States, have hogged the entire map.”

Hakim Bey

 

land as a central tenet of modern power structures

Control of land and freedom of movement are traditional mea­sures of spatial power. Countries, borders, razor wire, check­points, property and prisons all reflect on how the space is subdivided and owned and how people are contained and controlled.

Borders are defined by historical conflict, political struggles, trea­ties and cartographers. Force of arms protects those borders.

The law (backed by force and political will) protects property rights within those borders and defines the way in which land is divided

The map is effectively closed, all land falls clearly under the jurisdiction and ownership of some state or other. There is no new world and no new frontier on the surface of the earth.

Augmenting and annotating reality will lead to a new conception of space, new ways of looking at land ownership, new kinds of com­munities and states.

Whole continents could be colonised over again without directly challenging the existing power structures, without people even being aware that it is happening.

civitas and urbs

“There is an old and useful distinction between the civic and the urban. Latin, as Fustel de Coulanges observed in his great work on the ancient city, distinguishes between the terms civitas and urbs. Families or tribes who joined together because they shared the same religious beliefs, social organization, form of government and modes of production created civitas – a community that was not necessarily related to any particular place or construction. But when such a unit chose a particular site and founded a city in which to dwell – as Rome was founded on the Seven Hills – an urban settlement resulted. So urban space became the territory of the civic formation, and civic principles determined the spatial configuration of the city. Choice of site, performance of the foundation ritual, and organization of the layout were seen as such fundamentally important acts that they were traditionally ascribed to the community’s gods and mythic heroes.”

temporary autonomous zones

Hakim Bey wrote a paper entitled ‘The Temporary Autonomous Zone’. It focuses on anarchist communities living in the gaps left by the dominant power in their domain. Assassins, pirates and the tongs. Communes, dining clubs and gatherings that serve as the anchor for all kinds of social groups and movements.

pirate networks

Pirate Utopias – The sea rovers and corsairs of the 18th century created an ‘information network’ that spanned the globe: primitive and devoted primarily to grim business, the net nevertheless functioned admirably. Scattered throughout the net were islands, remote hideouts where ships could be watered and provisioned, booty traded for luxuries and necessities. Some of these islands supported ‘intentional communities’, whole mini-societies living consciously outside the law and determined to keep it up, even if only for a short but merry life. [see texts like Daniel Defoe’s history of the pirates]

[No more space, no terra incognita. Computer networks are providing gaps in which anarchist communities can find abstracted spaces that can anchor their efforts to live differently. ]

The second generating force behind the TAZ springs from the historical development I call ‘the closure of the map.’ The last bit of Earth unclaimed by any nation-state was eaten up in 1899. Ours is the first century without terra incognita, without a frontier. Nationality is the highest principle of world governance not one speck of rock in the South Seas can be left open, not one remote valley, not even the Moon and planets. This is the apotheosis of ‘territorial gangsterism.’ Not one square inch of Earth goes unpoliced or untaxed…in theory.

occupy these areas clandestinely

from among the experiments of the inter-War period I’ll concentrate instead on the madcap Republic of Fiume, which is much less well known, and was not meant to endure. Gabriele D’Annunzio, Decadent poet, artist, musician, aesthete, womanizer, pioneer daredevil aeronautist, black magician, genius and cad, emerged from World War I as a hero with a small army at his beck and command: the ‘Arditi’. At a loss for adventure, he decided to capture the city of Fiume from Yugoslavia and give it to Italy. After a necromantic ceremony with his mistress in a cemetery in Venice he set out to conquer Fiume, and succeeded without any trouble to speak of. But Italy turned down his generous offer; the Prime Minister called him a fool. In a huff, D’Annunzio decided to declare independence and see how long he could get away with it. He and one of his anarchist friends wrote the Constitution, which declared music to be the central principle of the State . The Navy (made up of deserters and Milanese anarchist maritime unionists) named themselves the Uscochi , after the long- vanished pirates who once lived on local offshore islands and preyed on Venetian and Ottoman shipping. The modern Uscochi succeeded in some wild coups: several rich Italian merchant vessels suddenly gave the Republic a future: money in the coffers! Artists, bohemians, adventurers, anarchists (D’Annunzio corresponded with Malatesta), fugitives and Stateless refugees, homosexuals, military dandies (the uniform was black with pirate skull-&-crossbones later stolen by the SS), and crank reformers of every stripe (including Buddhists, Theosophists and Vedantists) began to show up at Fiume in droves. The party never stopped. Every morning D’Annunzio read poetry and manifestos from his balcony; every evening a concert, then fireworks. This made up the entire activity of the government. Eighteen months later, when the wine and money had run out and the Italian fleet finally showed up and lobbed a few shells at the Municipal Palace, no one had the energy to resist.

meaning trees

Many Europeans have spoken of the uniformity and featurelessness of the Australian landscape. The aborigines, however, see the landscape in a totally different way. Every feature of the landscape is known and has meaning – they then perceive differences which Europeans cannot see. These differences may be in terms of detail or in terms of a magical or invisible landscape, the symbolic space being even more varied than the perceived physical space. As one, example, every individual feature of Ayer’s Rock is linked to a significant myth and the mythological beings who created it.

Every tree, every stain, hole and fissure has meaning.

Thus what to a European is all empty land may be full of noticeable differences to the aborigine and hence rich and complex.

Europeans may thus completely misunderstand the nature of the landscape because of their point of view.

Messages only become meaningful when received and recognised. Signals and signs become perceptual or conceptual meaning through symbols. Symbols thus change the bilogical and geographical world of signals and signs into a human world of meanings.

[...]

Underlying the visible landscape there seemed to be a symbolic landscape which was more real and of which aborigines had a clear notion.

What, therefore, needs to be considered is the relation of this symbolic world to the physical, the relation between symbolic and physical space.

[...]

By using natural features, the physical structure of landscape becomes congruent with mythical structure and hence humanised. If architecture is the mode of creating virtual space, making visible an ethnic domain and setting up a sphere of influence, then aborigines create place by giving meaning to sites in terms of their culture their ethnic domain. They do what architecture does in all the ways described but without the architecture.

To Europeans land meant buildings, crops, man-made artefacts, for aborigines it was a spiritual and emotional thing. Because aborigines did not cultivate land or erect permanent dwellings, that is because they took possession of land in non-material ways rather than in European terms, the latter did not realise that aborigines owned, occupied and used land. They could thus appropriate such land without qualms.

[...]

It thus seems clear that the Australian aborigines were most definitely able to establish a sense of place which was independent of any buildings which they might have constructed. This suggests that in the larger sense the establishment of place is a symbolic process. The use of physical barriers is only one way of achieving this – although, apparently, an essential one in our culture and context.

the survey of india

There are insane maps of india covered in a dense mass of triangles.

George Everest

During the 19th century George Everest initiated a plan to formally survey, and then map, the whole of India.

mapping as conquest and control

Triangulation towers and theodlites became features of Brit­ish India as far as the edges of the empire. Local communities came to see these towers as symbols of final subjugation and resisted violently, attacking and destroying them as they began to encroach on their territory.

maps [borders and boundaries]

Modern mapping provides a context for modern demarcation. The artificial idea of non-porous frontiers and nation states.

Arbitrary lines on maps.

Mapping is a mode of knowing and a method of controlling. [see texts like Ian Barrow’s ‘Moving Frontiers’]

In a scientific context, observation, classification and modelling can be seen as a precursor to engineering, which equates to control.

The military has always been actively involved in map making, the Ordinance Survey in the UK is the primary source of civilian map­ping data and is the primary governmental mapping organisation, until recently it was directly controlled and funded by the military.

During the gulf war, and in former Yugoslavia, the commanders integrated a whole range of spatial mapping technologies, from 3d terrain models to GPS, to enhance their formidable command and control systems.

uncharted territory

Uncharted land and water was always marked on a map as terra incognita.

Ancient and medieval writers mapped through narrative; unveil­ing and revealing the places they had been in associative rather than spatial terms, focusing on descriptions of places, people, and customs. They had more in common with the linear journeys of the songlines than spatial conception of Ptolemaic maps.

colonial cartography

“The first colonial cartographers of India were thus still surveying under the influence of medieval conceptions of the uncharted and its rhetorical practices of revelation. However, the maps drawn by James Rennell and his companion surveyors did introduce new attitudes towards the representation of land and frontiers, attitudes which, in the words of R.H. Phillimore, the Survey’s historian, rescued the map “from the vagaries of fancy.” David Harvey has remarked that the reintroduction of the Ptolemaic grid, with location determined by means of latitude and longitude, stripped maps of all their medieval “elements of fantasy and religious belief, as well as of any signs of the experiences involved in their production.” Maps, now imbued with the principles of Enlightenment rationality, had become, according to Harvey, “abstract and strictly functional systems for the factual ordering of phenomena in space.” While this essay will suggest that medieval spatial notions and cartographic practices together with contingency and contestation fashioned early colonial maps which were neither purely abstract nor functional, Harvey is correct to posit that maps displayed a greater ‘objectivity’. Maps, as he says, lost much of their medieval sensuous, tactile character, and instead emphasized spatial organization and rationality. Nevertheless, how could maps rationally represent, in a coherent and systematic manner, anomalous revenue arrangements whereby, for example, the Company was permitted to demand revenue from certain tracts of land close to Bhutan from July to November only, at which time Bhutan once more claimed jurisdiction.” Ian Barrow, ‘Moving Frontiers’

new geography, new internet

The internet is about to overlay real space

For a while it seemed to stay the other side of the screen. No external evidence of its existence.

It has already escaped into the world. Like a bizarre genetic experiment that got free from a lab, evolving and self replicating uncontrollably.

The web addresses printed on everything.

Sometimes adverts have just an image and a web address, feeling almost like declarations of post-geographical independent statehood.

The next stage in its evolution looks likely to be augmentation.

Notes left on the internet attached to people and things and places that a new generation of devices will make available to you as you walk through the space and encounter those people, things and places.

Like a piece of acetate covered in rough notes and diagrams over­laying and annotating the original plan.

a cultural geography

Geographies of resistance are constituted by the transgression of ideological boundaries that are rooted in particular places and spaces

[...]

Places are active forces in the reproduction of norms, in the definition of appropriate practice

[...]

Power is the ability to make rules for others. The ability to define what constitutes appropriate behavior in a particular place is one fundamental form of this power

[...]

Transgressions disrupt the patterns and processes of normality and offend the subtle myths of consensus.

Tim Cresswell

plasticity of externalised meaning

location aware devices will reduce the importance of physically expressed symbolism bound to the built environment.

The discussion of this new plasticity of externalised meaning can be tied to ideas generated by the cultural analysis of architecture and geography (in a number of ways).

On the one hand, a study of an individual or collectively held internal model of a space can be used to inform the construction of externalised models and interfaces to spaces, on the other such analysis highlights the fact that to a large extent meaning is imposed invisibly already.

out of place

Even if new ways of invisibly annotating, marking and annotating spaces make new uses of space possible, using spaces in new ways is socially controversial.

It is possible to dispute the ‘invisibility’ of reality augmentation.

If invisible marking of spaces results in a change in who is using a space and (or) behaviour changes linked to the users of that space, then the marking of the space is indirectly visible.

If either the behaviour of the users of a space (or the users of the space themselves) appear out of place to whoever controls the space, there will be a perceived spatial and behavioural trans­gression.

Incongruous behaviour or perceived tresspass by one group encroaching on the space of another is a potential source of conflict.

New kinds of transgressions inspired by a new generation of devices may lead to confrontation and conflict.

Even without visible alteration (e.g. graffiti) when collectively held ideas about a space are challenged, either by any kind of per­ceived usage change, or by a change in who is using the space, the controllers of a space are likely to feel threatened. Control in some sense means control over meaning and range of behaviours as well as ownership or the right to exclude.

marigold

public space is used both to assert social norms and contest them.

The question is:

Who is the public space for? Who does the public space exclude? And how are these prohibitions maintained in practice?

Different people are designated different spaces by the people with the power to define boundaries.

Those who transgress the boundaries are made, by the people who control the space, into criminals.

People who are invisible or ignored by government often transgress their allocated boundaries, usually into public spaces, in order to be seen.

Here they become visible because they are not seen to be part of the ‘public’, their presence in public spaces is then contested.

Their transgressive movement is, in effect, seen as a criminal act.

The reason for criminalising their displacement is perhaps to diffuse or warn against other attempts to contest the hegemony.

The transgressive groups have moved onto a background that makes them stand out i.e., ‘public’ space, so that their dissatisfaction with the hegemony can be seen clearly.

They are then excluded publicly from the ‘public’ because they do

 

not behave according to the normative boundaries imposed by the government.

from Marigold

cultural geography focused on resistance.

An analysis of a social space can take the form..

Who uses the space?

Who is excluded?

How are those prohibitions enforced?

What constitutes the meaning and range of ‘acceptable’ behaviour in a given space, as well as who is allowed to use a given space, are made more visible through transgressions.

Mobile phones have led to ordinary people openly talking to them­selves in public spaces, this once suspect behaviour has been assimilated because of wide adoption and social acceptance of the ‘legitimate’ context of cell phone ownership.

It is an uncomfortable feeling if someone is reading from a retinal display while talking to you.

The inhabitants of Middletown still haven’t entirely got used to their mostly naked hippy neighbours.

Why, given there relatively low cost and super-technical capabili­ties, is it unacceptable for homeless people to put up tents in urban spaces?

fear geography

Public blame of victims who were in public places, for being in a dangerous or inappropriate place when they were attacked, encourages all women to transfer their threat appraisal from men to certain public spaces where they may encounter attackers. The other side of this fear of being in public space is for women to adopt false assumptions about their security when in places deemed safe for women, such as the home.

[...]

understanding of women’s use of space necessitates an awareness of their geography of fear

[...]

Women develop individual mental maps of places where they fear assault as a product of their past experience of space and secondary information.

[...]

Informal social control in public areas relies on the potential intervention of others present to act as a deterrant.

[Valentine notes that this has been eroded by automation and spending cuts, which has led to a trend away from the informal moderation of spaces by people capable of intervention]

travellers and the rural idyll

“new age travellers, ravers and drugs racketeers arrived at a strength of two motorized army divisions, complete with several massed bands and, above all, a highly sophisticated command and signals system.” [Conservative MP Michael Spicer speaking in the House of Commons] (Hansard, 1992a: 688)

“I don’t think it should be a crime to want to live like that, to want to live in a rural area rather than a big city. And it’s impossible to go out and rent a cottage or a farmhouse or buy one. Apart from people who are born to it, rural Britain is for the rich. It’s for people who can afford to buy themselves a weekend place or go and retire in the country. For me, if I want to live with space around me and trees and hills and woods, the only possible way apart from sleeping out is to buy a vehicle and live in that.” (Shannon, traveller, quoted in Lowe and Shaw, 1993:240)

[I]f the Government’s proposals are enacted, the only people free to [adopt a nomadic existence] within the criminal law will be those wealthy enough to establish sites around the Country between which they may wander, as medieval monarchs were able to do. (Lord Irvine of Lairg, CJBC-L: 1194)

“The countryside is often considered to be a place where it is possible to put into practice another way of life.” KH

“History has always dismissed the nomads” (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987: 394)

The nomad has a territory; – he [sic] follows customary paths; he goes from one point to another; he is not ignorant of points (water points, dwelling points, assembly points, etc.). But the question is what in nomad life is a principle and what is only a consequence. To begin with, although the points determine paths, they are strictly subordinated to the paths they determine, the reverse of what happens with the sedentary. The water point is reached only to be left behind; every point is a relay and exists only as a relay. A path is always between two points, but the in-between has taken on all the consistency and enjoys both an autonomy and a direction of its own … sedentary space is striated, by walls, enclosures, and roads between enclosures, while nomad space is smooth, marked only by “traits” that are effaced and displaced by the trajectory” (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987: 380-81)

from Kieth Halfacree ‘Travellers and the rural idyll’

patterns of spatial resistance

Cultural geographers have found patterns of spatial resistance that are common to graffiti, New age travellers, the homeless, raves, environmental and political protests and festivals.

Spaces are subject to group appropriation and control, and the act of using a space differently is often viewed as antagonistic. 20th century capitalism is founded on the ownership of property and the right to control the meaning and users of that property to the exclusion of others. It has been aided by the capacity to physically control the organisation and marking of real spaces. When the built environment and the meaning attached to a space become more plastic, and altering that meaning no longer implies directly marking or altering the space, how does that challenge the idea of

who owns (and who can own) the space and what it is for?

Mobile lifestyles consistently find themselves aided and encour­aged by technological developments but in conflict with people trying to control spaces.

tramps

“The mobility of the tramp was resisted on a number of fronts ranging from the courtroom, to the academy to the popular press. Reactions to the tramp formed a classic moral panic in the years 1870 through to the second world war in the United States. Following the development of the first trans-continental railroad in 1869, migrant workers and those without work were suddenly able to travel the length and breadth of the continent in relatively short periods of time. The newspapers were full of advice on how to deal with the new tramp evil ranging from avoidance to poisoning to work camps. The tramp was represented as surely, lazy, politically radical and probably foreign.” Encoding the mobile body: the production of the tramp, Tim Cresswell

just going [one american dream against another]

“The zigzagging of the plot is matched by the zigzagging of the language. It is important to note at this point that On the road was originally written as a 120 foot long continuous unpunctuated paragraph on a role of teletype. Kerouac reportedly wrote it in six days. It was only at the insistence of the editor that Kerouac introduced standard grammar and chapters so that the book could be published (nine years after it was written). Kerouac was attempting to create a nonstop statement of an experience that kept moving, using language with enough energy to break through the limitations of conventional notions of sentence form. Even in the edited version we can see this energy.” Mobility as resistance: geographical reading of Kerouac’s ‘On the road’ Tim Cresswell

Tim Cresswell argues that Jack Kerouac used mobility to express resistance

“Zelinsky (1973) described mobility as one of the defining characteristics of ‘American’ character and how this characteristic was reflected in a landscape of highways and strip developments. My point is that mobility cannot be so simply ‘mapped’ on to the landscape. Mobility is also a deeply threatening and transgressive form of behaviour often described as ‘deviant’ (think of the threat in the term ‘drifter’). The meaning of mobility in the United States (and in On the road) is therefore ambiguous at best.” Mobility as resistance: geographical reading of Kerouac’s ‘On the road’ Tim Cresswell

In on the road Kerouac sets one american dream against another.

Kerouac sets up an opposite to rootedness, familly values and the 1950’s hegemonic version of the american dream.

Kerouac subverts and contests and conjures up a vision allied to another aspect of the american dream ‘the mobile male outlaws’ [cowboys, indians, pioneers, hobos etc].

Dominant ideology in the United States places great emphasis on possession, including the possession of place. It is hard for us to question the value of ideas such as roots, community, home and neighbourhood.

When mobility is emphasized, on the other hand, it is as a means to get somewhere. Both social and spatial mobility are encouraged and connected as long as they result in ‘improvement’. Mobility which is apparently purposeless and seems to result in poverty rather than ‘social climbing’ is not generally encouraged. This is reflected in geography. Migration studies purport to be about movement but use the push and pull factors of points A and B as explanations.

People leave point A because point B appears to be favourable. It is never the case that both point A and B are unbearable and that the motion in between is the ‘pull’ factor.

Negative views of mobility are expressed in the law. Vagrancy laws inspired Kerouac to write ironically:

‘in America camping is considered a healthy sport for Boy Scouts but a crime for mature men who make it their vocation. Poverty is considered a virtue among the monks of civilized nations in America you spend a night in the caboose if you’re caught short without your vagrancy change.’ (Kerouac, 1960, p. 174);

[...]

Mobility represents a search for an American essence; haunted by the spirit of the outlaw, the hobo and the pioneer rather than the settlers, the farmers and the townspeople.”

formula for a new city

The situationists’ programme was based on what they called ‘the construction of situations’. In the first place this meant the bringing together and fusion of various separated art forms in the creation of a single, unified environment. Nor was this process restricted to a new focusing of contemporary artistic activity. All the great artistic Visions and masterpieces of the past should be pillaged and their contents made real: ‘subverted’, as the situationists called it, as part of a real script. All scientific knowledge and technical skill could be brought into play in the same way. For the first time, art and technology could become one: put on the same practical footing With reality. Working out the widest possible unified field of such ‘situations’ would reveal the true dynamic and shape of the city. Most utopian visionaries since Fourier paled before the situationists: ‘Everyone will live in their own cathedral. There will be rooms awakening more vivid fantasies than any drug. There will be houses where it will be impossible not to fall in love. Other houses will prove irresistibly attractive to the benighted traveller…’

(from ‘Formula for a new city’).

The point was the conjuring up and the mastery of immediate subjective experience. ‘Art need no longer be an account of past sensations. It can become the direct organisation of more highly-evolved sensations. It is a question of producing ourselves, not things that enslave us’ (from an article by Guy Debord in the same issue). Thus, the situationist project, as originally outlined, was the liberation of desire in the building of a new world – a world with

which we will be permanently in love.

This put them in much the same position as the first surrealists – and beyond Surrealism in the same position as a liberated psychoanalysis. Or, more simply, in exactly the same position as children. For their underlying philosophy was one of experiment and play – but play equipped with the whole of twentieth-century technology. Ultimately, all that was involved was the simplest thing in the world: wanting to make your dreams come true. And its enemies were equally simple: sterile, subjective fantasy on the one hand and, on the other, its objective counterpart: the world of art.

to play with time and space

Need for total creation has always been inseperable from the need to play with architecture: to play with time and space.

drifting and psychogeography

Before this, however, he was to play a leading role in developing the two main practical techniques used by the lettrists at this time: drifting and psychogeography. The first could be described as a sort of free association in terms of city space. The idea was simply to follow the streets, go down the alleys, through the doors, over the walls, up the trees and into the sunlight, etc, that one found most attractive; to wander, alone or with one’s friends, following no plan but the solicitation of the architecture one encountered. Drifting was an attempt to orient oneself in the absence of any practical considerations: to find the types of architecture one desired unconsciously. Amongst other adventures, they found down by the Seine a door leading to what was supposed to be a small tool store, but was in fact a concealed entrance to those parts of the Paris catacombs that are closed to the public; apparently a large proportion of the total area. Hopefully, many happy hours were spent with the matches, the skulls and the rats.

‘Psychogeography’ was the study and correlation of the material obtained from drifting. It was used on the one hand to try and work out new emotional maps of existing areas and, on the other, to draw up plans for bodies of ‘situations’ to be interlocked in the new utopian cities themselves. During the same period they were also toying with new forms of communication and deconditioning within the city. L’Internationale Lettriste were the first artists to understand the enormous potential of graffiti as a means of literary expression today. A number of the slogans they chalked or painted up – ‘Never work’, ‘Free the passions’, ‘Let us live’ – were to turn up again, more than twenty years later, on the walls of the Latin Quarter in May 1968. They also painted slogans down their trouser-legs and across their ties and shoes. The two latter items they tried to sell.

..photographs of girls, soldiers, bombings, comic-strip frames, maps of cities and diagrams of labyrinths, cathedrals and gardens

Their dominant intellectual concern was still With the fusion of all art forms in a new utopian town planning, while their experiments with architecture and the use of cities continued to provide a practical means of self-expression, a real group cohesion on the level of everyday life. Large-scale dnfts, sometimes using several teams linked by walkie-talkies, were undertaken; psychogeographic studies and architectural plans were worked out in detail. ‘We are only at the beginning of urban civilisation… Twentieth century architects should be building adventures… (IS no. 3, 1959).’

What the Sl in Paris was trying to work out was a new revolutionary critique of society: to discover forms of organisation and activity more effective than the slapstick anarchy of the lettrists. Henri Lefebvre had been their first mentor in social revolution. Once a leading French Communist Party theoretician, Lefebvre had resigned from the Party and become increasingly anarchistic. His basic contention was that contemporary society wasn’t suffering from any shortage of consumer goods, but from a new poverty, a poverty of everyday life, and that revolution today must be focused on the regeneration of this area.

Used from the very first as a term to designate contemporary (French) culture, ‘spectacle’ was a spectacle, a circus, a show, an exhibition, a one-way transmission of experience. It was a form of ‘communication’ to which one side, the audience, can never reply; a culture based on the reduction of almost everyone to a state of abject non-creativity, of receptivity, passivity and isolation. Now they saw that the same structure applied not only to cultural and leisure ‘activity’, not only to political organisation (whether that of the ruling classes or that of the so-called ‘left’). This experience of passivity, isolation and abstraction was the universal experience imposed by contemporary capitalism: an experience radiating from its basic alienation, the commodity. Henceforward, consumer capitalism was to be simply the ‘society of the spectacle’.

The first thing this meant was that the situationists could no longer see themselves as an art movement of any sort at all. Art was no more than the consumer good par excellence. Any work of art, however radical, could be digested by modern capitalism and turned into the opposite of all it had meant to those who originally created it. From the point of view of Paris – increasingly that of Debord, whose intransigence was reinforced by the appearance of Raoul Vaneigem (born 1934) – all the other sections were dabbling far too much in ‘experimental art’ and courting the danger of being separated from what was essentially a total programme. Modern society wouldn’t find any difficulty in reabsorbing individual works of art as the latest, chic revolutionary consumer item; and thus the rejection of consumer society made by the whole group would be compromised.

the new technologies of conditioning

A number of individuals were isolated in an environment designed so that nothing could happen (cells with bare walls, neon lights, the only furniture a comfortable couch and without any sounds, smells or variations in temperature). Extensive disturbances in behaviour resulted. The brain, in the complete absence of all sensory stimulation, falls below the Pitch of excitation necessary if it is to function normally. The Research Service concluded that a boring environment has destructive effects on human behaviour.

the construction of situations

The construction of situations can only begin to be effective as the concept of the spectacle begins to disintegrate. Clearly, the basic principle of the spectacle – nonintervention – is at the heart of all our alienated social life. And, equally clearly, all the most vital features of revolutionary experiment with culture have stemmed from an attempt to break the psychological identification of the spectator with the hero: to sting the spectator into action… Thus the situation is made to be lived by those who made it. The role played by a passive or merely bit-part playing ‘public’ must steadily diminish while that played by people who cannot be called actors, but rather, to coin a new word, ‘livers’, must equally steadily augment.

formula for a new city

As a result, all contemporary art has been forced to become abstract contemporary architecture being the worst example of all. Pure plastic art, telling no story and making no movement, cold and soothing to the eye.

[...]

We want to create environments that are permanently evolving

[...]

The dark has been driven away by electricity and the seasons by central heating. Night and the summer have lost all their charm and the dawn has gone. Those who live in cities want to withdraw from cosmic reality and all they dream of is ways of doing so. For obvious reasons: dreams begin and end in reality.

Yet, contemporary technology could allow an unbroken contact between the individual and cosmic reality – minus some of whatever one considers its asperities. The stars and the rain can be seen through glass ceilings. The mobile house moves with the sun. Sliding walls allow vegetation to invade life. The house on metal tracks can go down to the sea in the morning and come back to the woods at night.

Architecture is the simplest way of articulating time and space; of modulating reality; of making people dream. 1 don’t just mean expressing an ephemeral plastic beauty. Rather, a lasting influence, inscribed in the eternal graph of human desires and progress in realising them.

Thus, future architecture will be a means of modifying contemporary conceptions of time and space. It will be a means of knowledge and a means of action.

The architectural complex will be modifiable, either wholly or in part, by those living there.

Past societies offer an a priori truth and Ethics to the masses. The appearance of the concept of ‘relativity’ in a modern mind allows one to foresee something of an ‘experimental’ nature of the coming civilisation. Experimental isn’t quite the right word. Say, more supple; more ‘amused’. On the basis of this moving civilisation, architecture, at least initially, will be a tool for experimenting with the thousand different ways of modifying life – modifying it to the ends of a synthesis which will be more glorious a kingdom than anything the world has ever known.

A new form of mental illness has swept the planet: banalisation. Everyone is hypnotised by work and by comfort: by the garbage disposal unit, by the lift, by the bathroom, by the washing machine.

This state of affairs, born of a rebellion against the harshness of nature, has far overshot its goal – the liberation of man from material cares – and become a life-destructive obsession. Young people everywhere have been allowed to choose between love and a garbage disposal unit. Everywhere they have chosen the garbage disposal unit. A totally different spiritual attitude has become essential – and it can only be brought into being by making our unconscious desires conscious and by creating entirely new ones. And by a massive propaganda campaign to publicise these desires.

We have already pointed out that desire to construct situations will be one of the main foundations of any new civilisation. This need for total creation has always been inseparable from the need to play with architecture: to play with time and space.

[...]

This new vision of time and space, which will be the theoretical basis of future constructions, is still imprecise and will remain so until there has been real, practical experimentation with possible patterns of behaviour in towns designed solely to this end: towns which, apart from the few buildings strictly necessary for some degree comfort and security, would consist solely buildings highly charged with emotionally evocative power, buildings one can feel, symbolical buildings representing desires, powers, events from the past, the present and the future. A rational extension of traditional religious experience, of myths, of fairy-tales and, above all, of psychoanalysis, ‘into architectural expression’ becomes more more urgent every day… as every reason for falling in love disappears.

Everyone will live in their own cathedral. There will be rooms awakening more vivid fantasies than any drug. There will be houses where it will be impossible not to fall in love. Other houses will prove irresistibly attractive to the benighted traveller…

de sade

De Sade analyses two possible attitudes.

On the one hand, the libertines of the 120 Days of Sodom who can only really enjoy themselves by torturing to death the object they have seduced (and what more fitting homage to a thing than to make it suffer?); or, on the other, the libertines of the ‘Philosophy in the Boudoir’, warm and playful, who do all they can to increase one another’s Pleasure. The former are the feudal-type lords, Vibrant with hatred and revolt; the latter, the masters without slaves, discovering in one another only the reflection of their own pleasure.

Today, seduction tends to become increasingly sadistic. Sadism is inability to forgive the desired person for being an object. Truly seductive people, on the contrary, contain the fullness of desire in themselves; they refuse to play a part and owe their seductiveness to this refusal. In de Sade this would be Dolmance, Eugenie or Madame de Saint-Ange. This plenitude can only exist for the desired person if they can recognise their own will to live in the person who desires them. Real seduction seduces only by its honesty. And not everyone is worth seducing. This is what the ‘Beguines’ of Schweidnitz and their companions (thirteenth century) meant by saying that resistance to sexual advances was the sign of a crass spirit. The Brethren of the Free Spirit expressed the same idea: ‘Anyone who knows the God inhabiting him carries his own Heaven in himself. By the same token, ignorance of one’s own divinity really is a mortal sin. This is the meaning of the Hell which one carries with oneself in earthly life.’

Hell is the emptiness left by separation, the anguish of lovers lying side by side without being together. Non-communication is always like the collapse of a revolutionary movement. The will to death is installed where the will to life has disappeared.

mapping sex

spatial and social weirdness

Sexual relations are one way social relations actually do become concretized. Moreover, we tend to keep sex as contained as possible, and invent all kinds of boundaries to ‘hold it in’ such as monogamy, various legal injunctions, and the so-called common sense notion that sex is something we should keep to ourselves. Like a nation, sexuality has rituals and borders — it even has exiles of various types. Since the idea of a ‘nation’ is one way we perform cognitive mapping, or a way we know who is ‘with’ us and ‘against’ us, it would seem logical that sexuality is another form of cognitive mapping. And indeed, we often use the sex act as a way of mapping ourselves in social space. Why else do we burn to know who is sleeping with whom at work, or among our friends? If you are engaged in conversation with a group of people you don’t know very well, suddenly the social territory seems more familiar when you find out which people are having sex with each other. Or, on a different note, when you begin having sex with someone, your social landscape shifts dramatically. Their friends become your friends, and their social life is open to you because you have a definite place in it as ‘the sex partner.’ I have noticed, in the initial stages of a sexual relationship, the way my partner’s friends and acquaintances will say to me, ‘I’m sure I’ll see you again.’ When I am introduced to friends of friends, I rarely hear such a comment, even if it is likely to be true.

[...]

Sex is also a form of intimacy which is — at least in its most common manifestations — purely physical. This is what makes sex so literal — and so frightening. What if you love somebody, but you do not have ‘good’ sex? Or, more frequently, what if you dislike somebody, but they know exactly what it takes to give you orgasms?

[...]

If sex is so wonderful and pleasurable, why don’t we do it openly, and share it with everyone? The answer is connected directly to the way we tend to understand sex as an object, rather than an action based on thought and emotion. We use sex to quantify the value of particular relationships between people. Sex is a form of private property, which allows us to ‘own’ people or at least to figure out how much we own of them.

[...]

Through sex, I’m measuring something intangible: my connection to a particular person. For this reason, non-monogamy and public or group sex are fundamentally incompatible with the way we map sexuality today. Having been taught that ‘ownership’ and ‘property’ are concepts which limit access to particular objects, we regard sex as something which cannot circulate freely among people.

[...]

how can more than one person possess a single object at once?

Why Do You Want to Get Laid? Mapping Sexual Geographies

 

Annalee Newitz Bad Subjects, Issue # 17, November 1994

sexual geographies

The concern with regulative space and with the spaces of regulation develops Michel Foucault’s project of discipline and sexuality – a field which was, arguably, his least overtly spatial. A recurrent theme running across a number of the articles is the ways in which sexuality in the city figures as a major site of cultural disturbance. Official geographies of immorality and obscenity have repeatedly been a focus for the attempted imposition of strategic order.

[...]

Frank Mort uncovers a more recent version of this double consciousness in the sexual geography of the Wolfenden report in the 1950s. The maps of London circulated by the doyens of Sir John Wolfenden’s inquiry into homosexuality and prostitution provided the most detailed close-ups of the capital’s sexual ‘low life’. Despite the best efforts of Whitehall mandarins to define these immoral worlds as apocryphal and irregular, men from the metropolitan Élite continued to be personally and sexually dependent upon marginal spaces such as these. In all three cases, what is apparent is that the social geography of marginality frequently demonstrates a symbolic centrality. Transgression makes the norm meaningful.

[...]

What we might term a Foucaudian topography of the metropolis has been pivotal in all historical forms of strategic mapping. It would be instantly recognisable to the police commissioner, the magistrate or the sanitary engineer. Operating from on high, it mobilises a panoptic vision of the city and its subjects, who are viewed as part of a landscape and an aesthetics of discipline.

[...]

London’s own characteristic ad hocery, for example, has generated its own recognisable sexual geography. The capital never experienced a police des moeurs, or moral police, on the Parisian model, nor have its zones of respectable and disreputable behaviour been as strategically zoned as in some other European or American cities.

[...]

Moreover, the capital’s importance as the centre of empire, and latterly of post-colonial migration, has thrown up a series of extraordinarily complex spaces and cultures of sexual otherness, which have hybridised the city’s existing populations time and again.

[...]

Insights of this kind problematise static topographies of the city. They also call into question a number of the taken-for-granted spatial divisions of urban society: between the public and the private, between masculine and feminine settings, between high and low cultures. What is apparent from all of these studies is not only the shifting and historically contingent nature of such geographical distinctions, but also the liminal spaces which have been produced at the interstices of divisions of this kind and the social actors who have generated more plural forms of spatiality.

just watching her take off her shoes

g spot

Some female medical educators and researchers who have written about the clitoris and urethral sponge have been inspired to propose new ways of envisioning the female genitals. Instead of subscribing to the generally accepted model in which the clitoris and its shaft are described as a miniature penis, and the urethra, vagina and perineum are all viewed as separate unrelated bodies, they suggest instead that all these structures cohere as one functional unit that is homologous to the penis.

In her book ‘Eve’s Secrets’, Josephine Lowndes Sevely proposes a model of female sexual response in which the clitoris, vagina an urethra are recognised as coordinated entity similar to the penis. Just as the entire penis ø consisting of the two ‘corpus cavernosa’ , the corpus spongiosum (the spongy tissue making up the glans and surrounding the urethra) and the urethra – is a unified structure, so are the female genitals. The structures that comprise the female genitals respond to sexual stimulation in concert.”

SUN MEDICINE / MOON MEDICINE

On the Poison Path we speak of sun medicine and moon medicine. And likewise then, there are sun doctors and moon doctors. For the Great Work neither can be neglected.

The sun doctor moves easily through the world, unperturbed, seemingly able to open doors anywhere she wishes. A life filled with routines and good health, with attendance to detail and reliability, the sun doctor knows where she stands.

The moon doctor has no need for ground. Realities scatter before him like tarot cards in the wind. He flies to the stars and has his way with the Queen of Heaven in her celestial palace. The moon doctor rides dragons and knows the way through hell. The sun doctor knows how to stay out of hell, and does. To the sun doctor every day is unique, every day happens for the first time. To the moon doctor there are no days. He lives in one instant only, eternally preparing the lunar medicine.

angels

On the Seduction of Angels

Our Way is the seduction of angels. Trouble is, sometimes after you’ve seduced the angel, you find that it is really the angel that has seduced you. Then you find out that the angel has horns. Wonderful hard nubs of goatlike horn beneath her hair.

If you are a shaman of our way you don’t care. In fact you are delighted. You love the horns. You kiss and fondle them. You weave intimate designs upon them. And are given woven charms in return.

Angels are hard to pin down. Ethereal. Their nature is movement. They are vectors, messengers.

Angels are betweens, and the between is of special interest to Hermeticists. One doctor of our way was visited at night by an angel who made love to her and then instructed her in the secrets of the preparation of the Great Stone. Rene Descartes was given the keys to mathematics.

Angels incarnate into plants and springs, into trees, into certain trails and grottos. When, they enter men or women we detect it by a subtle glow.

Walking into sleep secretly awake, into dreams without succumbing. Our way involves the will.

When the angel comes to your bed you might say no.

if you are sick, or poisoned, the angel can threaten you, might say, “Make love with me or I will kill you, I will make you sick. I will make you crazy. I will steal your soul and hide it where neither you nor the psychiatrists will ever find it.” In such a circumstance it is best not to play the martyr.

Rituals invoke angels, especially sexual rituals. Threesomes, the minimal orgy. Or mere nudity

When she comes she is naked. The way she moves, the way she dances, it is as if she holds a knife, a chopper, and the things you thought were absolutely true and real reel and bleed

every angel is terrible..

Or maybe you have an opium ally. She is more than friendly. She’ll call you up and invite you over. And she is voluptuous, so you go. She is so good to you it seems like heaven. You get what I mean.

Be ready to make deals. Try to get something for yourself

They never give anything for free. None of them do, not the most wholly and thoroughly benevolent, not the sun itself

dvesa, “hatred” or “aversion,” a green snake;

and

moha, “ignorance”, “folly”, “delusion,” represented as a black hog.

They chase each other and bite each other’s tails.

Each poison is dependent on the others, and the whole cycle of birth and death is dependent upon them.

maps

new ways of seeing [science as a sequence of maps]

Conventional maps represent new ways of seeing and interpret­ing the space. Maps linked to, and illustrating, statistical data and migration patterns, physical, political and climatic maps, all have utility in a relevant context, but also affect the way we think about what is mapped.

 

Science can be seen as a more abstract set of maps, opening up new territories for exploration

the whirlwind tour of modern mapping

“…just as those old atlases portrayed a world at once larger and startling and disquietingly different to citizens of the sixteenth century, a new atlas is aborning in the maps churned out by contemporary scientists; just as the world looks back to celebrate and ponder the quincentennial feats of Columbus, science is making and mapping discoveries of entirely new and equally momentous geographies.

[...]

A whirlwind tour of the world captured by modern mapping extends from the atomic and microscopic to the cosmic. Planetary geologists have mapped the hills and dales of Venus by radar, Mars by magnetometer, Jupiter with photopolarimeters, the moon in person. Paleoecologists have mapped the location of lakes that dotted the Sahara until disappearing four thousand years ago, and climate modellers are mapping the climate as it will appear one hundred years hence. From 590 miles up in space, satellites can determine the average income of a neigbourhood, follow wandering ice bergs, track wandering albatross; from instruments resting on the surface of the earth, physicists can see into the heart of the planet, into the heart of the atom, into the big bang. Astronomy’s new telescopes chart the cosmos in all its multiple electromagnetic personalties: optical of course but also xray, gamma ray, infrared, radio, and ultraviolet. Biologists have mapped the location of proteins, electrons in atoms. Neurobiologists have mapped areas of the brain that light up when we dream. Where Aeneas may once have trod, the smouldering phlegrean fields now glow in aerial infrared maps. No earthly or celestial or even artistic territory has been spared this rampant cartography: experts not long ago scanned the Mona Lisa’s sublime and mysterious face with a microdensitometer, measuring and mapping the topography of pigments in la gioconda’s smile.”

The aboriginal concept of space clashed with western ideas of law and land ownership. Colonial settlers parcelled land up into neat rectangles enforcing these arbitrary boundaries with force and punishing trespassers.

A journey, and ritual associated with that journey were at the heart of the aboriginal understanding of their relationship to the land.

human beings as pattern following creatures

The army always seemed to me quite stupid.

It’s traditional key features, uniforms, drill, marching, rank, endless exercises, applied to young men who were not necessarily incred­ibly bright.

As far as I can tell I’m a pattern following animal.

There are whole years of my life that I cannot clearly remember. Sometimes in an effort to recover those years, and in the absence of a journal or diary to remind me, I grab a pile of bank statement from that year and study them to see roughly where I was and what I was doing. Usually mind numbing patterns emerge. Same Safeway, same day, every two weeks, roughly the same amount spent. Same ATM every friday night roughly the same amount. Every two weeks a meal at one of a small number of revisited restaurants. Every month rent cheque, haircut, some aberrant item like clothing or travel. If I continue long enough the pattern breaks up temporarily as I move to another city and then quickly settles down again. If I had my grocery receipts I’d find roughly the same food items recurring for months at a time. If I could trace my movements I’d find myself taking similar routes over and over again to get to the same set of destinations.

All of sudden the army isn’t so stupid. They know I’m a pat­tern-based animal, that I like patterns and find it hard to break them once they are established. So they instill patterns for every conceivable situation that a soldier might face, so that when finally that situation occurs it is easier to follow the pattern than do any­thing else (like run away).

Then there is dependence on patterns like always having some­where to sleep, always having a place to get food from, always having the same people with you, always doing the same tasks.

institutions

Sophistication, change and novelty, can cripple large institu­tions. Just clearly tell people what to do and let it be a subset of what they have always done otherwise nothing will ever actually get done. Institutions need to innovate with care, or with great violence.

A good startup company, begins agile and original, smashing the ingrained patterns of its competitors, when it reaches a certain stage of life it begins to congeal, patterns emerge and it becomes political and institutional. Smashing those patterns is possible but harder than starting again, hence the number, and success of startups in a time of accelerated change.

Venture capitalists, and the startups they fund, are the R&D department of corporate America. They take the risks and when something works it gets assimilated.

patterns in behaviour

For a while I used to keep a diary, diary entries were limited to a maximum of 10 words. An entry on a given day might look like this:

2. 3.96

climb.walk.work

sunlight.Carly.happy

The first five words were reserved for practical things, so if I worked, did nothing, wrote or coded I would use an appropriate word to represent that mental activity, if I did physical stuff like walking and climbing I’d enter whatever the activities were.

The second five words were more abstract. I’d try and think of keywords that would distill my feelings about the day (mood, people and sensations)

11.11.98

climb.swim.work”empty.bored.overcast

At night, before I wrote anything down, I’d lie in bed and try and retrace my steps during the course of the day. Establishing exactly where I had been, any interactions, and what I had done. Almost

 

a meditation ritual for sealing the day. When I had the day clear in my head, I’d distill the day down into a few practical words, and a few words that represented feelings.

[..in western culture this structuring used to fall into the category of prayer, going through your day at the end of it, considering your actions and your motives, but atheists have often discarded this practical tool, throwing babies out with bath water]

This distillation of a day down into a few words can function as a rigid form for a log. A haiku diary that, over time, builds up until patterns emerge.

Because of the concise and constrained form, it was easy to see the patterns. Patterns of productivity and inaction, of happiness, boredom and darkness, people recurring, appearing and disap­pearing, change of location (temporary and permanent).

A normal journal is too long to be read in this way. I always found that when I wrote a full page every day, and returned to it later, all I wanted was just an indication of mood, place, activity and people, and that it was hard to see patterns emerge over a longer time period, given that there was so much to read.

Another concept is the pure mood log, define a list of categories..

Boredom, fitness, health, how horny you feel, confidence, happi­ness, and then each day rate each of the categories on a scale from -5 to +5.

Then you can graph your mood and your ‘state’ over time.

Build a website that allows a group of people to do this. Aggregate moodlog entries within groups and determine group mood, plot the site graph and see if you could map mood to world events or local incidents.

Show people their patterns in a way that might be directly useful and interesting to them, even suggest changes in behaviour and be able to measure and show direct changes in mood resulting.

The extent of their effort would be 10 words or less a day for the diary, 10 numbers entered into the mood log a lot easier than keeping a conventional journal.

human patterns have become commoditised

“It was indeed the age of of information, but information was not the precursor to knowledge, it was the tool of salesmen” Earl Shorris – A Nation of Salesmen

showing people there patterns rather than using them as sales tools

Market researchers have mutated into profilers of individuals.

Market researchers have long been keying their information geo­graphically. One of the big digital mapping data companies GDT is a wholly owned subsidiary of a large market research firm, R.L. Polk (their tagline: ‘multi-dimensional intelligence’).

Zipcodes function as a means of subdividing the US for market research purposes, that is, they are a convenient topological convention for organising personal and property related data, a geographical axis.

Large chunks of the third world have no equivalent system (due to the lack of pressure from market researchers).

People could have their own patterns made available to them for non-commercial use.

extension of digital patterns and logs into physical space

The same mass tracking of behaviour that is evolving on the web, maps onto the behaviour of people and the movement of animals and objects in the real world. At the point when devices that travel with you everywhere are aware of their location, it becomes pos­sible to track you in the real world.

sell your morning walk

If you are native to a city and a tourist asks you for directions to a place, you do not necessarily tell them the way you yourself would go, which might involve convoluted shortcuts and complications, you tell them the shortest clearly describable route.

Map the way people get from A to B, and establish that tourists travel one way, locals travel one way and commercial drivers yet another.

A tourist could access that information to get a different view of the city, finding out which way a local would go, or maybe a spe­cific individual would go.

Mapquest finesse there routefinding capability using information from commercial drivers (making it difficult for a rival service to easily duplicate what they have with a pure static technology solu­tion to routefinding).

You could sell your morning walk

..consider everyone selling their morning walk

Market research used to be labour intensive and data was expen­sive to gather. Now the job is being pushed out on to the internet and we all indirectly gather data, by navigating the internet and filling in forms, and buying stuff.

Beyond studying our habits as we sit in front of computer comes the point at which everything that is static in the world is mapped and everything that moves (vehicles, portable stuff, animals, people) is tagged, location aware and on the network.

Consider the patterns of migration and ebb and flow that might emerge when that data was harvested. The maps and the visuali­sations of that data. Beautiful, useful and terrifying (like any good technology).

The dark implications are similar to there web based counterparts, with an emphasis on spatial monitoring and control.

 

seti and solloway

Elliot Solloway builds educational software while working with underprivileged kids in the school system in Detroit.

His software offers young kids a chance to think like undergradu­ates. Complexities like modeling phenomena using differential equations are present, but hidden, using natural language scaf­folding.

An example would be a piece of software for studying the local stream. You take a picture of your local stream and that image becomes the backdrop for the software, then, as a class, you begin to study it. You take measurements of all kinds. All this data is entered into the software, which becomes, over time, a model of the stream, At some point you begin to notice patterns emerg­ing, you use your model to predict outcomes and suggest causal relationships.

Another example would be modelling weather. This gets interest­ing at the point where you get kids in schools all across the world submitting data in a common form over the web. Everyone begins to contribute to a more or less accurate model of the weather independent of professional meteorologists.

If the meteorologists make some suggestions as to what kinds of phenomena they need studied, an army of kids is now at there disposal generating data and learning as they do so.

Compare this to SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Life) a govern­ment funded project that had it’s budget cut dramatically. They leveraged what they had by building a distributed model for processing the data they were collecting. The team were able to release a screensaver that used spare computing cycles on any internet connected desktop to help with the number crunching.

Intel launched a screen saver that uses spare computing cycles to help cancer research.

Recently, according to Solloway, kids across America tracked the migration of a particular species of butterfly. The implication is that kids (and everyone else) can make big science and data gather­ing projects viable in the absence of huge grants. (see also the educational initiatives of the Digital Earth project).

rooms with histories

“I have a weakness for places – old battlefields, car-crash sites, houses where famous authors lived. Bygone passions should always have an address, it seems to me. Ideally, the world would be covered with plaques and markers listing the notable events that occured at each particular spot. A sign on every pay phone would describe how a woman broke up with her finace here, how a young ballplayer learned that he had made the team. Unfortunately, the world itself is fluid and changes out from under us; the rocky islands Mark Twain was careful to avoid in the Mississippi are now stone outcroppings in a bean field. Meanwhile, our passions proliferate into illegibility, and the places they occur can’t hold them. Eventually pay phones will become relics of an almost vanished landscape, and of a time when there were fewer of us and our stories were on an earlier page. Romantics like me will have to reimagine our passions as they are – unmoored to earth, like an infinitude of cell-phone messages flying through the atmosphere.”

implicit rather than explicit

Aborigines can make the most exact and complex maps of the journeys of their ancestral figures and they themselves re-enact the journey going in procession from sacred spot to sacred spot, following the divine route. If we remember the processions in tracing the boundaries of Roman (and other) cities we find a similar way of defining place except that it was expressed concretely by building walls. In fact aboriginal areas where sacred objects are stored became sanctified and animals and people in them were safe – an early form of the city or house of refuge but without physical construction.

Aborigines do not move just in a landscape but in a humanised realm saturated with signfications.

Aborigines structure their existing physical landscape mentally, mythically and symbolically without building it.

gps data streams [eben moglen and immaterial incorporated]

MOGLEN: Well, I don’t think their answer is there’s nothing we’re going to be able to do about it. But the answer is we are no longer attempting to delay the adoption of strong encryption technology by United States export controls. You’ll notice that last night they took the error out the GPS.

WORTHINGTON: So Iraq is now going to be able to target its cruise missiles precisely on top of the Washington Monument and not 50 meters away.

MOGLEN: Yes. The military says they will continue to provide wrong information in just those places that are absolutely important, but I don’t think that means the White House or the Washington Monument. I think that means missile silos in Montana.

WORTHINGTON: Do you think, ten years from now, we’ll see maps published showing the version of the United States that’s being released now, with these abrupt transitions from crystal clarity to fog?

MOGLEN: Mapmaking is a very interesting subject in general, because when everybody in the country is carrying GPS equipment, one kind of mapmaking that will be absolutely possible consists of the whole structure of what we think of as free data. That is to say – people voluntarily walking around with GPS equipped cell phones donating the stream of their information to a mapping database which will be a very accurate map of everywhere all the time. Every bridge, every road, every place in the country will be repeatedly measured by people moving around with GPS equipment.

WORTHINGTON: Have you heard of any project like this today?

MOGLEN: I’m not aware of any. But you can see that it will happen, because that data stream will exist, and there will be a kind of decentralized geographic information service structure, but I don’t think anybody has yet thought about what will happen. You have lots of people thinking about it from a commercial point of view – Pizza Hut guys wondering how soon they’ll be able to advertise to you on your cell phone where the closest Pizza Hut is.

no guarantee of liberatory use of tech

“The banalization of TV, the yuppification of computers & the militarization of Space suggest that these technologies in themselves provide no “determined” guarantee of their liberatory use.”

Hakim Bey

liberation and destruction

New technology, before it arrives, heralds destruction or libera­tion depending on whose account you happen to be reading. The internet has been (all at once) an anarchists tool, a military tool, a tool for salesmen and businesses, and in general a communica­tions medium for everyone able to use it for whatever purpose they intend.

social control [police sensorium]

“But this is hardly the ultimate police sensorium. As gang hysteria and the war on crack keep the city’s coffers open to police funding requests, it is likely the LAPD will continue to win political support for ambitious capital investment programs in new technology. Having brought policing up to the levels of the Vietnam War and early NASA, it is almost inevitable that the LAPD, and other advanced police force, will try to acquire the technology of the Electronic Battlefield and even Star Wars. We are at the threshold of the universal electronic tagging of property and people – both criminal and non-criminal (small children, for example) – monitered by both cellular and centralized surveillances. Of the latter, ex-Los Angeles police chief, and now state senator, Ed Davis (Republican – Valencia) has proposed the use of a geosynclical space satellite to counter pandemic car theft in the region. Electronic alarm systems, already tested in New England, would alert police if a properly tagged car was stolen; satellite monitoring would extend coverage over Los Angeles’s vast metropolitan area. Once in orbit, of course, the role of a law enforcement satellite would grow to encompass other forms of surveillance and control.” page 253

“As part of it’s “astro” program LAPD helicopters maintain an average nineteen-hour-per-day vigil over ‘high crime areas’, tactically coordinated to patrol car forces, and exceeding even the British Army’s surveillance of Belfast. To facilitate ground-air synchronization, thousands of residential rooftops have been painted with identifying street numbers, transforming the aerial view of the city into a huge police grid.” page 252

“To complain about the society of the spectacle as a contemporary social disease is to forget the it was the Romans who declared that all the people wanted in order to be contented was bread and circuses, or pizza and television, if you prefer.” Marcos Novak

social control through information

People will almost certainly use location aware devices without strong privacy protection in place, as long as transactions are secure and there is no overt discernable violation. If it makes there lives easier Ameri­cans seem content to have huge market research firms keeping data on them and selling that data.

This is an argument for strong encryption, impartial automated infomediaries, and a non-proprietary distributed open source infrastructure.

If this technology impacts without privacy built-in, all kinds of organisations could not only know your internet browsing habits, but where and when you go (in real time – i.e. where are you now), what you buy and who you see, and from that establish the patterns in your spatial behaviour. A step beyond being able to sell your bank statement.

If all our experience becomes mediated by technology how do we stop salesmen getting access to our every waking moment irrespective of place and time?

magic(k)al tech

magic[k]al tech definition

‘magickal technology’ defined as tools that allow individuals and groups to generate, impose and reinforce alternative realities and ways of seeing.

magickal technology manifests in diverse ways; consumer elec­tronics, buildings and the environment, habits of mind and social norms, conventions relating to the body..

..Location aware devices (LADS) represent a significant develop­ment in the evolution of magickal technology.

[read the headmap manifesto and headmap localis(z)ation for more on the implications of location aware devices]

hyp[g]nosis

Milton Erickson, the hypnotherapy guru made it clear that even under hypnosis it’s very difficult to force someone to do something against their will. However it is pos­sible through suggestion to lead them where you want them to go. The power of suggestion means is possible to get people to do things by genrat­ing an imagined environment and context in which the choice you want them to make is implicit. For example it’s much easier to suggest to someone they get naked on a nudist beach than in a library. The trance state that accompanies hypnotherapy allows internal manipulation of context and environ­ment to create an implicit suggestion (rather than having to manipulate the external environment)

..everyday environments suggestively coercive

Mind control then is a less serious problem than having your mind directed. Any environment can be created to imply an action or a thought.

Community and the built environment are both structured in such a way that your choices are infinite but the ones that are favoured by the architects of the community or the environment are easy, unconstrained and manifest.

People usually recognise and choose from (and accept) the obvious choices (Microsoft Word is infinitely configurable to suit the users preference, but the majority of users never change the default settings, the French resistance was a minority faction during the nazi occupation)

This is only sinister if the implied choices and action go against your interests, or the interests of others.

 

empirical limitations and ehancing the senses

The human mind does not perceive, and never has perceived, ‘reality’ to its ultimate extent. Perceptual tests reveal that the human mind derives its impression of so-called ‘reality’ through an astonishingly narrow and data-poor series of quick retinal impressions. This very limited visual tracking – commonly only ten to fifteen percent of our environment is ever subjected to a direct flow by the eyeball – is assembled into a seamless perception of reality by the optic centre of the brain (assisted by neural-net subprocessing in the retina and optic nerve). These human organic, wet-ware visual processors like all processors, could be ‘hacked’.

Beyond judgement – this is in some sense the last revelation. The entire ontological structure of Cartesian doubt has been rendered irrelevant by neural-implant science. The fundamental cosmic constants of life and thought can now be directly engineered. Philosophy’s despotism with its predilection for Platonic-fascist top-down solutions is subverted. With the capacity to enhance the effect, our physical command over the means of perception and cognition are complete. Here wet chemical and dry computer digital engineering converge.

disinformation ‘strange days (virtual spaces) by Adrian Gargett, Ph.D

trance, suggestion, set and setting

Hypnosis then is two things, gnosis (a trance state) and sugges­tion (based in a non-material, pliable context and environment).

Set and setting are words taken from the language surrounding the use of psychedelic drugs, your trip will go, not just well or badly, but in particular directions, largely based on your state of mind (set), your environment and who you are with (setting).

the original captain trips

Whereas many LSD practitioners were content to strap their patients onto a 3’ x 6’ cot and have them attempt to perform a battery of mathematical formulae with a head full of LSD, Hubbard believed in a comfortable couch and throw pillows. He also employed icons and symbols to send the experience into a variety of different directions: someone uptight may be asked to look at a photo of a glacier, which would soon melt into blissful relaxation; a person seeking the spiritual would be directed to a picture of Jesus, and enter into a one-on-one relationship with the Savior.

‘the original captain trips’ by Todd Brendan Fahey

build your way out

Set and setting are the basis of suggestion. Suggestion is just as powerful in ordinary states as it is in trance states.

Even in the absence of a trance state or hallucinogentic drugs, set and setting are all pervasive and powerful in shaping human com­munities and constructs for good and for bad.

For the most part set and setting have remained only partially in the control of individuals, the built environment, especially in cities is something externally determined and subject to incredible inter­tia, buildings tend not to be moved very often and replacements take a long time to build when they are.

The power of set and setting extends beyond choices to implied processes and actions. Kids find themselves at school surrounded by other kids, teachers and text books, and are implicitly bound to the patterns this reality dictates. Schools are usually/often there for the benefit of the kids (this thought is adjustable depending on the school, the teachers and how paranoid you are) but the implicit coercive artifice is real none the less. The same is true of the world of work, military and monastic life, occult sects and revolutionary movements, and these are just the explicit and overtly contrived cases. Arbitrary realities designed to imply ways of doing things (and who you should listen to) that usually do not originate from the individual. Even in the absence of contrivance and design, accidental or de facto structures can still imply a nar­rower range of actions.

Milton Erickson implies that it in terms of suggestion it is arbitrary whether the constructed environment and context for making a suggestion viable and attractive are internally visualised in a trance or externally realised as a real physically apprehensible situation. Physical and mental structures and processes indivis­ible.

[someone pointed out that the best way to get someone to rob a bank was not to hypnotise them but to tell them, in an appropriate setting, that it was part of a carefully controlled psychology experi­ment]

The liberating aspect of all this is that if you have the means to create your own set and setting you can make structures that implicitly support you in your efforts to get wherever you want to go and narrow down (or open up) your range of choices to get you closer to the choices you want to make. The capacity to alter the external environment can be limited in the absence of sufficient money or power. But music, art and graffiti, warehouse parties, raves and music festivals, camcorders, desktop publishing, drugs, fashion, groups and scenes have all served to give people a way to inexpensively and spontaneously ovelay an alternative vision onto contexts and environments (sets and settings) they do not directly control.

It also implies that control over your environment is not something to be surrendered lightly or blindly.

It is a good where possible idea to practice on a small scale constructing your own built environment. Organising warehouse parties, building your own house or temporary shelter are actually ways to take control of your own mind.

During the early seventies the hippies, realising that they were going to have to build themselves free of social conventions, spent a good deal of energy focused on building communes, homes and shelters without recourse to architects or conventional forms [see the book Shelter edited by Lloyd Khan and the Whole Earth Catalog’s]

magickal tenets

A new generation of pragmatic occultists made very clear a view of magick which is usable whether you allow action at a distance or restrict yourself to psychology.

 

They assert that belief in itself can manifest worlds that you cannot access without it.

It is a central tenet of occult systems of magick that belief and belief systems change the shape of reality.

the placebo effect works if the patient believes the drug being taken will be effective.

mathematics and science are magickal technologies that have conjured many different worlds during there evolution

consider the many different geometries that have arisen since Euclid or the quantum and newtonian realities which currently co-exist but which manifest different worlds

Mathematics was always on the occult magickal curriculum

and despite criticism of mathematics engineering and science for over focusing on the material world, the reality is that both activi­ties manifest incredible internal worlds and the real world manifes­tation for a long time remained incidental (archimedes considered engineering and science a distraction from the pure abstraction)

..that is control over the internal world is in some sense control over the external world

the meta belief that belief is a tool

You are the totality of what you do and can therefore change yourself by doing otherwise. Magic is the art of deliberately believing and pretending very hard and finding that it works. Highly improbable things can be done by those who are prepared to experiment with the belief that they are not quite so improbable. The world is an illusion, it has played a confidence trick on you if you let it define who you are. However, you are able to play confidence tricks on the universe and force it to accept your own definition of yourself(s). In fact, the universe, being a humorous, obliging and magical structure, will invariably collude in any such definitions you care to make, if you act skillfully. We are all charlatans, especially those persons pretending to be normal ordinary people….

[...]

..accept the meta-belief that belief is a tool for achieving effects; it is not an end in itself.

Peter Carroll [From ‘Chaoism and Chaos Magic’, Chaos International, issue 10; p. 11.]

magicians dealing in abstractions

Interestingly many modern (occult) magickians have tried to strip away a lot of traditional occult dogma and do not require you to sign up for satan or buddha, they argue that the tarot and the i ching work on the same principal of externalising the psyche, so choose either or make up your own equivalent, they say dedicate your rituals to whoever you want because the process is more important. .

Magicians may not care about which gods they pray to, but they do care about the abstractions, the foundations, and about magickal technology; they want a science of set and setting.

..empiricism

Whether there is a real world is a difficult question, but whether there is or isn’t, the world we experience is an internal construct derived from sense data. Consequently the difference between the real and the imagined is at least at some level arbitrary.

brain valve

To make biological survival possible, Mind at Large has to be funneled through the reducing valve of the brain and nervous system. What comes out at the other end is a measly trickle of the kind of consciousness which will help us to stay alive on the surface of this Particular planet.

[...]

Aldous Huxley, The Doors of Perception

the brain valve and the ego filter

In ‘the doors of perception’ Huxley argued that what we perceive normally is a filtered version of what are perceiving.

Carlos Castenada talks in terms of shifting the parameters of this filter (the assemplage point) to create new subjective realities.

some heuristic assumptions about conciousness:

- what the conscious mind is aware of is a filtered subset of what is actually perceivable and / or perceived

- the parameters of that filter can be changed effectively creating a new world

Huxley argued that hallucinogens were a ‘pipeline to Mind at Large by-passing the brain valve and ego-filter’

further assumptions

- the unconcious mind maintains the rules / map of the world and the conscious mind is subject to those rules and the constraints of the map

- gnosis / trance states allow constructive / manipulative interac­tion with the unconcious mind

- unconscious / conscious split treated as equivalent to world / self split

Acting on the self (conscious mind) then has limited effective­ness compared to changing the world (unconscious mind) which constrains the self

 

magick, soft forms hard forms

Acting on and interacting with the world [unconcious] rather than the self [conscious] is the focus of many esoteric practices (e.g. magick, meditation) but it is also the subject of serious study among psycholgists and medical researchers (e.g. hypnotherapy, placebo)

It is possible to effectively talk about acting on the world / uncon­cious from two divergent points of view

There is a spectrum with action at a distance and the group mind at one end (magick) and psychology/psychotherapy at the other

soft forms – hypnootherapy placebo

hard forms – action at a distance, group mind, aether

esoteric energy [useful model or independent and interdependent link between people]

other planes [states of consciousness or places separate and shared by others]

contriving and internalising intent and belief [changing the self or changing the universe]

ritually extermalising the psyche [working on the self or group mind / aether]

telepathy [information theory or group mind / aether]

the step between soft forms of these ideas and hard forms is small in language terms but fraught in intellectual terms.

that step is bound up with abandoning conventional attempts at material explanations in favour of some unverifiable process that allows action at a distance.

At which point you allow astral travel to be actual rather than symbolic (in the sense of the representational accuracy of what is seen, rather than a material reality). You allow spells to affect the material/aetherial universe rather than being a method for instilling intent into yourself. The individual psyche becomes joined to the collective psyche, such that actions within can cause change with­out, again so that symbolism gives way to a real networked larger or distributed consciousness.

telepathy becomes independent of information theory arguments about line of sight and infinite amounts of information fitting through the slightest connection.

energy and chakras cease to be ways of describing and become systems aligned to higher consciousness that allow occult martial applications as well as higher communication and healing

Tarot cards become not just tools for externalising the psyche, but genuine divination tools

the interesting thing is that the step doesn’t have to be taken to make the ideas useful, but that taking it makes your use of the ideas more intense. Belief may be a tool, it may be expedient to take the step even if it is wrong.

the observer affects the outcome

The observer affects the outcome. Consider trust and faith as things that are affected by the truster as much as the trusted, jeal­ousy can lead to unfaithfulness or at least constrain the actions of the trusted in negative ways.

belief as a tool rather than an end in itself

when you first come across chakras (see below for a description of chakras) often you are told to imagine them and subsequently after a period of time as you work with the imaginary structures you begin to feel them

Companies have a similar quality, a company is brought into being by imagining the structure and then manifesting it.

magick as heuristic

The line between magick and not magick is usually drawn by the observer

much that was magical is not anymore, modern science is science and not magic, chemistry is science and not alchemy

yoga is ordinary and is closer to aerobics in a lot of peoples minds than magic

occult as heuristic

occult as being constantly mined as a heuristic (and as a source of metaphors ..daemons etc)

Acupuncture and the whole concept of energy meridians have had no basis in modern science (research is just beginning to suggest otherwise). Western science has no model that supports these ideas. Yet western doctors have been recommending acupuncture and other ‘unfounded’ alternative therapies.

Mathematicians often arrive at something that is true without being able to describe the logical foundation or the whole chain of reasoning behind that answer, because they don’t know it. Calcu­lus is an example, calculus was used for a hundred years before the logical foundations began to be worked out. It was magic for a hundred years.

The alternative way to look at acupuncture, or calculus in its early stages, or any answer to a mathematical problem that you arrive at, are confident in, but have no clear incontrovertible basis for, is that your solution is heuristic. It as an answer that appears to work, that you find a basis for in parallel to using the answer while it still works.

Heuristics is a classic mathematical problem solving tool. Find the answer any way you can and then find a logical route to that answer. [see Pappus]

magick and the occult stripped of its conventional associations can be considered in heuristic terms

changing infrastructures

esoteric, occult, magick, ecstatic and hallucinogenic practices are often not ends in themselves but coded or explicit ways of altering what you are or might be.

gnosis

gnosis, that is various forms of trance, is central many of these changing infrastructures. Gnosis allows you to working on yourself at a low enough level

art objects

Art is a magickal technology. Both explicitly and implicitly.

art objects are magickal in the literal occult sense of being manifested expressions of will. Picasso produced highly charged objects with focused intent. Fetish objects.

Songs can be seen as sigils/mantras, pure cyclic statements of will and desire.

Art objects are also implicitly magickal in that they can create worlds with different rules and assumptions. Theatre employs elements of gnosis, by convention or realism causing suspension of disbelief, creating worlds with different rules and assumptions. Diggers, grifters, soldiers.

hypnosis

hypnosis is two things, a trance state and suggestion.

trance

trance states open you up, and make you succep­tible to suggestion.

there are many ways of achieveing a trance state, most connected with conventional hypnosis are based on the fol­lowing pattern:

focusing attention, for example on some visible point.

deepening your breathing

shifting attention from external sensation to internal thoughts, spatial visualisation, memories or processes. e.g. focusing on your breath, visualising some real or imagined place, visualising chakras and energy flow.

Hypnotic trances ranges from light to deep somnambulistic states.

deepening the trance state often involves metaphors to do with progression and often descent. e.g counting up or down, descend­ing stairs, visualising each of the chakras in turn, following a path leading somewhere tranquil.

hypnotists, often use challenges to establish a level of authority over their subjects. e.g. your eyelids are getting so heavy you cannot resist closing your eyes, your arms are so getting heavy you cannot lift them (or so light that they rise up on there own)

in inducing a trance state the hypnotist is studying the subject and trying to appear authoritative and to reinforce (and therefore appear responsible for) what follows from a succeptible subjects increasingly altered state.

Milton Erickson described another method of establishing an inti­tial trance. A subject would approach him and he would move as if to shake hands and as the subject reached out to him he would take the subjects outstretched right hand with his left and move it up. The split second of confusion that this caused erickson would use to establish the trance. Stage hypnotists use variations on this idea based on the confusion, disorientation and dislocation stemming from their subjects being in a stressful and potentially embarrassing situation. Shock, disorientate, suggest. Teachers and army officers use similar ideas.

suggestion and suggestibility

Hypnotists argue that it is extremely difficult to persuade a hypno­tised subject to do something that clashes with the subjects core values, and consequently suggestion works by either constructing a real or imagined context in which the required suggestion makes sense to the subject.

Human beings are just as open to suggestion whether in a trance state or not, but a trance state allows a hypnotist to work using the subjects internal constructs rather than having to construct real environments and social situations that reinforce the suggestion.

Hypnotherapists argue that entranced subjects are more conscious of the meaning of archetypes, symbolism and metaphor and that consequently stories can be con­structed that relate to the resolution or explorartion of a subjects life situation. Milton Erckson compiled books of tales appropriate to given situations and conditions.

All the conventional tricks of hypnotists, rigidity, tempo­rary amnesia, triggering post-hypnotic actions rely on suggestion

“when i count to three you will..”

..ritual

ritual can be seen as a tool for creating states of mind and caus­ing ‘appropritate’ behaviour and actions.

Psychedelic drug experiences can be heavilly affected by ‘set­ting’ that is the circumstances in which the drugs are taken, this includes the physical environment (e.g. indoors or outdoors, natural or urban) and who you are with (e.g. close friends or hos­tile strangers). Aside from setting the other major influence is the ‘set’, the state of mind of the user. Set and setting often determine whether a trip goes well or badly, and more than that how fun, useful or therapeutic a trip turns out to be.

Almost any given socially constructed situation implies an appro­priate behaviour or action.

Setting can provoke an intended state of mind and an intended behaviour or action.

Setting then can be seen as analagous to the hypnotists idea of suggestion

hypnotists maintain that people are succeptible to suggestion whether they are in a trance or not, and that suggestion can be encoded into a real or imaginary situation.

A trance allows the suggestion to be built out in the imagination of the subject rather than having to directly encode it into the environment.

Ritual as a tool is creating setting to induce set, direct a trip and manifest and reinforce a required reality

it can consequently be seen as a form of familiar form of spell casting.

Rituals can be built out of place and time, particular spatial organi­sations (architecture), clothing, forms of words, movement and behaviour,

a ritual can take the form of a trigger, causing the recall of an imprinted set

at a climbing gym before attempting a difficult route you might go through a ritual to get into a focused and positive frame of mind, the ritual may have practical value in that you calm your breath and stretch but going through the same pattern before each climbe may also trigger a frame of mind linked to previous suc­cess.

constructing a ritual can create a framework for sanctioning a required state of mind and encode and provoke a required out­come.

[see ‘future ritual’ by phil farber]

divination

Methods of divination often involve the symbolic externalisation of forces active in the individual and in life.

Tarot cards combine archetypes with a chance element which is to some degree controlled by the reader. Which cards turn up and the arrangement of those cards give insight into the question which provoked the reading.

mesa [power objects laid out on the ground]

Every curandero has his ‘mesa’ [...] a collection of numerous power objects laid out on the ground in altar-like fashion for the curing sessions. The objects are of either positive or negative nature. The mesa symbolizes the duality of the world of man and nature and of the spiritual realm, as manifested in the struggle between good and evil. The opposites among the power objects are complementary rather than irreconcilable, rather like two sides of a coin.

To the curandero, the existence of opposite forces does not mean splitting the world in two (the ‘sacred’ and ‘profane’) or establishing a rigid dichotomy between ‘this’ world of matter and the ‘other’ world of the spirit. On the contrary, the curandero seeks to perceive unity in the dynamic interaction between the forces of good and evil through the attainment of ‘vision’. Such a view of the world is very flexible and adaptable; it leaves room for the acceptance of new symbols and ideas and allows competing elements to enter into one’s structuring of reality and the behaviour determined by such structuring.

[...]

A witch or sorcerer would use this negative zone for sorcery or curing for lucrative gain; a benevolent curer like Galvaez needs it for consultation in cases of witchcraft, adverse love magic, or bad luck, since this is the realm responsible for such evils and consequently capable of revealing their sources

five classical magickal acts

Peter Carroll in Liber Kaos describes five classical magickal acts:

evocation [summoning entities for assistance] divination [e.g. tarot, i ching] enchantment [imposing your will on reality] invoca­tion [taking the form of, or being possessed by, an archetypal form or spirit] illumination [changing yourself using magick]

Peter Carroll describes basic sorcery as the creation of “artifacts, tools and instruments which interact magically with the physical world and which can be used again in more subtle ways on other levels”

[really you want to be aware of it but skip past the whole siddhis thing and work on body focused energy work]

shamanism

A shaman is a medicine man, a healer, a creator and a fixer of worlds.

A shaman has highly developed esoteric energy intelligence

A shaman is a traveller, someone who exists in more worlds than others see.

A shaman uses gnosis (trance states and dreams) to effect change

the world we perceive is a subset of the worlds to be perceived, changing what or how we choose to perceive changes the world we live in. Huxley, Mckenna and Castenada all talk in terms that imply that the psychedelic experience is a removal of the brain valve or ego filter, a route to other forms of awareness. Castenada talks in terms of the assemblage point, the group of emanations that an individual chooses to see, an individuals reality. He talks in terms of developing new forms of attentiveness, increasing awareness, escaping socially conditioned perception and arbitrary ‘ordinary’ words. He emphasises stopping the world and learning how to see differently. If our awareness has no filter we become incapacitated and overwhelmed, so the subsequent emphasis is on learning how to scan and group emanations into useful worlds at any given moment. A shaman can move the assemblage points of others.

 

A shaman makes deals, for example with the plant allies that allow him to see or travel or heal.

curandero

What emerges from many hours of taped conversation with Galvaez and participation in his curing sessions is that the hallucinogenic San Pedro cactus is experienced as the catalyst that enables the curandero to transcend the limitations placed on ordinary mortals: to activate all the senses; project his spirit or soul; ascend and descend into the supernatural realms; identify and do battle with the sources of illness, witchcraft and misfortune; confront and vanquish ferocious animals and demons of disease and sorcerers who direct them ‘jump over’ barriers of time, space and matter; divine the past, present and future – in short to attain vision, ‘to see’. And ‘seeing’, in the sense in which this word is used by the curandero, is very different from ‘looking at’.

evolution of magic[k]al technology

Location aware devices will be the first generation of a new tech­nological era, one in which a community will be able to collectively and dynamically impose invisible interpretations and community associations on any given place without physically altering it.

You can carry the externalised assumptions of your community with you instead of having to carve those assumptions into the physcial environment.

Consequently magickal technology as it becomes progressively more advanced will give ever greater individual and community determined control over externally and internally perceived set and setting.

media evolution is linked to efforts to make the physical and com­munity defined environment more plastic, to bring alternative (or dominant) models and assumptions into spaces that might encode different models and assumptions

printing presses, photography, cinema, music technology, radio, TV, computer games, web based content and communities, video projectors, cell phones…tagging, decoration, shelter building, festivals, signage, money

All these primitive early stage magickal technologies have in some way been harnessed by people grappling with the problem of making the built and community defined environment plastic and controllable.

occult and technological expansion of our ideas of what we are or might be

location aware devices are an occult project in the sense that they allow externalised portable support systems for whatever belief system you happen to be experimenting with at the time,

they will allow individuals and communities to secede from con­ventional ideas of what a space means or what we are or might be.

they represent the further evolution of external tools that acknowl­edge and support exploration and interaction with other realities.

create worlds of belief inside yourself and then externalise them.

magick vs cellphones

“when i was almost too small to remember I used to have this nurse in Haiti, a real magickal woman. This friend of hers used to sometimes go into town to the shops for her. If she’d forgot­ten to ask for something, she would walk into the garden and put her hand on this particular mango tree (with me in other arm) and she’d say ‘3 bags of sugar’ or whatever it was she needed and always they’d return with what she’d asked for. Years later I went back and saw her. She had a cell phone. I asked her about the mango tree, and she told me it still worked but the cell phone magic was more reliable.’”

dreams

cooking

“we have all the ingredients but we still don’t know what we’re cooking” Douglas Adams

life flows into inanimate objects

“Life not content with it’s own province, had flowed incontinently into the stones, river, stars and all the natural elements:

the external environment, because it was immediately part of man, remained capricious, mischievous, a reflection of his own disordered urges and fears.” Lewis Mumford

gods for everything

In antiquity there were gods for everything, rivers, streams, trees, and animals.

This anthropomorphic view of the world made the external world an extension of man himself.

A whole new layer of information overlaying the world functions in the same way.

Precedents and models for a world like this stretch from science fiction and the occult to drug experiences and the myths and leg­ends of ancient cultures.

every culture lives within its dream

“Every culture lives within its dream. It is reality while the sleep lasts, a culture lives within an objective world that goes on through its sleeping or waking, and sometimes breaks into the dream, like a noise, to modify it or to make further sleep impossible.”

“The dream gives direction to human activity and both expresses the inner urge of the organism and conjures up appropriate goals.”

Lewis Mumford

collective dreams as structuring agents

Culture is a dream, a set of arbitrary collectively agreed upon conventions. That dream is imposed upon reality. Everything in the built environment reflects upon how the collective sees itself. Visually appreciable characteristics and conventions vary between neighbourhoods, cities and states. Immigrant communities living together bring with them their own dream and overlay it on what they find (china towns, Latin quarters).

This externalised dream extends deep, if you have never stepped outside your culture, you may not notice how much of your world is mediated by an arbitrary dream.

collective dreams as structuring agents [science and politics are part of the dream]

Science, technology, art, literature, politics etc.

merging dream world and real world

We will be able to alter and experiment with the cultural inter­pretation and structuring of the physical world without physically altering it.

‘He told me of how his real life and his dream life are becoming much the same.’

to make dreams truth and fables histories

“This was the sad ambience, the bitter, depleted world in which Lewis and Tolkien wrote. They had, however, a more positive response to these conditions and events than the postimperial stoicism, cultural despair, and resigned Christian pessimism that were the response of their British contemporaries. They were not prepared imaginatively and intellectually to withdraw and accept defeat. Out of the medieval Norse, Celtic, and Grail legends, they conjured fantasies of revenge and recovery, an ethos of return and triumph. As Chaucer said in Troilus and Criseyde, they aimed “to make dreams truth and fables histories” Inventing the Middle Ages, Norman F Cantor 1991

are there plants?

“We offer a simple test for otherworldly explorations: are there plants in the realm? And if there are, what is their status.

In natural, inhabitory societies everyone is a plant person. Sure, there are exceptions – the Eskimos lived entirely by eating other souls – but those are exceptions. To walk through the Amazonian forest with the Waorani or the Quichua speaking peoples is to be deluged with plant lore: with names, uses, and legends about plant after plant after tree passing by.”

Pharmako/poeia – Plants, Posions and Herbcraft by Dale Pendell, mercury house san francisco 1995

does a firm persuasion of a thing make it so?

Then I asked: “does a firm perswasion that a thing is so, make it so ?” He replied: “All poets believe that it does, & in ages of imagination this firm perswasion removed mountains; but many are not capable of a perswasion of anything.” William Blake

a new cathedral

We can experiment without needing to alter.

Think of this analogy in terms of real space. How much does it cost to build a new cathedral? Is the cost affordable for a small distributed community of relatively poor teenagers? How much to alter and convert an existing building to some new purpose?

What if you could alter and convert real space and real spaces to serve your purpose without a legal change of ownership or real construction work.

merely trying to occur

“They are merely trying to occur, they are checking whether the ground of reality can carry them. And they quickly withdraw, fearing to lose their integrity in the frailty of realization. And if they break into their capital, lose a thing or two in these attempts at incarnation, then soon, jealously, they retrieve their possessions, call them in, reintegrate: as a result, white spots appear in our biography-scented stigmata, the faded silvery imprints of the bare feet of angels, scattered footmarks on our nights and days – while the fullness of life waxes, incessantly supplements itself, and towers over us in wonder and wonder…” Bruno Schulz – Cinnamon Streets

Teilhard de Chardin wrote about this enterprise many years ago and would be appalled by the prosaic nature of the tools we will use to bring it about. But I think there is something sweetly ironic that the ladder to his Omega Point might be built by engineers and not mystics.” John Perry Barlow

framing and annotating nature

beauty is largely outside art galleries, and it should be unobtru­sively sign posted

beauty outside

If art is about making us see what the artist wants us to see (Duchamp) then annotating nature could be art.

yugen

“To achieve the end of yugen, art had sometimes been stripped of its color and glitter lest these externals distract; a bowl of highly polished silver reflects more than it suggests, but one of oxidized silver has the mysterious beauty of stillness, as Seami realized when he used for stillness the simile of snow piling in a silver bowl. Or one may prize such a bowl for the tarnished quality itself, for its oldness, for its imperfection, and this is the point where we feel sabi. [...] The love for the fallen flower, for the moon obscured by the rain, for the withered bough, is part of sabi. Unlike yugen (to which, however, it is not opposed) sabi does not find in these things symbols of remoter eternities. They are themselves and capable in themselves of giving deep pleasure. Sabi also differs from the gentle melancholy of aware: here one does not lament for the fallen flower, one loves it.” Tsunoda, et al, Sources of Japanese Tradition

making the stone stony

“And art exists that one may recover the sensation of life; it exists to make one feel things, to make the stone STONY. The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known. The technique of art is to make objects “unfamiliar,” to make forms difficult, to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged.” Victor Shklovsky, Art As Technique

churinga [temporary and permanent]

The twofold nature of ownership characterizes all secret-sacred objects (churinga) and sites of mythological and ritual significance (Dreamings). For example among the Aranda each individual had a personal stone or wood churinga kept in a sacred ‘storehouse’ of the ritual group. The churinga is a lifeline to the spirit world and the dreaming – and people belong to it. The ‘storehouse’ may be a hole in the ground (where the churinga is buried), a hollow tree, a cleft in a rock or a shed of branches. In any case it is concealed from view and the whole area around it is forbidden to women, children and the uninitiated on pain of death.Thus while the concept of a sacred storehouse resembles that of other cultures, it is not expressed by building, and, rather than being stressed, is hidden.

A similar relationship exists between ritual groups and natural or artificially constructed Dreamings – standing stones, rock masses, waterholes, trees or stone arrangements. These are permanent and symbolic assurances of the presence of the Dreaming which are the very ground of being and keep the world going. The whole world is a single entity the main characteristic of which is reciprocity.

[...]

There is thus a clear distinction between sacred and profane, very much as Eliade suggests, even though there are no visible physical demarcations. For example when churingas were kept in caves, those entering to fetch them impressed palm prints near the entrance to establish rites of passage” indicating an awareness of a boundary between sacred and profane. In fact any place where churingas are kept becomes sacred, and the churinga is shown to initiates as a rite of passage giving rebirth into full membership of the clan. Similarly, ceremonial leaders frequently become such in special caves whereas other people who entered these caves could disappear forever. There are thus a number of rites of passage related to environmental features.

Some sacred places are specially related to the conception of children. When a woman conceives in a place where there are prominent features – rocks, boulders, ancient trees – one of the spirit children of the place enters her body and the totem of this place becomes the child’s irrespective of the father’s or mother’s totem. This shows the importance of the place of conception and the individual retains a special relationship to the natural feature and would worry if the tree was to be cut down or the rock mined.

[...]

Many descriptions and illustrations exist of ceremonies all showing the great variety, richness and complexity of the temporary ‘monuments’ used – body decorations, shields, poles, crosses and the like. Various markers may be erected, rocks emphasized by having blood poured on them or special bough huts built in which men spend much time during,ceremonials.” During some ceremonials big fires are lit as ‘temporary monuments’.

The various forms of body decorations are extremely complex involving painting, covering the body with down stuck with blood and so on as well as the use of extremely complex, elaborate and tall head gear. People so decorated could be seen as ‘temporary monuments’ claiming a place by making it sacred through linking it with myth.

 

[...]

While Western man relies on barriers to keep out nature, reduce differences between seasons and times and defines places by manipulating these barriers, aborigines define places by knowing them and their distinctions. This knowledge is perceptual and ‘real’ as well as associational, mythical and symbolic.

network conflict resolution

my god i dont want that

“Location aware device conversations often go like this: You explain the basic idea of location awareness: that is, that your cell phone will know where it is, and they go ‘MY GOD, I DON’T WANT THAT.’ And the conversation ends there. The reality is that the people who run the networks already know where your cell phone is to within a few hundred metres. The banks and shops already know from your credit card and store .loyalty. card transactions what you buy, and where you are when you buy it. Companies exist for the sole purpose of tracking your web habits, building files on you and selling that information to advertisers. A friend who used to work for one of the biggest of those companies (a computer science post-graduate specialising in privacy and encryption) just shakes his head and keeps saying .evil. when­ever you ask him about his former employer (he left voluntarily). Your bank statements, your web profile, the cell phone towers you switch between, and your behavioural idiosyncrasies (and banalities), can all find there way into a file. They know where you are, where you were and have a reasonably good idea where you will be. They can know where everyone is except the people who tread carefully and the list of people who tread carefully is probably the worst one to be on. Oh, and as one Slashdot reader pointed out, it isn.t good enough to turn your cell phone off you have to remove the battery, or better still tape the phone to the bottom of a greyhound bus headed in the other direction.

The location aware device stories that get into the mass media go: Strap bracelets to children and convicts; the more optimistic ones tell you how you can use this technology to get your BMW back. More recently they point out that in-car navigation systems can help you find the nearest McDonalds or 76.

The Teamsters union have clear policies on how and when loca­tion sensing can be used to track their members, and don.t leave it up to the employer to decide. Organised, aware people help define this reality.

Until the internet arrived, broadcast media ruled, TV, newspapers, and publishers talked to us and we couldn.t talk back on equal terms. The .one to many. function of the internet, and now all of a sudden cell phones, has changed that.

The one thing that hasn.t happened is the localisation of these tools.

Location aware devices are a way to extend our capacity to talk to each other, and not just to some bunch of people spread all over the world but to the real next door people wherever you happen to be.

It.s not that you have to meet them all. Non-contact communica­tion is an important concept in this argument. Non-contact com­munication is stuff like war-chalking or hobo code. An example: homeless in the US in the 1920.s a guy finds a good place that.s safe to sleep, when he wakes up he leaves a chalk mark on the ground. Another homeless person comes along reads the hobo coded message and understands that this is a good place to sleep. Another example, a laptop user with 802.11 wireless LAN card walking down the street in San Francisco sees a chalk mark on the pavement, she sits down on the sidewalk next to the war chalk, flips open her laptop, and checks her email using the wire­less connection the chalk told her was there.

These examples illustrate the way that location aware devices could be used to get people to communicate with each other on a local level to mutual advantage if they both do some chalking.

Location aware devices don.t use chalk. But you can leave mes­sages about anything on the sidewalk, or anywhere else. If you want examples or you don.t know what location aware devices are you can find both on this site.

Your location is already being tracked. You could make good use of that information if you could get it and had a system for making use of it. Location services are a potential source of revenue for cash hungry mobile network providers so they are going to tell you where you are, and even if you ignore them they.ll still know; unless you throw away your much loved brand new super techni­cal phone and stop using your credit cards.

The real issues are awareness and development, whether loca­tion information gets fed through an open source, peer to peer, encrypted system set up to help people help each other, or whether we just get to know where the nearest McDonalds is.

Asking people to think beyond ‘MY GOD I DON’T WANT THAT’ seems reasonable.

Anyway, us talking to each other is more scary than them knowing where we are, God knows what’s going to happen.”

social self organisation

When people consider the dangers of the chaos of a free intensely networked spatially augmented augmented world, they should also consider that like all technological advances it offers tools to both sides of any argument. ‘ends appropriate means’ may seem ominous but the ends can just as well be social advancement. Even in a critical situation, disaster response and recovery in a world of spontaneous peer to peer mesh networks, running evolved social software, seems like a sane option for coordination of local efforts to recover and help from outside. The homeland security initiative raised the point that a citizen owned spatially aware communications network could be invaluable in a crisis.

People self organise for all kinds of reasons and geomesh net­works offer any number of socially and personally advantageous opportunities.

Catching people who want to hurt other people could be made a lot easier with local communities watching out for themselves according to local and personal value systems instead of or sup­plementing often alienating top down invasive tactical operations.

[...] Second, experience shows that redundant communications are extremely important in crisis situations. Multi-modal communications are crucial to crisis operations. Terrestrial networks may fail during a catastrophic event. Wireless networks provide additional choices, including cellular packet, radio packet, and satellite networks.

balance between the liberating and controlling aspects of technology

technology is not inherently liberating.

If location aware devices reach the mass market in a form that does not cryptographically protect the user, governments and corporations are soon going to know exactly where everyone is in real time.

local law

“According to Lawrence Lessig, a Stanford law professor, the notion that governments can’t regulate [the internet] hangs upon a particular architecture of the Net. As the Internet’s architecture changes and becomes more complex, with the addition of services like filtering and geolocation, the idea that the Internet is beyond the reach of local laws and government regulation looks less and less tenable.”

states and companies with computers vs individuals with computers

“Telecommunications equipment and computers have tended to centralize the power held by the top officials in both government and private industry. Computer experts often reject this complaint. They contend that the rapid growth in the use of personal computers by millions of American citizens will cancel out the increases in power flowing to the large organisations. This defence has surface plausibility, but when the vast capital, expertise and manpower available to the large government and business organisations are compared to the capital, expertise and available working time of even the most favoured individual, the personal computer does not appear to be a great equaliser. Furthermore, who controls what information is stored in the great data bases of the united states and who serves as the gatekeeper to most of the giant communications networks.”

“According to fashionable new police jargon, espoused by both police and their radical critics, policing is ‘merely a subsystem of the total system of social control’. That description of ‘the job’ was given in 1985 by Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Kenneth Newman, as the police and home office jointly promoted new multiple agency ideas about crime control. Comprising the ‘total system of social control’ are central government departments, including the DHSS; employment, education and environment ministries; and local government agencies, including housing, education, planning and social services. Commissioner Newman’s systems theory was a fair summary of the police approach to the search for a new role in the community during the 1980’s”

“Robert Steele is a US intelligence officer with eighteen years experience, including tours with the CIA as a clandestine field officer. Four years ago, he was in charge of setting up a new US $20 million computerized intelligence centre for the Marines.

 

It was to be linked to the CIA’s central database of classified information. When the connection was made, Steele eagerly began sending queries from the Marine network to the CIA, requesting the kind of data Marines want to know, such as “What was the turning radius for ships in Brazilian ports? How much weight could the bridges of Jordan withstand?” To Steele’s utter shock, the CIA database proved useless. No one had warned him that the classified information he and thousands of other CIA operatives had been generating for years was, in the main, worthless.

From that moment, Steele’s epiphany has lead to a personal crusade to eradicate the secrecy that plagues the intelligence apparatus. Steele discovered he could have found immediate and correct answers to his queries on the ‘open’ market of information – commercial databases, academic sources, and public computer networks. “Secrecy,” Steele says, “corrupts truth.” The 50,000 bureaucrats in the intelligence community believe, he adds, “that if it is not a secret, it’s not worth knowing.” Yet Steele quotes internal studies that show up to 75 percent of classified information is available from open sources at an incredibly cheaper cost.”

[concludes with a conference announcement: “The keynote speaker will be Alvin Toffler. Also four former KGB officers will explain how they used open sources in the US to learn almost everything they needed.”]

subversiveness networks

Not only civil society but also “uncivil society” is benefiting from the rise of network forms of organization. Some uncivil actors, such as terrorists and criminals, are having little difficulty forming highly networked, nonhierarchical organizations.

“I bomb, therefore I am.”

Terrorism enables a perpetrator to publicize his identity, project it explosively, and touch the nerves of powerful distant leaders. This kind of attraction to violence transcends its instrumental utility. Mainstream revolutionary writings may view violence as a means of struggle, but terrorists often regard violence as an end in itself that generates identity or damages the enemy’s identity.

Netwar figures increasingly at the societal end of the spectrum, where the language has normally been about low-intensity conflict (LIC), operations other than war (OOTW), and nonmilitary modes of conflict and crime.

Hierarchies have a difficult time fighting networks. There are examples across the conflict spectrum. Some of the best are found in the failings of governments to defeat transnational criminal cartels engaged in drug smuggling, as in Colombia.

Most adversaries that the United States and its allies face in the realms of low-intensity conflict-international terrorists, guerrilla insurgents, drug smuggling cartels, ethnic factions, as well as racial and tribal gangs-are all organized like networks (although their leadership may be quite hierarchical). Perhaps a reason that military (and police) institutions keep having difficulty engaging in low-intensity conflicts is because they are not meant to be fought by institutions.

Cyberwar may imply a new view not only of what constitutes “attack” but also of “defeat.”

the c[four]isr architecture

Activities with the C4ISR architecture are being prioritized and held under the auspices centrally within the Department of Defense.

The C4IsR architecture being developed and which is necessary for implementation of JV 2010, has the following components:

o A robust, multi-sensor network, for achieving Dominant Battlespace Awareness (DBA) – information superiority.

o A common communications system with sufficient ability, inclusive speed and ECM jamming, as support for operations.

o An advanced “command and control” function that enables rapid deployment and logistics support to troops (faster than an opponent’s).

o A “sensor-to-shooter” system that integrates air defence, precision weapons and enables more effective battle damage assessment.

o A global information defence system for active protection of own sensors positioned globally and communication networks from enemy interference or exploitation.

o The capability for information operations which enable us to either penetrate or mislead an opponent’s corresponding systems, thus preventing information superiority with an opponent.

cu chulaind

fidchell

At that Cu Chulaind’s riastarthae overcame him

so that the air was full of their blood

[...]

The man has long, braided beautiful hair; his face is half red and half white and bright and glistening all over. His cloak is dark blue and crimson.

“Not to avoid danger have we come,” said Cu Chulaind

[...]

Then his riastarthae came upon him. You would have thought that every hair was being driven into his head. You would have thought that a spark of fire was on every hair. He closed one eye until it was no wider than the eye of a needle; he opened the other until it was as big as a wooden bowl. He bared his teeth from jaw to ear, and he opened his mouth until his gullet was visible. The warrior’s moon rose from his head.

[...]

Cu Chulaind cast his spear at Foill and broke his back and took his head and his weapons.

Cu Chulaind cast his spear at Tuachell, and the latters limbs collapsed; he went and struck Tuachell’s head off and gave the head and spoils to Ibor.

[...]

then his riastarthae came over him: a drop of blood appeared at the tip of each hair, and he drew his hair into his head, so that, from above, his jet-black locks appeared to have been cropped with scissors; he turned like a mill wheel, and he stretched himself out until a warrior’s foot could fit between each pair of ribs.

“Not difficult, that” she answered

He cast it at the boy through the water, and the boy’s innards fell at his feet.

sixteen thousand tons of pure symbolism

“Today the USAF, despite being the richest organisation of its kind anywhere, can scarcely afford to buy more than 100 fighters annually. At up to $500 million apiece – the price of a single ‘stealth’ bomber – so rare are modern weapons systems that, like some fake antiques, they have to be virtually hand crafted. Since new major systems seldom reach operational status at planned cost, there is always a tendency to pare numbers and stretch programs, causing per-unit price to escalate. Once the weapons exist they are too expensive to be tested or trained with, so that simulators have to be used. Finally, when low-intensity conflict does break out and the opportunity to use the hardware presents itself, it seems wasteful to employ such expensive systems against persons who are often an illiterate rabble, and who are not even regular soldiers. As a result, in Lebanon for example, the US Navy’s first air-strike (leading to the loss of two aircraft, total value perhaps $60 million) was also the last. Summa summarum, already today only one country can afford to own more than a handful of these systems; nor does even the US intend to replace those lost in the Gulf.”

future war

“one important way in which human societies of any kind develop their internal structure has been through fighting other societies.”

“In another sense, the question as to what future societies war for is almost irrelevant. It is simply not true that war is solely a means to an end, nor do people necessarily fight in order to attain

 

this objective or that. In fact, the opposite is true: people very often take up one objective or another precisely in order that they may fight. While the usefulness of war as a means of gaining practical ends may well be questioned, its ability to entertain, to inspire, and to fascinate has never been in doubt. War is life written large. Among the things that move between the two poles, war alone both permits and demands the commitment of all man’s faculties, the highest as well as the lowest. The brutality and the ruthlessness, the courage and the determination, the sheer power that strategy considers necessary for the conduct of armed conflict are at the same time its causes. Literature, art, games, and history all bear eloquent testimony to the same elemental fact. One very important way in which men can attain joy, freedom, happiness, even delirium and ecstasy, is not by staying at home with wife and family, even to the point where, often enough, they are only too happy to give up their nearest and dearest in favour of war.”

“Other specialist methods of parachuting have been developed. HALO has spawned HAHO (High Altitude High Opening). This allows the parachutist to be under the canopy shortly after leaving the aircraft. Its advantage over HALO is that the parachutist can take advantage of the forward drive of the canopy to travel many miles over the ground. This allows for the aircraft to drop the troops without having to overfly the target, whereas for HALO this is not the case.”

stowaway

“A man (they swore they had known him) had planned to stow away on a boat bound for Chile. It was laden with manufactured goods packed in big wooden crates, and with the help of a docker the stowaway had managed to hide himself in one of these. But the docker had made a mistake about the order in which the crates were to be loaded. The crane gripped the stowaway, swung him aloft, and deposited him – at the very bottom of the hold, beneath hundreds of crates. No one discovered what had happened until the end of the voyage, when they found the stowaway rotting, dead of suffocation.”

counter culture research and development

counter culture research and development

The spatial and social weirdness that location aware devices are going to make possible is prefigured by the spatial and social experimentation of the counter-culture.

Since the 1960’s the counter-culture has functioned as a much-needed r&d department for western societies.

The counter-culture explored alternatives to dominant forms of social and spatial organisation ..emphasising: temporary, sponta­neous, mobile, communal, free, sharing, heterarchical, networked, autonomous.

It consciously explored the plasticity of the built environment, social structures and technology; it’s explorations were spatial, imaginative, communal and constructive.

It set an agenda, which is far from complete, and only just becom­ing technically feasible.

The counter-culture has been (and still is) experimenting with new technology and new ways of using space and organising community, and this despite the extent and violence of opposition it has faced.

From Haight Ashbury to Burning Man, only the US military can claim to have been as curious, radical or as irresponsible in exploring the social and spatial possibilities offered by new technology.

Despite being troublesome and deniable at the time, the most disruptive counter-culture ideas usually find themselves assimi­lated into mainstream thought.

experimentation

The counter-culture has been experimenting with social organisa­tion, it has explored, invented and colonised new and old spaces.

continuity

a continuous line can be drawn from the 60’s to the present day

trace root

“The dominant narrative of failure of the sixties counterculture is frequently repeated in books about it. Dates in titles of books signal this: Elizabeth Nelson’s The British Counter-Culture, 1966-73, Nigel Fountain’s Underground: The London Alternative Press 1966-74, Alan Beam’s Rehearsal For The Year 2000 . . . 1966-1976. The cut-off dates alter, but there’s a general reluctance to pursue the alternative project via any actions of the next generation. These books display a shortening gap between the bemoaned ‘end’ of the counterculture and the straggly dyed green shoots of the next youth antagonism, punk rock. Fountain and Nelson are particularly guilty here: the focus of both their texts is the underground press, yet neither even mentions the explosion of fanzine culture which accompanied and contributed to the energy of the punk scene, clearly a prime example of an underground press. Not all hippy activists or writers about the scene are so myopic. In 1972, the underground publication Frendz optimistically proclaimed ‘if flower-power has gone to seed then germination must soon begin. And what King Weeds they’ll be’.”

“[the] utopian project of the sixties is still with us – in fact it never really went away.”

exploration

haight

In the late 1960’s Haight Ashbury, a cross-street in san francisco, became the consensus epicentre of a new counter-culture.

Media coverage resulted in a massive migration which the original community was unable to absorb.

The experience made clear the difficulty of maintaining a viable, permanent, fixed geographical centre to such a provocative and attractive international movement.

In 1965 LSD was legal.

“To a psychedelic eye in the sky, the Bay Area would have looked like a maze of tiny puddles of acidheads, each ignorant of the others. The Red Dog Saloon was one place where people could get an inkling – from out in Nevada – of how big it was becoming. [1965]

the superficial aspects

“They came to the Haight,” a handbill relates, “with a great need and a great hunger for a loving community. Many, wanting to belong, identified with the superficial aspects of what ‘hippie’ was. They didn’t drop out but rather changed roles.

“As a result the tone of Haight-Asbbury changed. With many people coming in expecting to be fed and housed, the older community tried to fulfill their needs. Rather than asking them to do their thing, the community tried to give them what they came for. The community tried to be something it wasn’t.

“The early members tried to save the community and as a result it began to die. It began to die because in the effort to save it the individuals lost themselves. Without individual selves the community started to become a shell with little within; to maintain the community feeling, meetings replaced relationships and organization replaced community.

“By the end of the summer we were forming organizations to save something that no longer existed. Community is a creative thing and saving is only a holding action. By desperate clinging, we lost.”

from Don Mcneill, Village Voice, Nov 30 1967

keep moving

“I lived a block above Haight street for two years, but by the end of ‘66 the whole neighborhood had become a cop-magnet and a bad sideshow. Between the narks and the psychedelic hustlers, there was not much room to live.”

This pattern became part of counter culture methodology, tempo­rary has become a doctrine and a virtue.

temporary, like concerts, and not enduring like the pyramids

“I imagine a future architecture in which you turn on a building the way we now turn on the lights. These buildings will be temporary, like concerts, and not enduring like the pyramids; and so when the use of the building is finished, the people can move on. The culture will be similar to the nomadic way of life of the old Paleolithic hunters and gatherers; the people will carry their culture in their souls, and so familiar will they be with earth, wind, and stars that civilization will be unnecessary.” William Irwin Thompson, Darkness and Scattered Light

diggers [free cities]

Theater is territory. A space for existing outside padded walls. Setting down a stage declares a universal pardon for imagination. But what happens next must mean more than sanctuary or preserve. How would real wardens react to life-actors on liberated ground? How can the intrinsic freedom of theater illuminate walls and show the weak-spots where a breakout could occur?

Guerrilla theater intends to bring audiences to liberated territory to create life-actors. It remains light and exploitative of forms for the same reasons that it intends to remain free. It seeks audiences that are created by issues. It creates a cast of freed beings. It will become an issue itself.

This is theater of an underground that wants out. Its aim is to liberate ground held by consumer wardens and establish territory without walls. Its plays are glass cutters for empire windows.

Free store/property of the possessed

The Diggers are hip to property. Everything is free, do your own thing. Human beings are the means of exchange. Food, machines, clothing, materials, shelter and props are simply there. Stuff. A perfect dispenser would be an open Automat on the street. Locks are time-consuming. Combinations are clocks. [Check this: “locks” in the 10/66 edition?]

So a store of goods or clinic or restaurant that is free becomes a social art form. Ticketless theater. Out of money and control.

“First you gotta pin down what’s wrong with the West. Distrust of human nature, which means distrust of Nature. Distrust of wildness in oneself literally means distrust of Wilderness.” –Gary Snyder

Diggers assume free stores to liberate human nature. First free the space, goods and services. Let theories of economics follow social facts. Once a free store is assumed, human wanting and giving, needing and taking, become wide open to improvisation.

A sign: If Someone Asks to See the Manager Tell Him He’s the Manager.

Someone asked how much a book cost. How much did he think it was worth? 75 cents. The money was taken and held out for anyone. “Who wants 75 cents?” A girl who had just walked in came over and took it.

A basket labeled Free Money.

No owner, no Manager, no employees and no cash-register. A salesman in a free store is a life-actor. Anyone who will assume an answer to a question or accept a problem as a turn-on.

Question (whispered): “Who pays the rent?”

Answer (loudly): “May I help you?”

Who’s ready for the implications of a free store? Welfare mothers pile bags full of clothes for a few days and come back to hang up dresses. Kids case the joint wondering how to boost.

 

Fire helmets, riding pants, shower curtains, surgical gowns and World War I Army boots are parts for costumes. Nightsticks, sample cases, water pipes, toy guns and weather balloons are taken for props. When materials are free, imagination becomes currency for spirit.

Where does the stuff come from? People, persons, beings. Isn’t it obvious that objects are only transitory subjects of human value? An object released from one person’s value may be destroyed, abandoned or made available to other people. The choice is anyone’s.

The question of a free store is simply: What would you have?

the underground press

Underground presses, and advances in printing technology played a major role in organising communities and spaces, and express­ing alternatives.

By the end of the 1960’s radical underground presses were sup­porting, informing and holding together a rapidly expanding alter­native community. Music, free festivals, political radicalism and the back to the land movement all relied for an uncensored voice on the ability to self-publish.

The FBI went to considerable lengths to undermine and destabi­lise the more radically inclined presses, coordinating damaging raids with pressure on advertisers in order to force them out of business.

Through underground presses, individuals and groups could bypass mainstream media and publish, uncensored, what would otherwise have spread only by word of mouth, functioning as precursors to the free for all of the uncensored internet and the formalised word of mouth of the Lonely Planet’s.

[Avatar, IT, Oz, the Whole Earth Catalog, Rolling Stone, Inner Space, Shelter.][Marshal Mcluhan]

underground media

The post 1960’s counter-culture has expressed itself through a succession of new technologies, photocopied zines, desktop publishing, the internet.

The internet has made possible organised archives of alternative information [vaults of erowid etc]

Lonely Planet is online

There are syndicated alternative/protest media to rival mainstream

news networks [indymedia]

Mailing lists and websites support marginal interests of every conceivable character.

Cheap access to tools for making music, film and printed matter mean that the range of media, and the number of people with access, have massively increased.

Counter-culture’s experimentation with alternative media didn’t die in the early 1970’s..

What maybe died was the idea that consistently alternative and contrary might be everybody’s religion. The counter-culture is an imaginative, creative, international tribe, with an influence disproportionate to it’s size. It is just the r&d department, but what comes out of the r&d department affects how things get done in the future.

The next generation will have location aware devices that will allow direct invisible collective marking, demarcating and annotat­ing of space.

from communes to open source

In the 1970’s there was a ‘back to the land’ movement, hippies moved out of urban envi­ronments into the ‘countryside’. This was in part an expression of a more general interest in communal living and self-sufficiency.

The communal experimentation of the late 60’s and early seventies resulted in some of the most constructive and thoughtful contributions to come out of the counter-culture during the period.

These efforts served to substantiate the hippies claim to be looking for a genuine alternative infrastructure.

The Whole Earth Catalog, set up by Stewart Brand, a biologist who found himself in Tom Wolfe’s Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test as the hippie who noticed that despite the ongoing space program there were no pictures of the earth from space. The pictures that later emerged have been credited with catalysing the environmen­tal movement, creating an awareness of how fragile the earth’s ecosystem might be and challenging the myth of inexhaustible natural resources.

The Whole Earth Catalog’s articulated a political agenda that rejected the ideas of the new left and conventional revolutionary politics in favour of a grass roots revolution based on construc­tive alternative ideas. The catalogs supplied ideas, tools and resources that supported the back to the land movement. They focused on the fledgling interest in ecology and whole systems, the creative exploration of new (and old) technology from house building, to computing to renewable energy, new (old) ideas about internal energy (alternative medicine, yoga, meditation, tai chi, acupressure, acupuncture and massage).

Shelter, another great publication from the period, focused on architecture without architects, documenting small scale self-build­ing techniques, ranging from historical, international and hippie house building experimentation.

“Nobody heckles a hippy when he’s high on work”

The Whole Earth ‘Lectronic Link (the WELL), spun off from the Whole Earth Catalog and was an early (1980’s) and influential California based bulletin board that soon got itself hooked up to the internet. Stewart Brand founded the Hackers conference which brought (and still brings) together a diverse range of com­puter geeks. A former Whole Earth editor Kevin Kelly was the first editor of Wired magazine.

Linux and the open source (free) software movement parallel the ideas that Shelter and Whole Earth exemplify, in that they funda­mentally challenge conventional preconceptions about how things could or should be done.

Linux and free software are infrastructure. Linux and the open source (free) software movement, have, by just building, imposed, de facto, new forms of community, value and exchange. It is hard to marginalise a counter-culture that can offer alternatives that rival the most successful orthodox institutions.

rethinking land

When people from urban environments move into the country they can find themselves feeling out of place.

When the hippies headed back to the land they brought a belief system with them that was often at odds with that of the communities they moved into. Locals often largely perceived agricultural land in the context of work, and maximised produc­tion. The hippies brought in new ideas about how they would live, what the land meant to them and how it should be worked. This inevitably led to a harsh dialogue, if not a direct conflict. Organic farming is one result of this argument.

The hippies who went back to the land in the seventies were often highly intelligent and hard working, land was relatively cheap so that now many of the communes that survived are land owning and relatively financially secure. Many hippy intentional communi­ties failed but some like Harbin in northern california and Findhorn in scotland have survived. The evolving survivors often function on different levels, on the one hand as collective communes for long term residents, more or less true to the original founding ideas, and on the other as commercial retreat centres catering to increasingly mainstream interest in yoga, meditation and alterna­tive therapies.

One weirdness is that since the 1980’s the original hippy life­style has been increasingly commercialised and commodified, what were once cheap alternatives are now sold at a premium. ‘Organic’ brown rice is now a luxury item. Whole Foods, a hippy health food supermarket in San Francisco, is probably the single

 

most expensive place to buy groceries in the whole city.

Many of the original hippy’s are wealthy and influential and many of the original hippy motifs have been co-opted as symbols of wealth and power. Whether this is success or failure depends on where you stand.

heuristics

Acupuncture and the whole concept of energy meridians have no basis in modern science [new research is in fact beginning to sug­gest otherwise]. Yet western doctors prescribe and recommend acupuncture and other ‘alternative’ therapies. Western science has no model that supports these ideas.

Mathematicians often arrive at something that is true without being able to describe the logical foundation or the whole chain of reasoning behind that answer, because they don’t know it. Calcu­lus is an example, calculus was used for a hundred years before the logical foundations began to be worked out. It was magic for a hundred years.

The alternative way to look at acupuncture, or calculus in its early stages, or any answer to a mathematical problem that you arrive at, are confident in, but have no clear incontrovertible basis for, is that your solution is heuristic. It as an answer that appears to work, you find a basis for it in parallel to using it.

Heuristics is a classic mathematical problem solving tool. Find the answer any way you can and then find a logical route to that answer. [see Pappus]

intentional communities

‘intentional community’ is a formal way of saying commune.

Intentional communities are interesting as a physical manifesta­tion of community derived from common interest.

Deciding to be together in real life ..after deciding that the idea of being together was worth dragging into reality.

Intentional communities usually get formed by people who have in common, religious, political, artistic, sexual or other fairly utopian ideas.

For many intentional communities, now is a good time, the inter­net making it easier for seekers to find them.

the road to kathmandu

This hirsute new breed of travellers packs a socially disruptive valence way beyond the significance of its numbers.

the Road to Katmandu

A spectre is haunting the world: the spectre of long hair. [...] In May 1967, in a joint statement, the Greek Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Public Order proclaimed: ‘Entry is prohibited of any foreigner who is unclean and not dressed properly.’ [...] The Consulate-General in Istanbul added helpfully: ‘It is not only young

 

men. Young women are also involved.’ He went on to explain that the consulate had to deal with ‘1000 problem youngsters a year’. [...] By December 1967, the virus had struck central Asia. In London, The Times revealed that ‘ “flower people” arriving in Nepal will now receive visas valid for only one week and not renewable.’ A hippie camp near Katmandu was disbanded and the leader deported. [...] May 1968, a group of twenty-two travelers (the first ‘batch’) were expelled by the Laos authorities [...] Before these luckless deportees were admitted to next-door Thailand, they were made to shave their beards and cut their hair. [...] In July 1968, Yugoslavia officially ‘declared war on hippies’ and the Belgrade newspaper Politika Ekspres reported that groups of boys armed with scissors had been forcibly carrying out haircuts on long-haired visitors. [...] In Mexico border guards began turning longhairs back with the words: ‘No hippies, no Jews; on Presidential orders.’ [...] By April 1968, Argentinian police had arrested 133 ‘hippies’ and sheared their hair to crew-cut length. In September, the Turks officially banned ‘ ‘louseniks’ from the country [...] In October 1968, the Times of India reported that: ‘Some New Delhi magistrates are wondering whether there is a sinister pattern behind the hippie invasion of the capital.’ [...] In Marrakesh, the bizarrely beautiful, velvet and satined Western girls tell stories of angry, veiled Arab ladies rushing up, shaking them and asking, ‘Who are you? Who are you? [...] In Bangkok, Western travellers are cleared from cafes by nervous Thais with sub-machine guns [...] ‘Who is in charge of you? What are your plans? Where are your headquarters?’ asked the Greeks when they gaoled Neal Phillips, an American traveller for hash offences [...] Nowhere is inaccessible. They tramp through Africa and South America. In Bangkok I met a couple who had hitch-hiked through China. [...] I met young Americans who had thumbed through South Vietnam, only to be attacked – not by Vietcong – but by ‘Vietnik’-hating, uniformed fellow countrymen [...] It has been estimated that over two thousand British ‘hippies’ passed through Kabul Afghanistan, in 1967

the hippies were out of place

lonley planet

Lonely Planet books grew out of a hippy culture that saw people drop out and travel

The third world has been opened up, by written down word of mouth, to unbelievably large numbers of young westerners with­out much money.

The lonely planet now represents a corridor that now runs throughout the third world, You can stay anywhere along that cor­ridor, meet people like yourself, eat western food, sit in restau­rants watching the latest movies on pirated DVD [while the pigs nuzzle around under the whole in the floor that is the toilet], send your email, buy deoderant, condoms, antibiotics and sunblock, and eventually fly home with a backpack full of fake stussy cloth­ing, tag hauer watches, cracked software, pirated CD’s, difficult to obtain prescription drugs, a hammock and a new sarong.

third world networks

Cyber cafes have sprung up all over the third world not just to service travellers, but also to supply the local business commu­nity and a local middle class hungry for access to computers and email.

Local trade both internal and across international borders benefits from cheap reliable communications.

The general case can be made specific.

Networks are impacting more than just the relatively wealthy west­erners in the third world, at the interface between the travellers and the local population, the local community can leverage the new infrastructure for there own ends.

Small scale manufacturers who used to have trouble keeping in contact with the travellers who came through and ordered stuff to ship back to them in the west can now take reorders by email and bypass the difficulties of time difference, the costs of conventional long distance phone calls and government postal systems. Using the web they can also reach deeper into those markets once they know they exist.

Facilities of every kind (guest houses, diving shops, climbing shops, trekking shops), have websites, often built for them by travellers to make costs cheaper; the sites bring in new business, email keeps them in touch with travllers who have returned home and may come back or tell there friends.

using networked computing in the third world

Once you get past high cost of hardware the software’s free, and its the latest stuff, same software the rest of the world is using, with all the productivity advances that software brings.

You can homebrew anything the west has with a computer. In Kathmandu the stores don’t have tills, they have old computers running till software written in india.

The internet phone revolution has made calling internationally affordable.

Cell phone infrastructure often causes conventional land line sys­tems to be bypassed, leading to isolated areas being able to go from nothing to 21st century infrastructure over night.

three days

“Only 150 years ago, the Great Plains were a vast, waving sea of grass stretching from the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico to the boreal forest of Canada, from the oak-hickory forests of the Ozarks to the Rocky Mountains.

Bison blanketed the plains-it has been estimated that 60 million of the huge, shaggy beasts moved across the grassy ocean in seasonal migrations. Throngs of Pronghom and Elk also filled this Pleistocene landscape. Packs of Gray Wolves and numerous Grizzly Bears followed the tremendous herds.

In 1830, John James Audubon sat on the banks of the Ohio River for three days as a single flock of Passenger Pigeons darkened the sky from horizon to horizon. He estimated that there were several billion birds in that flock. It has been said that a squirrel could travel from the Atlantic seaboard to the Mississippi River without touching the ground so dense was the deciduous forest of the East.

At the time of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, an estimated 100,000 Grizzlies roamed the western half of what is now the United States. The howl of the wolf was ubiquitous. The California Condor sailed the sky from the Pacific Coast to the Great Plains. Salmon and sturgeon populated the rivers. Ocelots, Jaguars, and Jaguarundis prowled the Texas brush and Southwestern mountains and mesas. Bighorn Sheep ranged the mountains of the Rockies, the Great Basin, the Southwest, and the Pacific Coast. Ivory-billed Woodpeckers and Carolina Parakeets filled the steamy forests of the Deep South. The land was alive.

East of the Mississippi, giant Tulip Poplars, American Chestnuts, oaks, hickories, and other trees formed the most diverse temperate deciduous forest in the world. In New England, White Pines grew to heights rivaling the Brobdingnagian conifers of the far West. On the Pacific Coast, redwood, hemlock, Douglas-fir, spruce, cedar, fir, and pine formed the grandest forest on Earth.

In the space of a few generations we have laid waste to paradise. The Tallgrass Prairie has been transformed into a corn factory where wildlife means the exotic pheasant. The Shortgrass Prairie is a grid of carefully fenced cow pastures and wheat fields. The Passenger Pigeon is no more; the last one died in the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914. The endless forests of the East are tame woodlots, With few exceptions, the only virgin deciduous forest there is in tiny rnuseum pieces of hundreds of acres. Fewer than one thousand Grizzlies remain.”

Dave Foreman

“Even wild animals resisted the destruction of their homelands under the hooves of invading livestock. Many of the so-called ‘renegade’ Gray Wolves, who undertook seemingly wanton attacks on cattle and sheep, were the last surviving members of their packs and had seen their fellow pack members trapped and killed. Arizona’s ‘Aguila Wolf’ (‘aguila’ is Spanish for eagle) killed up to 65 sheep in one night. Near Meeker, Colorado, ‘Rags the Digger’ would ruin trap lines by digging up traps without tripping them. Many of these avenging wolves were trap victims themselves, bearing names like ‘Crip’, ‘Two Toes’, ‘Three Toes’, ‘Peg Leg’, and ‘Old Lefty.’

Whole communities would marshal their resources to kill the last of the wolves. ‘Three Toes of Harding County’ eluded over 150 men in 13 years of attacking livestock in South Dakota. As recently as 1920, a trapper worked for eight months to kill the famous ‘Custer Wolf.’ East of Trinidad, Colorado, ran a renegade wolf called ‘Old Three Toes’, the last of 32 wolves killed in Butler Pasture. This lonely wolf befriended a rancher’s collie, who was penned into a chicken run to keep him away from the wolf. One night they found freedom together by digging from opposite sides of the fence. The collie never returned home, and was killed weeks later by a poison bait. Old Three Toes and her litter of Gray Wolf-collie whelps were discovered shortly thereafter and all were killed.”

temporary autonomous zones

temporary autonomous zones

The counter-culture has specialised in using technology to create temporary autonomous zones: spontaneous and temporary com­munities, in part a response to the failure of geographically fixed centres of exploration and resistance.

From free festivals, protests, direct actions and be-ins to their modern incarnations; modern mutations have included raves and burning man. Burning man is an entire temporary city existing only for a week that conjures up an airport, radio stations and satellite uplinks, all of which get dismantled at the end leaving nothing but the flattest stretch of desert in the USA. Burning man continues the tradition of questioning ideas of value and exchange, nothing is for sale, there is no advertising and you are invited to participate not spectate.

The long tradition of environmental protest and direct action since the 1960’s has resulted in all kinds of temporary communites. Greenpeace ships, British all-women CND camps outside the Greenham Common USAF cruise missile base, anti-road protes­tors living in trees, the spontaneous concentrations of dissent surrounding the WTO and G8 summits.

[adapt]

The Haight Ashbury scene was effectively buried under the weight of a spontaneous semi-premanent migra­tion provoked by mainstream media attention.

Clubs like UFO in London [set up in part to fund the underground press] live short intense lives defining a moment and a scene before dying under the weight of all the media attention they generate.

The counter-culture’s focus on temporary autonomous zones is in part a collective realisation that concentrations of original, good or useful energy can be made more resilient by keeping them mobile, spontaneous and temprorary.

insurrection has festive aspects

‘Participants in insurrection invariably note its festive aspects, even in the midst of armed struggle, danger, and risk.’

Meanwhile, however, we turn to the history of classical anarchism in the light of the TAZ [Temporary Autonomous Zone] concept.

Before the “closure of the map,” a good deal of anti- authoritarian energy went into “escapist” communes such as Modern Times, the various Phalansteries, and so on. Interestingly, some of them were not intended to last “forever,” but only as long as the project proved fulfilling. By Socialist/Utopian standards these experiments were “failures,” and therefore we know little about them.

When escape beyond the frontier proved impossible, the era of revolutionary urban Communes began in Europe. The Communes of Paris, Lyons and Marseilles did not survive long enough to take on any characteristics of permanence, and one wonders if they were meant to. From our point of view the chief matter of fascination is the spirit of the Communes. During and after these years anarchists took up the practice of revolutionary nomadism, drifting from uprising to uprising, looking to keep alive in themselves the intensity of spirit they experienced in the moment of insurrection.

Sort of a spiritual hedonism, an actual Path of Pleasure, vision of a good life which is both noble and possible, rooted in a sense of the magnificent over-abundance of reality.” Hakim Bey

“from among the experiments of the inter-War period I’ll concentrate instead on the madcap Republic of Fiume, which is much less well known, and was not meant to endure.

Gabriele D’Annunzio, Decadent poet, artist, musician, aesthete, womanizer, pioneer daredevil aeronautist, black magician, genius and cad, emerged from World War I as a hero with a small army at his beck and command: the “Arditi.”

At a loss for adventure, he decided to capture the city of Fiume from Yugoslavia and give it to Italy. After a necromantic ceremony with his mistress in a cemetery in Venice he set out to conquer Fiume, and succeeded without any trouble to speak of.

But Italy turned down his generous offer; the Prime Minister called him a fool. In a huff, D’Annunzio decided to declare independence and see how long he could get away with it. He and one of his anarchist friends wrote the Constitution, which declared music to be the central principle of the State . The Navy (made up of deserters and Milanese anarchist maritime unionists) named themselves the Uscochi , after the long- vanished s who once lived on local offshore islands and preyed on Venetian and Ottoman shipping.

The modern Uscochi succeeded in some wild coups: several rich Italian merchant vessels suddenly gave the Republic a future: money in the coffers!

Artists, bohemians, adventurers, anarchists (D’Annunzio corresponded with Malatesta), fugitives and Stateless refugees, homosexuals, military dandies (the uniform was black with pirate skull-&-crossbones later stolen by the SS), and crank reformers of every stripe (including Buddhists, Theosophists and Vedantists) began to show up at Fiume in droves.

The party never stopped.

Every morning D’Annunzio read poetry and manifestos from his balcony; every evening a concert, then fireworks. This made up the entire activity of the government.

Eighteen months later, when the wine and money had run out and the Italian fleet finally showed up and lobbed a few shells at the Municipal Palace, no one had the energy to resist.”

Hakim Bey

festivities often border on insurrection

[degenerates can get you in and degenerates can get you out]

Burning Man is a huge, week long, annual, temporary autono­mous zone. 30,000 people turn up in the middle of the nevada desert and build a city from scratch. The city has an airport [built that week], more radio stations than London, is focused on, and full of, temporary art objects (full-size submarines surfacing out of the desert, vast disfunctional satellite dishes and ramps for launching corpses into orbit). The whole thing is clothing optional, and fuelled on good energy, every conceivable kind of dance music, yoga and some drugs.

Nothing gets sold at burning man. You can actually buy carrot juice but you have to barter for everything else. There are no adverts, no sponsorship and no logos.

It always looks like it won’t happen again but it keeps happening.

In 1999 someone did a perfect swan dive off a 100 ft tower into the desert floor.

Met a bunch of internet billionaires at burning man. One fellow I spoke to had just floated on NASDAQ and had his share in his company valued at $100 million. He was dispensing free entheo­gens.

The rules break down at burning man, the energy is positive and the people are good. It’s self governing and has it’s own police force [black rock rangers] who keep people from jumping into fires and tell you where you can park.

People ride around the desert on motorised sofas and make smudged art with their genitals

the free festivals

The free festival at the farm in 1978 happened when a convoy had left Stonehenge after the solstice to go to another free festival we were planning. It was the early days of making the vision of festivals being a summer-long nomadic culture real. We’d identified a field at Cinnamon Lane in Glastonbury as the site – there had been a small alternative culture settlement there for a number of years, caravans and a tipi. I’d lived there myself. But when we turned up the farmers and police knew about it and had blocked off the access. The police radio’d around and eventually came up with the venue of Worthy Farm, so we all headed there under police direction. I remember seeing Andrew Kerr there, and him saying ‘This is better than ‘71’. I think it was this free festival that rekindled Michael’s interest in holding another festival, the ‘79 Year of the Child one. Actually it was Rebecca, Michael’s daughter, and Andrew Kerr – it was their interest that was rekindled.

[...]

Yet in the earlier days of Stonehenge relations with the authorities could be less confrontational. Police used their car headlights to illuminate the stage when the power failed one year, while during the long hot summer of 1976 the fire brigade sprayed water for the hippies to dance and play in around the stones

convergence

Glastonbury happens in the summer in the middle of Wiltshire in England. It’s more music orientated than Burning man and it rains more often. The principal is the same, normal rules are suspended for the week with the mass of people turning up for the weekend.

Glastonbury attracts all kinds of people, hippies, ravers, travellers, anarchists, miscellaneous alternative types and people who just sneak off from jobs and from school.

People dance all night, some get naked, some take drugs, much temporary art and social interaction, everyone lives in temporary camps although with not so much radical emphasis on there con­struction as the theme camps at burning man.

During the course of both conferences rules get suspended and stuff happens. The law enforcement and Cracking communities interact in an atmosphere that hints at a temporary cessation of hostilities.

People hack and crack and tell others how to do the same. They give lectures on how to pick locks and steal time from phone companies.

the point at which you hit the highway on the way out.

‘At Glastonbury one year, after a week inside, I remember hiking out early to the perimeter through all the madness and reach­ing the outside. I remember being shocked by the clean, sterile tarmac after all the mud. There were police there and blue lights silently flashing, and police radios. The officers looked clean cut and stern and slightly concerned in an outside sort of way. Like border guards or worried fathers. It was like leaving a country, stepping out into something less.

Leaving Burning Man one year I remember when we finally got clear of the dust thrown up by the desert and onto a proper road. I was OK until we stopped at a roadside restaurant and I walked in barefoot wearing a sarong. Realised I was on the outside and felt very sad.

Driving back from burning man to san francisco a girl hunched low on a very fast, dusty, and too big for her motorbike shot past at incredible high speed. The hair on the back of my neck stood up. I realised the burning man population was abruptly splitting up, dispersed in all directions. Temporary convergence over with. People charged with new energy, moving outwards.

Positive subversive spirit intact and spreading.

You come out different.’

some existentialists are not plant people.

I am afraid of cities. But you mustn’t leave them. If you go too far you come up against the vegetation belt. vegetation has crawled for miles towards the cities. It is waiting. Once the city is dead, the vegetation will cover it, will climb over the stones, grip them, search them, make them burst with its long black pincers; it will blind the holes and let its green paws hang over everything.

protest

[zapatistas, WTO/G8, IMC]

wto

International protest focused on the physical, symbolic and elec­tronic manifestations of WTO and G8 summits can be traced back to the zapatista observation that the globalisation of corporate capitalism needed to be matched by a globalisation of resistance. This would involve a broad based coalition targeting the manifes­tations of this globalisation.

WTO protestors from Seattle to Genoa, exhibit a high level of decentralised and despatialised organisation. But the results of this organisation are a highly focused convergence by protestors (from all over the world and from a whole range of different inter­est groups) on the physical and temporal locations of WTO related meetings wherever in the world they are held.

how was the w.t.o. protest in seattle organised?

The internet, toilet walls, flyers, Word Of Mouth – communication channels existed which were discrete, cheap and fast enough to facilitate and motivate massive spontaneous disorganised coop­eration between disparate groups with common interest.

Since Seattle an international decentralised networked communi­cations infrastructure (mostly internet based) has been set up to bypass the traditional media and report events from the protestors point of view.

Indymedia, a fully fledged syndicated news network, takes cam­corder footage, first hand accounts and interviews and distributes them through a network of international websites.

Often this news channel is the common thread the holds the coalition together and despite not being a faction themselves they are often described as such by the traditional media; by the act of reporting they (de facto) direct the protests. The Italian police at the Genoa protests broke in, smashed computers, stole tapes and discs, then lined people in a building across the road up against a wall and beat them unconscious.

A key problem with the evolving hydra-headed protest movement is differentiating peaceful from violent protest, agent provocateurs from genuine protestors, and violence directed towards symbolic targets from general looting. This was less problematic when the movement was starting out, but it has grown and attracted increasingly opportunistic and unsympathetic elements and it’s tactics and strategy have been scrutinised.

..It would be interesting if different groups of protestors (within the larger coalition) were better able to identify and demarcate them­selves spatially at demonstrations.

..so that some differentiation in the style of protest among a wide range of participating groups was visible to outside observers who usually come away with only the images of the most violent and aggressive demonstrators in their heads ..and the implied infer­ence that these images are representative of all the demonstra­tors.

The media (even the independent media) has insufficient tools for effectively representing or mapping the experience of the differ­ent parts of the whole rather than the most visually or viscerally arresting.

If a section of the demonstrators normally associated with peace­ful protest are demarcated and still become engaged in clashes with riot police, and come away covered in blood the message is a different one to ‘protestors clash with riot police’

Peaceful demonstrators are often there, and in the majority, and are not heard or represented properly. Police brutality, unsympathetic violent elements and agent provocateurs are a documented reality and it may take some technological skill to differentiate the voices of non-violent protestors and convey their experiences. Violent protest directed at property may have its place but when it repeatedly fails to clearly hit its target and drowns out significant attempts at non-violent protest, the media (tradi­tional and non-traditional) and the protestors should be working to find ways of differentiating the two voices.

AN INSURGENCY BECOMES A NETWAR

On New Year’s Day 1994, some two to four thousand insurgents of the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) occupied six towns in Chiapas, declared war on the Mexican government, proclaimed radical demands, and mounted a global media campaign for support and sympathy. Through its star-quality spokesman “Subcomandante Marcos,” the EZLN broadcast its declarations…

[...]

The Mexican government’s initial reaction was quite traditional. It ordered army and police forces to suppress the insurrection, and downplayed its size, scope, and sources, in keeping with official denials in 1993 that guerrillas existed in Chiapas.

[...]

…it [EZLN] called a press conference and issued communiques to disavow Marxist or other standard ideological leanings. It denied all ties to Central American revolutionaries. It clarified that its roots were indigenous to Mexico, and its demands were national as well as local in scope. It appealed for nation-wide support for its agenda – which included respect for indigenous peoples; a true political democracy, to be achieved through the resignation of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the installation of a multi-party transition government, and legitimate and fair elections; and the enactment of social and economic reforms, including repeal of revisions in 1992 to Article 27 of the Constitution governing land tenure, and, by implication, the reversal of NAFTA. In addition, the EZLN called on civil society to engage in a nationwide struggle for social, economic, and political reforms, but not necessarily by taking up arms. The insurgents denied that they had a utopian blueprint, or had figured out exactly how to resolve Mexico’s problems. They also soon denied that the EZLN itself aimed to seize power. Finally, they called on international organizations (notably, the Red Cross) and civil-society actors (notably, human-rights groups) from around the world to come to Chiapas to monitor the conflict..

[...]

This active response by a multitude of NGOs to a distant upheaval – the first major case anywhere – was no anomaly. It built on decades of organizational and technological groundwork, and shows how the global information revolution is affecting the nature of social conflict. The NGOs formed into vast, highly networked, transnational coalitions to wage an information-age netwar to constrain the Mexican government and support the EZLN’s cause. The Zapatistas are insurgents. But the widespread argument that they are the world’s first post-Communist, postmodern insurgents makes a point that misses a point: Their insurgency is novel; but the dynamics that make it novel – notably, the links to transnational and local NGOs that claim to represent civil society – move the topic out of a classic “insurgency” framework and into an information-age “netwar” framework. Without the influx of NGO activists, starting hours after the insurrection began, the dynamics in Chiapas would probably have deteriorated into a conventional insurgency and counterinsurgency – and the small, poorly equipped EZLN might not have done well. Transnational NGO activism attuned to the information age, not the EZLN insurgency per se, is what changed the framework – but it took Marcos’ sense of strategy to make the change work.

Dealing with civil-society NGOs – whether as allies, as in humanitarian and disaster relief operations, or as antagonists, as in some cases of pro-democracy, human-rights, and environmental movements – is a new frontier for government officials around the world.

IMPLICATIONS BEYOND MEXICO

This case indicates that social netwar can be waged effectively where a society is open, or slowly beginning to open up; where divisive social issues are on people’s minds; and where outside activist NGOs and their networks have local counterparts with which to link. Such a society should be in a region where the activists have a well-developed communications infrastructure at their disposal for purposes of rapid consultation and mobilization. Because of such conditions, Mexico provides a much more susceptible environment for social netwar than do more closed societies (e.g., Burma, Cuba, and Iran) that are not yet fully connected to the Internet.

rug mobs

..three years later and NYC is seeing mysterious groups of citi­zens (with no prior knowledge of one another) coordi­nating nefarious spontaneous rug ‘not buying’ (with 10 minutes from assemblage to dispersal). They turn up at a predefined rug (creating an impromptu crowd) decide not to buy it and leave (with noth­ing taken or damaged).

It seems that spontaneous technologically medi­ated group coordination is an established (mostly understood) and widely employable tactic. For good and bad ..and good against bad ..and bad against good ..and for no particular reason or end.

getting back down

“Nigredo is about coming down. And to come down, all the way down, takes some time. You cannot do it overnight, and you cannot do it by getting high. Nor, as the wise maintain, can you do it by reading or thinking. Body and mind must come to rest.

If you do not know the ground state intimately, how will you be able to separate the signal from the noise, during the phase of amplification.”

castenada

The book ‘The teachings of Don Juan : A Yaqui Way of Knowl­edge’ by Carlos Castenada functions in part as an argument for drugs waking you up and mediating a new way of seeing the space.

Published in 1968, the book is an account of how Don Juan, a Yaqui indian shaman, teaches Castenada the use of various drugs in a spiritual context. It focuses on accounts of these drug experiences.

In his later books Castaneda states that his drug experiences were in fact a low order appreciation of what Don Juan was trying to teach him. Don Juan had been reluctant to indulge what was in fact Castenada’s own interest in drugs, he was teaching Cas­tenada to see differently, but to see in a way that did not funda­mentally require the use of drugs.

drugs and the built environment

You may not be awake to your patterns

You may not be receptive to change or able to see that there are other patterns

Disruption, trauma and shock can open you and shake you out of your patterns, but they are not useful patterns in themselves

among people who have experimented with psychedelic drugs, the richest experiences are often not the drug experiences but the life they learned to live if they found a way back afterwards.

The new patterns they chose subsequently were more consciously chosen and less arbitrary

The question is, can you be awake, having never taken drugs, having never been to war, having never travelled, having never had your assumptions challenged.

(Some people can and some people can’t).

Acid breaks down the arbitrary stuck structural symbolism of your banal built environment

One of the functions of hallucinogenic drugs in rights of passage rituals was to show the arbitrary nature of the built and social fabric of the tribe.

People and things that are familiar, that you take for granted, through tripping become strange again. The natural [non-urban, unfamiliar] environment, which often through social conditioning becomes irrelevant and is set in opposition to the [familiar] built environment, can suddenly make more sense than the built environment [which, by comparison, can seem arbitrary and alien].

Growing up in a huge urban environment like London or New York, people can come to believe that the shape of their world is fixed and can be no other way.

The very way of doing things they are exposed to, from social patterns and constructs to architecture (literally the shape of the buildings and the fact that these buildings are there). These structures have effectively always been there and will always be, permanent and unchallengeable.

Institutions, from the banks, the schools, the shopping malls,

 

the police and the other symbols of structure and power, to the mundane and banal buildings they see around them, all project an image of permanence and stability.

Even their own internal patterns fall into this category.

Taking acid can break down the arbitrary imposed part of your belief systems, destroying the faith that what you have known is all there is, that there can be nothing else because you know nothing else.

There are less (or more) violent ways to achieve the same effect.

Travelling exposes you to different assumptions and different structures that challenge those you have grown up with.

going to America from the europe you notice how everything is the same and yet different.

The scale is wrong, there are still street lamps but they look different, the mailboxes are different, the light switches, locks and taps follow different conventions.

All these things gnaw at you quietly and force you to think about the authority of your own country’s vision in the presence of an alternative.

History, art and anthropology are soft forms [compared to, and not combined with, drugs and travel] which often fail to challenge because they are easy to bring your old assumptions to.

War is a hard form. It can destroy your built environment, disrupt routine and social structure, and fundamentally challenge assumptions about truth and dominance. War is traditionally a time when assumptions are challenged and new methods and patterns are let loose.

Anything which breaks down individual dependence on an imposed vision can free your mind, allowing you to think differently and outside convention.

A primary challenge acid lays down is:

This is a different way of looking at your world, much of what you believed was constant is variable.

Can you internalise this, can you take these new eyes into your normal life and see and think differently without acid? Given this violent disruption to your internal world can you find structures that make sense and are consistent in the shadow of a new perspective?

Acid is often viewed as a shortcut to a higher state of consciousness, a state which ascetics and holy men can struggle to attain throughout there lives.

A violent, unpredictable and dangerous shortcut.

The central question after you have taken this shortcut and been given a glimpse of how your mind might see, is can you get back to that state clean (without drugs)?

If someone asks whether they should take acid [a more serious decision than mushrooms for example - mushrooms are not trivial but they don’t fry you in quite the same way], a flawed but sort of relevant analogy is:

‘This man breaks his back and after surgery he gets to the point where he’s able to do pretty much everything he could do before. You meet him later in life, you talk to him and it turns out he has learned a great deal from his experience and that he has met people and had adventures that he would not have had his life not been violently changed. But he broke his back, his life is not as it would have been had he not, he cannot go back.’

‘There is risk and a cost associated with harder drugs, and some people should not or need not ask to be opened up.’

‘drugs may show you the way but they don’t take you there for long’

One of the beautiful things in the world is a dope fiend getting straight. They have a special radiance.

Love, a relationship, a good job, friends, all those things we call “merit” or “good karma,” are part of your medicine, part of your power. You are going to need them all, but you are going to need more.

“It is hard to know that this magic carpet exists and that one will no longer fly on it”

-Jean Cocteau

The poison doctor calls upon all of his medicines and uses poisons to fight poisons. Here we part company with Twelve Step approaches. Nothing against abstinence; “whatever works,” we say. But most poisoners would prefer to give up the identity of “being an addict” without taking on the new one of “being in recovery.” We wish to maintain and continue the recovery that led us to poisons in the first place.

[...]

You may need to change your environment. If all of your friends are Junkies you have to move. A few members of our beloved poison clan have proved exceptions to this rule, but how many of us can pull off what the magicians do? Your ally will tell you.

Having kicked one addiction does not make you immune. In fact, if you fall again you will be worse off than before. Every magician can survive one bottoming out, by definition. Don’t tempt the Fates.

“A man who, after having long been in the power of opium or hashish, has succeeded, despite his enfeeblement by the habit

 

of slavery, in mustering the necessary energy for his deliverance, seems to me like an escaped prisoner. He inspires me with more admiration than the prudent man who has never lapsed, having always been careful to avoid temptation.”

“That ugly crumpled upper surface of yours, that cerebral cortex, is almost nonexistent in lower animals, but once you got the hang of evolutionary growth and a taste of the inflated abstract thoughts you could make with that cortex, you enlarged it and enlarged it until it became eighty percent of your volume. Then you started cranking out rarefied ideas as fast as you could crank them, and issuing commands to helpless appendages like me, forcing us to act on those ideas, to give them form. Out of that came civilization. You willed it into being because, with your cortex so oversized and all, you lost your common ground with other animals, and especially with plants; lost contact, became alienated and ordered civilization built in compensation. And there was nothing the rest of us could do about it. You were holed up there in your solid bone fortress, a cerebrospinal moat around you, using up twenty percent of the body’s oxygen supply and hogging a disproportionate share of nutrients, you greedy bastard; you had hold of the muscle motor switches and there was no way any of us could get at you and stop you from spoiling the delight of the world.” (_Even Cowgirls Get The Blues_)

The above conversation took place between the thumb and brain in _Even Cowgirls Get The Blues_, and gives the reader a good idea of what I am referring to in this section. The cerebrum and cerebral cortex are what separates us from the rest of life on earth, and rules almost all we see. The brain stem, however, has remained unchanged throughout time, and is perhaps our only link to our environment.

How can you tell if you are lucky? In his letter to the Romans, Paul is clear that he has two teachings, that there is an exoteric path and that there is an esoteric path. He states unambiguously that he knows that all substances are by nature pure, that Jesus told him so. The issue then is stumbling. Another’s stumbling. Another who does not understand that all substances are pure

With the very poison, a little of which would kill any other being, a man who understands poison would dispel another poison.

The Poison Path is the narrow way, the twisting path, or no path at all. You could make it, O Nobly Born, you just might survive, yes, but who could follow you? Better to send them down the big road, well trodden and paved; this Poison Path is no shortcut. The Poison Path is best suited to tricksters and magicians who, if the stories are to be believed, come back to life after getting killed.

If you don’t feel like a normal person until you snort H this is a sign that – well, a bad sign. A sign that you must avoid it, immediately; that the prognosis of your relationship with this particular ally is poor.

dissent

Tom Frank, in his essay ‘Dark Age – why johnny can’t dissent’, attacks the ineffectiveness of a compromised counterculture which failed to evolve from it’s roots in the 1950’s and 60’s.

tom frank

“It was indeed the age of of information, but information was not the precursor to knowledge, it was the tool of salesmen”

“where citizens are referred to as consumers”

“The American economy may be undergoing the most dramatic shifts in this century, but for the past thirty years people in music, art, and culture generally have had a fixed, precise notion of whats wrong with American life and the ways in which the responsible powers are to be confronted. It is a preconception shared by almost every magazine, newspaper, TV host, and rock star across the alternative spectrum. And it is the obselesence and exhaustion of this idea of cultural dissent that accounts for our singular inability to confront the mind-boggling dangers of the information age.”

“The ways in which this system is to be resisted are equally well understood and agreed upon.The establishment demands homgeneity; we revolt by embracing diverse, individual lifestyles.

chemical anchors

“note that the audience’s untilled, emotional farmland is a single-use commodity that will be recapitalized by many industries external to the “music” industry

imprinting certain songs on the brains of a teenage audience during their formative years serves as a selection mechanism for future radio stations, commercials, period movies, etc

the period of harvesting the fruit of these early seeds is when the onetime teenagers reach their early-thirties – old enough to have earning power, young enough to have disposable income (low chance of mortgages, kids, etc).

the teenagers’ attention should be treated as part of a transaction … companies that engage said attention are benefiting from a (re)transmission medium for which they are never billed … and can never be reused … formative memories (imprinted on virgin minds) are never lost or less intense than their successors.

songs are like links in blogs … molecules that anchor chemical reactions, given appropriate catalysis … they are chrono-emotio-spatial hash signatures by virtue of early binding to formative experiences

the limited resource, the economic resource is not the songs … it’s the formative experiences … which are being sold in an invisible transaction that commits the memory’s owner to a lifetime of subsequent heartstring-pulling … unpaid and involuntary.

the music industry can and does make money by selling performance rights to these songs, into infinity … even if _all_ the songs were given away for free on P2P networks … they are an anonymous sorting mechanism … the only problem is the 17-year gap between binding the song to a memory and harvesting the disposable income of the memory’s owner.” Rich Persaud

seeming vs being

Broadly speaking, ideas can evolve to seem true or they can evolve to be true

“For the magicians not only believed in marvels but audaciously sought to work them: by their straining after the exceptional, the natural philosopher who followed them were first given a clue to the regular.”

“The dream gives direction to human activity and both expresses the inner urge of the organism and conjures up appropriate goals.”

“Everywhere the dross of fraud and charlatanism mingled with the occasional grains of scientific knowledge that magic utilised or produced.”

“If gold did not come out of lead in the experiments of the alchemists, they are not to be reproached for their ineptitude but congratulated on their audacity: their imaginations sniffed quarry in a cave they could not penetrate, and their baying and pointing finally called the hunters to the spot.”

“..to have dreamed so riotously was to make the technics that followed less incredible.”

But for all its color, Khaosan Road [epicentre and crossroads for backpacking world travellers] is more than a curiosity. It is a raucous, round-the-clock wake for a way of life that is gone forever. It is the black hole at the center of a shrinking world where the Age of Discovery has ended, all roads have been traveled and the words “remote” and “exotic” have all but lost their meaning.””The travelers have changed as well; indeed, the whole enterprise of rough travel has changed. In many ways, it has become as regimented as a standard package tour.””The sandals, the strange hair and the tie-dyed shirt are no longer a cry of rebellion, as they were in the 1960’s and 70’s. They are now the gray-flannel suit of the budget traveler, following in 30-year-old footsteps in search of enlightenment: eating the same food, listening to the same music, making the same discoveries.””The T-shirts display the grip of conformity from one generation to the next: familiar portraits of Che Guevara, John Lennon, Bob Marley, Mao Zedong, Kurt Cobain and an American Indian chief.””Young Moses Fletcher, 23, from Britain looks exactly like mature Wolfgang Maria Ohlheuser, 60, from Germany, with their loose white cotton outfits, beards and sandals, except that Mr. Ohlheuser’s beard is white.””And what is there left for these travelers to discover? The recipe for adventure can now be found in a guidebook, like the ingredients for a chocolate cake – every dirt trail, every hill-tribe village, every night market, every guest house, every glorious sunrise.””The world of travel has been tamed. The last few rough patches in Asia are being nibbled away now: the northern edges of Laos, the plains of southwestern China, the hidden villages of northern Myanmar.””Even the remotest of these have been mapped, analyzed and assessed for their curiosity quotient in the guidebooks.”

“And his tale at the beginning was like the hashish that makes people happy when awake; then it became like the hashish of a dreamer.

His words were at first as sweet as honey, his voice penetrating the multitude as the first rain of summer parched earth. From his tongue there went forth a perfume more exquisite than must or incense: his head shone like a light, the only luminary in a black night. And his tale at the beginning was like the hashish that makes people happy when awake; then it became like the hashish of a dreamer. Toward morning he raised his voice, however, and his words swelled like the rising Nile in the hearts of the people: they were for some as pacifying as the entrance into Paradise, but as frightening for others as the Angel of Death. Joy filled the spirits of some, horror the hearts of others. And the closer the moment of dawn, the more powerful became his voice, the louder it’s reverberations within the people, until the hearts of the multitude reared against each other as in a battle; stormed against each other like the clouds in the heavens of a tempestuous night. Lightening blots of anger and thunderclaps of wrath collided.

But when the sun rose and the tale of Far-li-mas closed, unspeakable astonishment filled the confused minds of all; for when those who remained alive looked about them their glances fell upon the priests – and the priests lay dead upon the ground.”

Kash legend fragment from The Masks of God, Joseph Campbell

a new form of difference

…but a new form of difference and dissent is emerging, A couple of examples would be the Open Source movement and the IMC (Independent Media Collective). The premise for this new form of dissent is constructive rather than oppositional, it is about building rather than stance.

In collectively developing Linux, the Open Source community have built an operating system which rivals Microsoft Windows,

 

and Windows is a product that has made Microsoft the most suc­cessful commercial organisation on the planet.

The IMC has created a world wide news network. Ordinary people can bypass or supplement the mainstream media, and, where they are involved in events, contribute what they have seen and heard.

Both Linux and the IMC are examples of new forms of collectively constructive community made possible by computer networks. Both have relatively flat, contribution and merit based hierarchies.

Computer networks allow opposition to organise, but more inter­estingly they make possible new forms of autonomous community and collective construction.

Location aware devices and the ability to mark and annotate real spaces will dramatically extend the possibilities for collective construction.

Dissent is really the wrong word. Building is a better one.

The accelerating spread of wireless network nodes, the informal coordination of community networks by groups like Consume in the UK and NoCat in California and the higher level self organis­ing of those groups through organisations like freenetworks.org. The realisation that wireless network nodes can broadcast loca­tion information [as an RDF feed for example]. The onset of next generation cell phone networks with advanced positional func­tionality and chip level GPS being built into phones, handhelds, laptops and wearable. The combination of proximity awareness, live, social, peer to peer wireless connectivity, and GPS. That is the geomesh we are building around ourselves. Means that a spontaneous bottom up (rather than top down) heterarchical, network organisation will soon be the easiest social structure to configure and apply effectively to almost any given problem.

It’s not a question of the edges or something to oppose its a question of conditions and structure and allowing them to change consensually and constructively

Extra-geographical states based on common interest, with their own constitutions, currency, taxation, banks etc. Communities able to collectively reinterpret the real physical world around them. Marking, demarcating and annotating real space using networks they will live in a world of agreed upon and engineered meaning that people outside the community will not see.

Real world problems, theory from architecture, from simulation, from linguistics, anthropology and psychology, ideas from science fiction, literature and mythology, all offer countless new ways to think about how this technology might evolve.

Cell phones become internet enabled and location aware, every­thing in the real world gets tracked, barcoded and mapped.

Overlaying everything is a whole new invisible mesh of textual, visual and audible information. This information becomes avail­able as you get close or when you ask.

availability

Consumer orientated, mobile, peer to peer and internet connected devices which are location aware (that is capable of determining and transmiting there current geographical location) or easilly con­nected to something that is are becoming available, the software to connect them up in interesting ways is already available.

There is pressure from the people and corporations and gov­ernment; each wanting to move this stuff forward for there own multifarious reasons (social networking, cash, E911).

geography as context and constraint

Since the internet began its exponential growth, it has been easier for ordinary people to ignore geography as a constraint, commu­nicating, organising and coordinating actions across borders and boundaries both artificial and real, using ideas and common inter­est rather than proximity as an organising principle.

cell phones

The second notable explosive growth curve charts the adoption of cell phones.

Cell phones set you free in a different sense, they allow you to communicate from anywhere.

The integration of internet access (high bandwidth peer to peer wireless networking) as a basic component of cell phone function­ality, together with location awareness (the cell phone knows it’s geographical location or what it’s close to) is leading somewhere.

The step beyond ideal, but dislocated, communities, is adding this geographical layer to the mobile internet. A spatially aware network, whether accurate (longitude and latitude) or informal (a rough indicator of proximity), means that proximity could again become a pervasive, useful but not constraining, utilitarian factor in organising community or in a searching for information.

geography has not mattered

geography is unimportant on two counts.

i. It doesn’t matter where you are – because the internet makes distance irrelevant in the context of communication or information retrieval.

ii. It doesn’t matter where you are – because you can access the internet from wherever you are.

geography doesnt matter

“It has become clear that, thanks to the internet, geography matters less and less” Wired Magazine – March 2000

i need a sandwich

but if you are moving and have a device that is location aware and connected to the internet..

 

Geography is an essential added filter

it provides a context for your needs

neo: I need a sandwich, I’m not prepared to walk more than a 200 metres

operator: knock on the door of number 17 and mrs jones will make you a sandwich if you do the washing up

mass market wearable hardware

The e911 requirements called for a new generation of location aware wireless devices.

The hardware aspects of this technological revolution have been available to the military, to large businesses and the scientific community for some time.

The technology, and the geographical state of mind, has now filtered down from the yachting community and more recently from backpack­ers and car owners.

A GPS is now a chip level commodity item (you can add it to anything). Powerful wireless network cards are commodity item. Handheld computers and over specified cell phones are commodity items.

It is already possible to annotate space.

a). work out where you are, find the coordinates (GPS or a web based address to coordinate converter)

b). write a note, include the location

c). publish an RSS place feed

You become a part of a distributed place database that is already growing rapidly and being mined.

Leave a note at that geographical location.

It’s not that hard and it’s getting easier.

by adding geographical awareness to the internet you create something new

…this is the last place I saw my father before he died.

The concept is an extension of a cartesian system and yet the point in space specified may link to an emotional state rather than a cold label.

You could search for sadness in New York.

The whole world will become an annotated space, which links from the real to the information space and back again. The world as interface.

You can search locally based on your current position,

e.g. show all the restaurants within a mile radius.

The device knows where you are and the database knows what’s close by.

peer to peer is more interesting than broadcast models

It is already possible to broadcast information, for example the location of the nearest Starbucks, but life becomes more interest­ing when consumers can contribute information.

..show me all the restaurants my friends like within a mile radius.

The structure becomes interesting when ordinary users can anno­tate that database.

At that point the database grows and the users direct its uses, they determine the future business models for such an infrastruc­ture.

You are driving down the main street of an unfamiliar town and all you can see is the shops and buildings on either side. You are effectively in a valley and all your information about the place is constrained by line of sight.

The map on the display of your mobile device however is lit up with dots which represent places of interest determined by the network Starbucks, McDonalds, 76 etc.

A more interesting case: the information you are receiving is not just a broadcast that lists the nearest Starbucks and McDonalds, but information based on your personal pro­file and the suggestions and opinions of your peers.

The places that you might be actually be inter­ested in that you can’t see are now visible and accessible to you.

Alternative bookshops, Yoga studios, old friends or whatever

Factor in everybody and their contributions and opinions, and you radically empower the system.

Conventionally in a city you would maybe know only a very few of your neighbours and mostly in the same street, your wider com­munity is present, but currently invisible and inaccessible.

Sitting at home bored, you check your device and it indicates that someone you haven’t met, but who has a friend in common, is sit­ting at home two streets across and three houses down and they are also bored.

Members of distributed communities held together by common interest could be made more aware of who within those communi­ties is physically local to them.

headgames

Assume kids have cell phones that transmit their geographical coordinates

Computer games evolve that actually get kids out of the house and running around instead of being stuck in front of a computer 93

 

screen.

Gaming stress tests technology and defines ways in which it can be used effectively (businesses for example will end up making use of the innovations that designers of these games instantiate).

‘go to the end of their road and climb onto the roof of the aban­doned cinema’ (or whatever; localization involves user contribu­tion)

..when the device transmits the coordinates of the top of the cinema the game gives them with the next problem… (add a time component: run to the end of the road and climb onto the roof of the deserted cinema)

Extending phone functionality:

status messages on phones

By the side of each of the names on your cell phone’s people list appears a status message: bored, busy, in transit etc.

Once people are logging their location in such a way that their friends can find them, you could be notified if your friends came within a mile radius of your current location

Parking space finding, homeless people are given free devices to log parking spaces as they become available (and receive pay­ment)

Entering a restaurant you see a huge burning skull in the middle of the room. Nobody else sees it. The skull was left at this geo­graphical location by one of your peer group indicating that the restaurant is terrible.

..a box in a room may have something in it even though it is empty.

wanting [emotional archaeology]

know when your friends are near

know when something happens close by

spontaneous organization and disorder flows

[everyone within a mile radius here now]

publish your morning walk somewhere

meeting places invisibly sign posted [skateboard here wednes­days]

uses beyond utility

[...]

know where the nearest starbucks or mcdonald’s is.

[...]

I want to find the echoes of the people who have been here before me

emotional archeology

geography adds a whole new dimension to the internet

information is actively overlaying real space

all the problems relating to building such an infrastructure have been reduced to resolution rather than possibility or plausibility.

but free, open, secure and contribution based ?

wireless castenada

invisible allies

trees hum

rooms answer questions about themselves

life flows into inanimate objects

its a weird occult project and nobody seems to have noticed

like all those roman gods for everything

society is actively looking for new ways to organise

Society is actively looking for new ways to organise, and ques­tioning ideas of value and exchange [inertia created by dominant power structures].

Location awareness offers a radical new way to organise and aug­ment communities.

a united states, freedom, representative democracy

There is an array of entirely new ways of doing things, and we’re just beginning to see that a lot of them can be linked together to make even newer ways of doing things.

The ideas behind the western representative democracies have not been allowed expression in terms of modern capabilities.

Those original ideas found expression in the structures that have come down to us, but those structures were defined in the context of the technological capabilities of the times.

Western representative democracies were fixed as a way of doing things at a point in time when reaching the place where discus­sions were held and decisions were made involved days or even weeks of travelling on horses. The only way to be represented was to send a representative.

Nobody seems to have noticed that conditions have changed, or at least they are unwilling to discuss reform.

the new economy

Things are still getting weirder.

The recent collapse of the new economy stocks, does not repre­sent the end of technological change.

The underlying value generated by the internet was not bound up in companies like amazon which hold up big signs that say ‘we are the internet’ (which they plainly are not) but in the broader effects on society and the economy of a wider range of com­munications technologies (the internet, email, web accessible databases, wireless communications) and wider access to, and applications of, those technologies.

The new economy fed off the experimentation of marginal com­munities (the military, academics, the open source community, the counter-culture and the porn industry) that were using the internet before the rest of the world got interested and who won’t stop working on what interests them because the stock market woke up to it’s own confusion.

From the point of view of the more interesting new economy experimentation, those years have been compared to the punk movement (in the sense that it gave people who would never otherwise have been in bands a chance to get up on stage and play ..however badly). The repercussions of punk are still being felt. The repercussions of the new economy with the subversive questions it raised (and to a large extent failed to answer) about how things could be done, who should have the power, what is valuable and where we should be going, are still to be determined.

The ongoing argument is a longer term one and it isn’t over. If nothing else the money didn’t all entirely disappear. Infrastructure, software and new ways of doing things are being absorbed by society and traditional industry.

..ten years ago no one had a cell phone, email or a web browser. You couldn’t find what you needed or talk to the people you wanted to talk to (and now you can), national boundaries were barriers to the flow of information.

..and the new stuff won’t go away just yet, because the money got spent, the infrastructure was bought and installed, and the system that allowed the whole thing to happen in the first place was designed to withstand a nuclear attack, a more serious threat than an economic slow down.

..if things can move just a little further ordinary people will find themselves with internet connected cell phones (high speed con­nections and fast processors) that know where they are.

Times have changed.

reinterpreting anarchy as a positive and constructive relative of heterarchy

Anarchy and heterarchy are potentially a state of grace rather than a grave synonym for destructive disorder.

Anarchy (the organisational idea rather than the usual associa­tions) has survived the 20th century in better shape than other ideological labels. Despite being branded with a raft of negative associations at the hands of centralising and controlling forces, and falling into the hands of the purely disruptive and destructive, anarchy (reinterpreted) potentially has something positive to say that new technological and social conditions finally make relevant.

A hybrid of heterarchy and anarchy could mean a network and infrastructure that would allow, integrated, but separate construc­tive communities to be autonomous, independent, interdependent, and free. A further iteration on the ideas of the founders of the united states for example.

Anarchy and heterarchy are brothers, and they do not, despite what you may have been told, necessarily mean you any harm. They can fix problems that other systems can only hide from.

prototyping future community

..follow the form of Dee Hock (the man behind Visa) and other radical but realistic thinkers, build a network of similarly motivated companies and financial services

make that network the corner stone of a community that will be able to keep it’s financial and non-financial transactions in line with a core of commonly held beliefs by keeping those transac­tions inside the community network.

This is an old idea, immigrant communities often semi-formalise the idea of keeping their dollars cir­culating inside their communities. Cooperative banks grew out of socialist ideas.

Make mobile and location aware devices an impor­tant part of your thinking.

[maybe find some next generation hardware and software, intended ultimately for general consumption, preferably at the point when it is being developed, tested and perfected and convince the developers to make your network its first customer].

Then conceive of this community in terms of a non-geographical state thats always locally aware, where membership gives you access not just to conventional services but also the rest of the community ..and the community infrastrucutre: experiment with new ideas of value and exchange, share houses, cars, food and ideas.

Potentially a digitally mediated 21st century extended commune

There are people who are quietly doing all this stuff.

..the same ideas could equally be employed by the Aryan nation.

better ways

Disenfranchised and alienated communities are suffering a huge and present hangover in the form of the blunt instruments of the 20th century. Money, mass production, centralisation, mass media focused on broadcasting rather than dialogue, government by force aligned to the threat of total war and nuclear annihilation, government sanctioned by a token vote every five years, govern­ment sustained by involuntary taxation.

 

It seems difficult to imagine these ideas being marginalised, but formerly dominant forces going much further back have been reduced to symbolic roles, displaced by new forms of social organisation rather than directly defeated.

Change for good is coming up with something better, not shouting abuse from the sidelines.

..its about plumbing, not revolution. Plumbing can be political, but its a largely inclusive form of politics.

Better means of exchange

Better community tools

Better interfaces to local spaces

revision note

..at the time of writing this partial revision of the original headmap manifesto there are an estimated 500,000 weblogs with Geourl place tags indicating their location. Thoughts implicitly associated with places

There are already geo-search engines mining these weblogs

You can search for sadness in New York.

The beginnings of the people level geomesh are already visible.

Ad hod wireless networks (technologies like Rendezvous). Tools for collaborating with others close by (like Hydra). Static wireless network nodes broadcasting positional information (RDF place feeds).

Proximity and position interacting.

There are tools on the way to the mainstream (already available) that will make creating personal place feeds easy for ordinary people. In fact using next generation of semantic web authoring and navigation tools (not relatives of conventional browsers – more like Mark Bernstein’s Tinderbox or Danny Ayers’ Ideagraph) adding a place attribute (geographic metadata) to any kind of data entity (email, images, notes, websites) will be easy for anyone.",<em>Headmap Manifesto</em>,,,2014-07-30T18:41:00+00:00,9,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/9,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=51,51,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T14:29:19+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Digital Art, Locative Media",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/51
