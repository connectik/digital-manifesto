,Global,Aaron Swartz,July 2008,"Written by Aaron Swarts in Eremo, Italy, in 2008, the <em>Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto</em> advocates for the liberation of academic research from private corporations. By declaring the formation of a 'open access movement,' Swartz outlines a number of possible avenues for accessing and sharing copy-righted information beyond the limitations of the companies that 'own' it.",,,EN,,,,,,,"<a href=""https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt"">https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt</a>","Open Access, Copy-left","Guerilla Open Access Manifesto 

Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves. The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the sciences? You'll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier. 

There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. Everything up until now will have been lost. 

That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? 
Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? It's outrageous and unacceptable. 

""I agree,"" many say, ""but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it's perfectly legal — there's nothing we can do to stop them."" But there is something we can, something that's already being done: we can fight back. 

Those with access to these resources — students, librarians, scientists — you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out. But you need not — indeed, morally, you cannot — keep this privilege for yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords with colleagues, filling download requests for friends. 


Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information locked up by the publishers and sharing them with your friends. 

But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. It's called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a 
ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn't immoral — it's a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy. 

Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which they operate require it — their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the politicians they  have bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who can make copies. 

There is no justice in following unjust laws. It's time to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture. 

We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need 
to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access. 

With enough of us, around the world, we'll not just send a strong message opposing the privatization of knowledge — we'll make it a thing of the past. Will you join us?

We've tried to ignore the problem... I tried to ignore the problem. I wanted to ignore the politics of the internet and, in many ways, politics itself. From a netizen point of view, Democracy often seems inefficient and ineffectual. But just because WE want to ignore it, doesn't mean politics wants to ignore us.

There are many groups who would subjugate us if they could. They would force us to pay every time we heard a song on the car radio, they would make sure we can't speak freely about their brand or their brand of government, they would exert complete control over our online existence.

As Netizens, we naively think that calmer heads will prevail and this has often been the case... but laws like SOPA and PIPA, which could potentially make the Patriot Act look tame if used to their fullest extent... continue to be paid for by big industry and pushed through congress. These acts are not just bad, they are unAmerican and more akin to something we would see in China or Iran... not here.

How does this happen? It's simple enough, Congressmen are paid to make laws that would oppress us. In the emerging world, this would be called ""Corruption""... here it's called ""Contribution"". It's easy. These laws are complicated and their most of their constituents don't even know that their congressmen are involved or how these laws would affect them. The industries behind these laws are wealthy and spend lavishly on representatives willing to support them. Most importantly... there is little to no political pain for these representatives. They fill their campaign coffers with cash... if the bill fails, they keep the cash and it's quickly forgotten. If the bill passes, they'll get more money next year. 

This needs to stop.

We can no longer expect our representatives, many of whom couldn't write an email on their own, to represent us without firm action. We can no longer depend on OUR means of discussion - Facebook, Twitter, and Email -l to express ourselves.

We need to fight these laws, and the lawmakers that would pass them, in their back yard. We need to earn their respect, and fear if necessary. We need them to know that supporting these bills has a political cost.

We need a sort of ""Internet Protection Fund"", a PAC, that is designed for a single purpose - To use every legal means to attack those who would attack us. To bring the fight to to their doorstep, their airwaves, and their TVs. We need to organize and focus the resistance. 

Step 1 - Stop the SOPA and PIPA before they are passed through targeted boycotts, information campaigns, and letter writing campaigns.

Step 2 - Target those in Congress who support these bills and attempt to unseat them in the fall with internet, grassroots, TV and Radio campaigns. Congress needs to know that supporting these bills is no longer a blank check...it's no longer safe.

Step 3 - We need to build our organization BETWEEN elections, build its resources, and build its capacity to defend our rights... aggressively. This fight is about to intensify as the information age matures. We need to begin to take an active role in shaping our online future.

This is not a replacement for organizations like the Electronic Freedom Foundation... without whom we will be already be in virtual chains. This is the sharp end of the stick that comes when they are not able to negotiate our freedom. These are the troops that back up the political discussions with real, tangible, action. 

This is not a replacement for Anonymous. They play harder than we will. We will keep our fight within the confines of the current laws. We will use every means within those laws to express the will of those we represent but we will stay well within the confines of the current rules. 

We will play by the political rules that our opponents play by... not the ones we wish they would play. We will use our skills, connections and ability to organize online but we will bring this fight to their field and beat them there.

So now what do we do? 

Step one: +1 this post and pass it on. If there is enough interest, the next steps will be somewhat obvious (begin the organization structure). Comment and let me know what you think and what you would do next. If there is enough interest... more posts will follow.﻿",<em>The Manifesto</em>,,,,2014-06-01T23:23:28+00:00,1,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/1,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=4,4,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-25T21:24:37+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,SOPA,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/4

        Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.  ""Teenager
Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal"", ""Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering""...
        Damn kids.  They're all alike.

        But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain,
ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
        I am a hacker, enter my world...
        Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of
the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...
        Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.

        I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers explain
for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  ""No, Ms.
Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in my head...""
        Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all alike.

        I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is
cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...
                Or feels threatened by me...
                Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
                Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
        Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.

        And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through
the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is
sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is
found.
        ""This is it... this is where I belong...""
        I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to
them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...
        Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.  They're all alike...

        You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at
school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip
through were pre-chewed and tasteless.  We've been dominated by sadists, or
ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to teach found us will-
ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.

        This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and

        Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me
for.

Several of you at the ""physical Cypherpunks"" gathering yesterday in Silicon Valley requested that more of the material passed out in meetings be available electronically to the entire readership of the Cypherpunks list, spooks, eavesdroppers, and all. <Gulp>

Here's the ""Crypto Anarchist Manifesto"" I read at the September 1992 founding meeting. It dates back to mid-1988 and was distributed to some like-minded techno-anarchists at the ""Crypto '88"" conference and then again at the ""Hackers Conference"" that year. I later gave talks at Hackers on this in 1989 and 1990.

There are a few things I'd change, but for historical reasons I'll just leave it as is. Some of the terms may be unfamiliar to you...I hope the Crypto Glossary I just distributed will help.

The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto

Timothy C. May <tcmay@netcom.com>
A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.

Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re- routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.

The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now been on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under development will be some of the enabling technologies.

The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.

Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.

Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!

McKenzie Wark

Manifestation

01. There is a double spooking the world, the double of abstraction. The fortunes of states and armies, companies and communities depend on it. All contending classes - the landlords and farmers, the workers and capitalists - revere yet fear the relentless abstraction of the world on which their fortunes yet depend. All the classes but one. The hacker class.

02. Whatever code we hack, be it programming language, poetic language, math or music, curves or colourings, we create the possibility of new things entering the world. Not always great things, or even good things, but new things. In art, in science, in philosophy and culture, in any production of knowledge where data can be gathered, where information can be extracted from it, and where in that information new possibilities for the world are produced, there are hackers hacking the new out of the old. While hackers create these new worlds, we do not possess them. That which we create is mortgaged to others, and to the interests of others, to states and corporations who control the means for making worlds we alone discover. We do not own what we produce - it owns us.

03. And yet we don't quite know who we are. While we recognise our distinctive existence as a group, as programmers, as artists or writers or scientists or musicians, we rarely see these ways of representing ourselves as mere fragments of a class experience that is still struggling to express itself as itself, as expressions of the process of producing abstraction in the world. Geeks and freaks become what they are negatively, through their exclusion by others. Hackers are a class, but an abstract class, a class as yet to hack itself into manifest existence as itself.

Abstraction

04. Abstraction may be discovered or produced, may be material or immaterial, but abstraction is what every hack produces and affirms. To abstract is to construct a plane upon which otherwise different and unrelated matters may be brought into many possible relations. It is through the abstract that the virtual is identified, produced and released. The virtual is not just the potential latent in matters, it is the potential of potential. To hack is to produce or apply the abstract to information and express the possibility of new worlds.

05. All abstractions are abstractions of nature. To abstract is to express the virtuality of nature, to make known some instance of its manifold possibilities, to actualise a relation out of infinite relationality. Abstractions release the potential of physical matter. And yet abstraction relies on something that has an independent existence to physical matter -- information. Information is no less real than physical matter, and is dependent on it for its existence. Since information cannot exist in a pure, immaterial form, neither can the hacker class. Of necessity it must deal with a ruling class that owns the material means of extracting or distributing information, or with a producing class that extracts and distributes. The class interest of hackers lies in freeing information from its material constraints.

06. As the abstraction of private property was extended to information, it produced the hacker class as a class. Hackers must sell their capacity for abstraction to a class that owns the means of production, the vectoralist class - the emergent ruling class of our time. The vectorialist class is waging an intensive struggle to dispossess hackers of their intellectual property. Patents and copyrights all end up in the hands, not of their creators, but of the vectoralist class that owns the means of realising the value of these abstractions. The vectoralist class struggles to monopolise abstraction. Hackers find themselves dispossessed both individually, and as a class. Hackers come piecemeal to struggle against the particular forms in which abstraction is commodified and made into the private property of the vectoralist class. Hackers come to struggle collectively against the usurious charges the vectoralists extort for access to the information that hackers collectively produce, but that vectoralists collectively come to own. Hackers come as a class to recognise their class interest is best expressed through the struggle to free the production of abstraction not just from the particular fetters of this or that form of property, but to abstract the form of property itself.

07. What makes our times different is that what now appears on the horizon is the possibility of a society finally set free from necessity, both real and imagined, by an explosion in abstract innovations. Abstraction with the potential once and for all to break the shackles holding hacking fast to outdated and regressive class interests. The time is past due when hackers must come together with all of the producing classes of the world - to liberate productive and inventive resources from the myth of scarcity. ""The world already possesses the dream of a time whose consciousness it must now possess in order to actually live it.""

Production

08. Production produces all things, and all producers of things. Production produces not only the object of the production process, but also the producer as subject. Hacking is the production of production. The hack produces a production of a new kind, which has as its result a singular and unique product, and a singular and unique producer. Every hacker is at one and the same time producer and product of the hack, and emerges in its singularity as the memory of the hack as process.

09. Production takes place on the basis of a prior hack which gives to production its formal, social, repeatable and reproducible form. Every production is a hack formalised and repeated on the basis of its representation. To produce is to repeat; to hack, to differentiate.

10. The hack produces both a useful and a useless surplus, although the usefulness of any surplus is socially and historically determined. The useful surplus goes into expanding the realm of freedom wrested from necessity. The useless surplus is the surplus of freedom itself, the margin of free production unconstrained by production for necessity.

11. The production of a surplus creates the possibility of the expansion of freedom from necessity. But in class society, the production of a surplus also creates new necessities. Class domination takes the form of the capture of the productive potential of society and its harnessing to the production, not of liberty, but of class domination itself. The ruling class subordinates the hack to the production of forms of production that may be harnessed to the enhancement of class power, and the suppression or marginalisation of other forms of hacking. What the producing classes - farmers, workers and hackers - have in common is an interest in freeing production from its subordination to ruling classes who turn production into the production of new necessities, who wrest slavery from surplus. The elements of a free productivity exist already in an atomised form, in the productive classes. What remains is the release of its virtuality.

Class

12. The class struggle, in its endless setbacks, reversals and compromises returns again and again to the unanswered question - property - and the contending classes return again and again with new answers. The working class questioned the necessity of private property, and the communist party arose, claiming to answer the desires of the working class. The answer, expressed in the Communist Manifesto was to ""centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the state."" But making the state the monopolist of property has only produced a new ruling class, and a new and more brutal class struggle. But perhaps this was not the final answer, and the course of the class struggle is not yet over. Perhaps there is another class that can pose the property question in a new way - and offer new answers to breaking the monopoly of the ruling classes on property.

13. There is a class dynamic driving each stage of the development of the vectoral world in which we now find ourselves. The pastoralist class disperse the great mass of peasants who traditionally worked the land under the thumb of feudal landlords. The pastoralists supplant the feudal landlords, releasing the productivity of the land which they claim as their private property. As new forms of abstraction make it possible to produce a surplus from the land with fewer and fewer farmers, pastoralists turn them off their land, depriving them of their living. Dispossessed farmers seek work and a new home in cities. Here farmers become workers, as capital puts them to work in its factories. Capital as property gives rise to a class of capitalists who own the means of production, and a class of workers, dispossessed of it - and by it. Dispossessed farmers become workers, only to be dispossessed again. Having lost their land, they lose in turn their culture. Capital produces in its factories not just the necessities of existence, but a way of life it expects its workers to consume. Commodified life dispossess the worker of the information traditionally passed on outside the realm of private property as culture, as the gift of one generation to the next, and replaces it with information in commodified form.

14. Information, like land or capital, becomes a form of property monopolised by a class of vectoralists, so named because they control the vectors along which information is abstracted, just as capitalists control the material means with which goods are produced, and pastoralists the land with which food is produced. Information circulated within working class culture as a social property belonging to all. But when information in turn becomes a form of private property, workers are dispossessed of it, and must buy their own culture back from its owners, the vectoralist class. The whole of time, time itself, becomes a commodified experience.

15. Vectoralists try to break capital's monopoly on the production process, and subordinate the production of goods to the circulation of information. The leading corporations divest themselves of their productive capacity, as this is no longer a source of power. Their power lies in monopolising intellectual property - patents and brands - and the means of reproducing their value - the vectors of communication. The privatisation of information becomes the dominant, rather than a subsidiary, aspect of commodified life. As private property advances from land to capital to information, property itself becomes more abstract. As capital frees land from its spatial fixity, information as property frees capital from its fixity in a particular object.

16. The hacker class, producer of new abstractions, becomes more important to each successive ruling class, as each depends more and more on information as a resource. The hacker class arises out of the transformation of information into property, in the form of intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyright and the moral right of authors. The hacker class is the class with the capacity to create not only new kinds of object and subject in the world, not only new kinds of property form in which they may be represented, but new kinds of relation beyond the property form. The formation of the hacker class as a class comes at just this moment when freedom from necessity and from class domination appears on the horizon as a possibility.

Property

17. Property constitutes an abstract plane upon which all things may be things with one quality in common, the quality of property. Land is the primary form of property. Pastoralists acquire land as private property through the forced dispossession of peasants who once shared a portion of it in a form of public ownership. Capital is the secondary form of property, the privatisation of productive assets in the form of tools, machines and working materials. Capital, unlike land, is not in fixed supply or disposition. It can be made and remade, moved, aggregated and dispersed. An infinitely greater degree of potential can be released from the world as a productive resource once the abstract plane of property includes both land and capital - such is capital's 'advance'.

18. The capitalist class recognises the value of the hack in the abstract, whereas the pastoralists were slow to appreciate the productivity that can flow from the application of abstraction to the production process. Under the influence of capital, the state sanctions forms of intellectual property, such as patents and copyrights, that secure an independent existence for hackers as a class, and a flow of innovations in culture as well as science from which development issues. Information, once it becomes a form of property, develops beyond a mere support for capital - it becomes the basis of a form of accumulation in its own right.

19. Hackers must calculate their interests not as owners, but as producers, for this is what distinguishes them from the vectoralist class. Hackers do not merely own, and profit by owning information. They produce new information, and as producers need access to it free from the absolute domination of the commodity form. Hacking as a pure, free experimental activity must be free from any constraint that is not self imposed. Only out of its liberty will it produce the means of producing a surplus of liberty and liberty as a surplus.

20. Private property arose in opposition not only to feudal property, but also to traditional forms of the gift economy, which were a fetter to the increased productivity of the commodity economy. Qualitative, gift exchange was superseded by quantified, monetised exchange. Money is the medium through which land, capital, information and labour all confront each other as abstract entities, reduced to an abstract plane of measurement. The gift becomes a marginal form of property, everywhere invaded by the commodity, and turned towards mere consumption. The gift is marginal, but nevertheless plays a vital role in cementing reciprocal and communal relations among people who otherwise can only confront each other as buyer and sellers of commodities. As vectoral production develops, the means appear for the renewal of the gift economy. Everywhere that the vector reaches, it brings into the orbit of the commodity. But everywhere the vector reaches, it also brings with it the possibility of the gift relation.

21. The hacker class has a close affinity with the gift economy. The hacker struggles to produce a subjectivity that is qualitative and singular, in part through the act of the hack itself. The gift, as a qualitative exchange between singular parties allows each party to be recognised as a singular producer, as a subject of production, rather than as a commodified and quantified object. The gift expresses in a social and collective way the subjectivity of the production of production, whereas commodified property represents the producer as an object, a quantifiable commodity like any other, of relative value only. The gift of information need not give rise to conflict over information as property, for information need not suffer the artifice of scarcity once freed from commodification.

22. The vectoralist class contributed, unwittingly, to the development of the vectoral space within which the gift as property could return, but quickly recognised its error. As the vectoral economy develops, less and less of it takes the form of a social space of open and free gift exchange, and more and more of it takes the form of commodified production for private sale. The vectoralist class can grudgingly accommodate some margin of socialised information, as the price it pays in a democracy for the furtherance of its main interests. But the vectoralist class quite rightly sees in the gift a challenge not just to its profits but to its very existence. The gift economy is the virtual proof for the parasitic and superfluous nature of vectoralists as a class.

Vector

23. In epidemiology, a vector is the particular means by which a given pathogen travels from one population to another. Water is a vector for cholera, bodily fluids for HIV. By extension, a vector may be any means by which information moves. Telegraph, telephone, television, telecommunications: these terms name not just particular vectors, but a general abstract capacity that they bring into the world and expand. All are forms of telesthesia, or perception at a distance. A given media vector has certain fixed properties of speed, bandwidth, scope and scale, but may be deployed anywhere, at least in principle. The uneven development of the vector is political and economic, not technical.

24. With the commodification of information comes its vectoralisation. Extracting a surplus from information requires technologies capable of transporting information through space, but also through time. The archive is a vector through time just as communication is a vector that crosses space. The vectoral class comes into its own once it is in possession of powerful technologies for vectoralising information. The vectoral class may commodify information stocks, flows, or vectors themselves. A stock of information is an archive, a body of information maintained through time that has enduring value. A flow of information is the capacity to extract information of temporary value out of events and to distribute it widely and quickly. A vector is the means of achieving either the temporal distribution of a stock, or the spatial distribution of a flow of information. Vectoral power is generally sought through the ownership of all three aspects.

25. The vectoral class ascend to the illusion of an instantaneous and global plane of calculation and control. But it is not the vectoralist class that comes to hold subjective power over the objective world. The vector itself usurps the subjective role, becoming the sole repository of will toward a world that can be apprehended only in its commodified form. The reign of the vector is one in which any and every thing can be apprehended as a thing. The vector is a power over all of the world, but a power that is not evenly distributed. Nothing in the technology of the vector determines its possible use. All that is determined by the technology is the form in which information is objectified.

26. The vectoral class struggles at every turn to maintain its subjective power over the vector, but as it continues to profit by the proliferation of the vector, some capacity over it always escapes control. In order to market and profit by the information it peddles over the vector, it must in some degree address the vast majority of the producing classes as subjects, rather than as objects of commodification. The hacker class seeks the liberation of the vector from the reign of the commodity, but not to set it indiscriminately free. Rather, to subject it to collective and democratic development. The hacker class can release the virtuality of the vector only in principle. It is up to an alliance of all the productive classes to turn that potential to actuality, to organise themselves subjectively, and use the available vectors for a collective and subjective becoming.

Education

27. Education is slavery, it enchains the mind and makes it a resource for class power. When the ruling class preaches the necessity of an education it invariably means an education in necessity. Education is not the same as knowledge. Nor is it the necessary means to acquire knowledge. Education is the organisation of knowledge within the constraints of scarcity. Education 'disciplines' knowledge, segregating it into homogenous 'fields', presided over by suitably 'qualified' guardians charged with policing the representation of the field. One may acquire an education, as if it were a thing, but one becomes knowledgeable, through a process of transformation. Knowledge, as such, is only ever partially captured by education, its practice always eludes and exceeds it.

28. The pastoralist class has resisted education, other than as indoctrination in obedience. When capital required 'hands' to do its dirty work, the bulk of education was devoted to training useful hands to tend the machines, and docile bodies who would accept as natural the social order in which they found themselves. When capital required brains, both to run its increasingly complex operations and to apply themselves to the work of consuming its products, more time spent in the prison house of education was required for admission to the ranks of the paid working class.

29. The so-called middle class achieve their privileged access to consumption and security through education, in which they are obliged to invest a substantial part of their income. But most remain workers, even though they work with information rather than cotton or metal. They work in factories, but are trained to think of them as offices. They take home wages, but are trained to think of it as a salary. They wear a uniform, but are trained to think of it as a suit. The only difference is that education has taught them to give different names to the instruments of exploitation, and to despise those their own class who name them differently.

30. Where the capitalist class sees education as a means to an end, the vectoralist class sees it as an end in itself. It sees opportunities to make education a profitable industry in its own right, based on the securing of intellectual property as a form of private property. To the vectoralists, education, like culture, is just 'content' for commodification.

31. The hacker class have an ambivalent relationship to education. The hacker class desires knowledge, not education. The hacker comes into being though the pure liberty of knowledge in and of itself. The hack expresses knowledge in its virtuality, by producing new abstractions that do not necessarily fit the disciplinary regime of managing and commodifying education. . Hacker knowledge implies, in its practice, a politics of free information, free learning, the gift of the result to a network of peers. Hacker knowledge also implies an ethics of knowledge subject to the claims of public interest and free from subordination to commodity production. This puts the hacker into an antagonistic relationship to the struggle of the capitalist class to make education an induction into wage slavery.

32. Only one intellectual conflict has any real bearing on the class issue for hackers: Whose property is knowledge? Is it the role of knowledge to authorise subjects through education that are recognised only by their function in an economy by manipulating its authorised representations as objects? Or is it the function of knowledge to produce the ever different phenomena of the hack, in which subjects become other than themselves, and discover the objective world to contain potentials other than it appears?

Hacking

33. The virtual is the true domain of the hacker. It is from the virtual that the hacker produces ever-new expressions of the actual. To the hacker, what is represented as being real is always partial, limited, perhaps even false. To the hacker there is always a surplus of possibility expressed in what is actual, the surplus of the virtual. This is the inexhaustible domain of what is real without being actual, what is not but which may be. To hack is to release the virtual into the actual, to express the difference of the real.

34. Through the application of abstraction, the hacker class produces the possibility of production, the possibility of making something of and with the world - and of living off the surplus produced by the application of abstraction to nature - to any nature. Through the production of new forms of abstraction, the hacker class produces the possibility of the future - not just 'the' future, but an infinite possible array of futures, the future itself as virtuality.

35. Under the sanction of law, the hack becomes a finite property, and the hacker class emerges, as all classes emerge, out of a relation to a property form. Like all forms of property, intellectual property enforces a relation of scarcity. It assigns a right to a property to an owner at the expense of non-owners, to a class of possessors at the expense of the dispossessed.

36. By its very nature, the act of hacking overcomes the limits property imposes on it. New hacks supersede old hacks, and devalues them as property. The hack as new information is produced out of already existing information. This gives the hacker class an interest in its free availability more than in an exclusive right. The immaterial nature of information means that the possession by one of information need not deprive another of it.

37. To the extent that the hack embodies itself in the form of property, it gives the hacker class interests quite different from other classes, be they exploiting or exploited classes. The interest of the hacker class lies first and foremost in a free circulation of information, this being the necessary condition for the renewed statement of the hack. But the hacker class as class also has an interest in the representation of the hack as property, as something from which a source of income may be derived that gives the hacker some independence from the ruling classes.

38. The very nature of the hack gives the hacker a crisis of identity. The hacker searches for a representation of what it is to be a hacker in the identities of other classes. Some see themselves as vectoralists, trading on the scarcity of their property. Some see themselves as workers, but as privileged ones in a hierarchy of wage earners. The hacker class has produces itself as itself, but not for itself. It does not (yet) possess a consciousness of its consciousness. It is not aware of its own virtuality. It has to distinguish between its competitive interest in the hack, and its collective interest in discovering a relation among hackers that expresses an open and ongoing future.

Information

39. Information wants to be free but is everywhere in chains. Information is the potential of potential. When unfettered it releases the latent capacities of all things and people, objects and subjects. Information is indeed the very potential for there to be objects and subjects. It is the medium in which objects and subjects actually come into existence, and is the medium in which their virtuality resides. When information is not free, then the class that owns or controls it turns its capacity toward its own interest and away from its own inherent virtuality.

40. Information has nothing to do with communication, or with media. ""We do not lack communication. On the contrary, we have too much of it. We lack creation. We lack resistance to the present."" Information is precisely this resistance, this friction. At the urgings of the vectoralist class, the state recognises as property any communication, any media product with some minimal degree of difference recognisable in commodity exchange. Where communication merely requires the repetition of this commodified difference, information is the production of the difference of difference.

41. The arrest of the free flow of information means the enslavement of the world to the interests of those who profit from information's scarcity, the vectoral class. The enslavement of information means the enslavement of its producers to the interests of its owners. It is the hacker class that taps the virtuality of information, but it is the vectoralist class that owns and controls the means of production of information on an industrial scale. Privatising culture, education and communication as commodified content, distorts and deforms its free development, and prevents the very concept of its freedom from its own free development. While information remains subordinated to ownership, it is not possible for its producers to freely calculate their interests, or to discover what the true freedom of information might potentially produce in the world.

42. Free information must be free in all its aspects - as a stock, as a flow, and as a vector. The stock of information is the raw material out of which history is abstracted. The flow of information is the raw material out of which the present is abstracted, a present that forms the horizon the abstract line of an historical knowledge crosses, indicating a future in its sights. Neither stocks nor flows of information exist without vectors along which they may be actualised. The spatial and temporal axes of free information must do more offer a representation of things, as a thing apart. They must become the means of coordination of the statement of a movement, at once objective and subjective, capable of connecting the objective representation of things to the presentation of a subjective action.

43. It is not just information that must be free, but the knowledge of how to use it. Information in itself is a mere thing. It requires an active, subjective capacity to become productive. Information is free not for the purpose of representing the world perfectly, but for expressing its difference from what is, and for expressing the cooperative force that transforms what is into what may be. The test of a free society is not the liberty to consume information, nor to produce it, nor even to implement its potential in private world of one's choosing. The test of a free society is the liberty for the collective transformation of the world through abstractions freely chosen and freely actualised.

Representation

44. All representation is false. A likeness differs of necessity from what it represents. If it did not, it would be what it represents, and thus not a representation. The only truly false representation is the belief in the possibility of true representation. Critique is not a solution, but the problem itself. Critique is a police action in representation, of service only to the maintenance of the value of property through the establishment of its value.

45. The politics of representation is always the politics of the state. The state is nothing but the policing of representation's adequacy to the body of what it represents. Even in its most radical form, the politics of representation always presupposes an abstract or ideal state that would act as guarantor of its chosen representations. It yearns for a state that would recognise this oppressed ethnicity, or sexuality, but which is nevertheless still a desire for a state, and a state that, in the process, is not challenged as an statement of class interest, but is accepted as the judge of representation.

46. And always, what is excluded even from this enlightened, imaginary state, would be those who refuse representation, namely, the hacker class as a class. To hack is to refuse representation, to make matters express themselves otherwise. To hack is always to produce a difference, if only a minute difference, in the production of information. To hack is to trouble the object or the subject, by transforming in some way the very process of production by which objects and subjects come into being and recognise each other by their representations.

47. The politics of information, of knowledge, advances not through a critical negation of false representations but a positive politics of the virtuality of statement. The inexhaustible surplus of statement is that aspect of information upon which the class interest of hackers depends. Hacking brings into existence the inexhaustible multiplicity of all codes, be they natural or social, programmed or poetic. But as it is the act of hacking that composes, at one and the same time, the hacker and the hack, hacking recognises no artificial scarcity, no official licence, no credentialing police force other than that composed by the gift economy among hackers themselves.

48. A politics that embraces its existence as statement, as affirmative difference, not as negation can escape the politics of the state. To ignore or plagiarise representation, to refuse to give it what it claims as its due, is to begin a politics of statelessness. A politics which refuses the state's authority to authorise what is a valued statement and what isn't. A politics which is always temporary, always becoming something other than itself. Even useless hacks may come, perversely enough, to be valued for the purity of their uselessness. There is nothing that can't be valued as a representation. The hack always has to move on.

49. Everywhere dissatisfaction with representations is spreading. Sometimes its a matter of breaking a few shop windows, sometimes of breaking a few heads. So-called 'violence' against the state, which rarely amounts to more than throwing rocks at its police, is merely the desire for the state expressed in its masochistic form. Where some call for a state that recognises their representation, others call for a state that beats them to a pulp. Neither is a politics that escapes the desire cultivated within the subject by the educational apparatus.

50. Sometimes direct democracy is posited as the alternative. But this merely changes the moment of representation - it puts politics in the hands of claimants to an activist representation, in place of an electoral one.. Sometimes what is demanded of the politics of representation is that it recognise a new subject. Minorities of race, gender, preference demand the right to representation. But soon enough they discover the cost. They must now police the meaning of this representation, and police the adherence of its members to it. Even at its best, in its most abstract form, on its best behaviour, the colour blind, gender neutral, multicultural state just hands the value of representation over to the commodity form. While this is progress, particularly for those formerly oppressed by the state's failure to recognise their identity as legitimate, it stops short at the recognition of expressions of subjectivity that seeks to become something other than a representation that the state can recognise and the market can value.

51. But there is something else hovering on the horizon of the representable. There is a politics of the unrepresentable, a politics of the presentation of the non-negotiable demand. This is politics as the refusal of representation itself, not the politics of refusing this or that representation. A politics which, while abstract, is not utopian. In its infinite and limitless demand, it may even be the best way of extracting concessions precisely through its refusal to put a name - or a price - on what revolt desires.

Revolt

52. The revolts of 1989 are the signal events of our time. What the revolts of 1989 achieved was the overthrow of regimes so impervious to the recognition of the value of the hack that they had starved not only their hackers but also their workers and farmers of any increase in the surplus. With their cronyism and kleptocracy, their bureaucracy and ideology, their police and spies, they starved even their pastoralists and capitalists of innovative transformation and growth.

53. The revolts of 1989 overthrew boredom and necessity. At least for a time. They put back on the world historical agenda the limitless demand for free statement. At least for a time. They revealed the latent destiny of world history to express the pure virtuality of becoming. At least for a time, before new states cobbled themselves together and claimed legitimacy as representations of what revolt desired. The revolts of 1989 opened the portal to the virtual, but the states that regrouped around this opening soon closed it. What the revolts really achieved was the making of the world safe for vectoral power.

54. The so-called anti-globalisation protests of the 90s are a ripple caused by the wake of these signal events, but a ripple that did not know the current to which it truly belonged. This movement of revolt in the overdeveloped world identifies the rising vectoral power as a class enemy, but all too often it allowed itself to be captured by the partial and temporary interests of local capitalist and pastoralist classes. It was a revolt is in its infancy that has yet to discover the connection between its engine of limitless desire and free statement, and the art of making tactical demands.

55. The class struggle within nations and the imperial struggle between nations has taken shape as two forms of politics. One kind of politics is regressive. It seeks to return to an imagined past. It seeks to use national borders as a new wall, a neon screen behind which unlikely alliances might protect their existing interests in the name of a glorious past. The other form is the progressive politics of movement. The politics of movement seeks to accelerate toward an unknown future. It seeks to use international flows of information, trade or activism as the eclectic means for struggling for new sources of wealth or liberty that overcomes the limitations imposed by national coalitions.

56. Neither of these politics corresponds to the old notion of a left or right, which the revolutions of 1989 have definitively overcome. Regressive politics brings together luddite impulses from the left with racist and reactionary impulses from the right in an unholy alliance against new sources of power. Progressive politics rarely takes the form of an alliance, but constitutes two parallel processes locked in a dialogue of mutual suspicion, in which the liberalising forces of the right and the social justice and human rights forces of the left both seek non-national and transnational solutions to unblocking the system of power which still accumulates at the national level.

57. There is a third politics, which stands outside the alliances and compromises of the post-89 world. Where both progressive and regressive politics are representative politics, which deal with aggregate party alliances and interests, this third politics is a stateless politics, which seeks escape from politics as such. A politics of the hack, inventing relations outside of representation.

58. Expressive politics is a struggle against commodity property itself. Expressive politics is not the struggle to collectivise property, for that is still a form of property. Expressive politics is the struggle to free what can be free from both versions of the commodity form - its totalising market form, and its bureaucratic state form. What may be free from the commodity form altogether is not land, not capital, but information. All other forms of property are exclusive. The ownership by one excludes, by definition, the ownership by another. But information as property may be shared without diminishing anything but its scarcity. Information is that which can escape the commodity form.

59. Politics can become expressive only when it is a politics of freeing the virtuality of information. In liberating information from its objectification as a commodity, it liberates also the subjective force of statement. Subject and object meet each other outside of their mere lack of each other, by their desire merely for each other. Expressive politics does not seek to overthrow the existing society, or to reform its larger structures, or to preserve its structure so as to maintain an existing coalition of interests. It seeks to permeate existing states with a new state of existence, spreading the seeds of an alternative practice of everyday life.

1
Slow Blogging is a rejection of immediacy. It is an affirmation that not all things worth reading are written quickly, and that many thoughts are best served after being fully baked and worded in an even temperament.  

2
Slow Blogging is speaking like it matters, like the pixels that give your words form are precious and rare. It is a willingness to let current events pass without comment. It is deliberate in its pace, breaking its unhurried stride for nothing short of true emergency. And perhaps not even then, for slow is not the speed of most emergencies, and places where beloved, reassuring speed rules the day will serve us best at those times. 

3
Slow Blogging is a reversal of the disintegration into the one-liners and cutting turns of phrase that are often the early lives of our best ideas. Its a process in which flashes of thought shine and then fade to take their place in the background as part of something larger. Slow Blogging does not write thoughts onto the ethereal and eternal parchment before they provide an enduring worth in the shape of our ideas over time. 

4
Slow Blogging is a willingness to remain silent amid the daily outrages and ecstasies that fill nothing more than single moments in time, switching between banality, crushing heartbreak and end-of-the-world psychotic glee in the mere space between headlines. The thing you wished you said in the moment last week can be said next month, or next year, and you’ll only look all the smarter. 

5
Slow Blogging is a response to and a rejection of Pagerank. Pagerank, the ugly-beautiful monster that sits behind the many folded curtains of Google, deciding the question of authority and relevance to your searches. Blog early, blog often, and Google will reward you. Condition your creative self to the secret frequency, and find yourself adored by Google; you will appear where everybody looks – in the first few pages of results. Follow your own pace and find your works never found; refuse Pagerank its favours and your work is pulled as if by riptide into the deep waters of undifferentiated results. Its twisted idea of the common good has made Pagerank a terrifying enemy of the commons, setting a pace that forbids the reflection that is necessary to move past the day to day and into legacy.

6
Slow Blogging is the re-establishment of the machine as the agent of human expression, rather than its whip and container. It’s the voluntary halting of the light-speed hamster wheel dictated in rules of highly effective  blogging. It is an imposition of asynchronous temporalities, where we do not type faster to keep up with the computer, where the speed of retrieval does not necessitate the same pace of consumption, where good and bad works are created in their own time.

Weblog Ethics

Weblogs are the mavericks of the online world. Two of their greatest strengths are their ability to filter and disseminate information to a widely dispersed audience, and their position outside the mainstream of mass media. Beholden to no one, weblogs point to, comment on, and spread information according to their own, quirky criteria.

The weblog network's potential influence may be the real reason mainstream news organizations have begun investigating the phenomenon, and it probably underlies much of the talk about weblogs as journalism. Webloggers may not think in terms of control and influence, but commercial media do. Mass media seeks, above all, to gain a wide audience. Advertising revenues, the lifeblood of any professional publication or broadcast, depend on the size of that publication's audience. Content, from a business standpoint, is there only to deliver eyeballs to advertisers, whether the medium is paper or television.

Journalists — the people who actually report the news — are acutely aware of the potential for abuse that is inherent in their system, which relies on support from businesses and power brokers, each with an agenda to promote. Their ethical standards are designed to delineate the journalist's responsibilities and provide a clear code of conduct that will ensure the integrity of the news.

Weblogs, produced by nonprofessionals, have no such code, and individual webloggers seem almost proud of their amateur status. ""We don't need no stinkin' fact checkers"" seems to be the prevailing attitude, as if inaccuracy were a virtue.

“ Let me propose a radical notion: The weblog's greatest strength — its uncensored, unmediated, uncontrolled voice — is also its greatest weakness. ”

Let me propose a radical notion: The weblog's greatest strength — its uncensored, unmediated, uncontrolled voice — is also its greatest weakness. News outlets may be ultimately beholden to advertising interests, and reporters may have a strong incentive for remaining on good terms with their sources in order to remain in the loop; but because they are businesses with salaries to pay, advertisers to please, and audiences to attract and hold, professional news organizations have a vested interest in upholding certain standards so that readers keep subscribing and advertisers keep buying. Weblogs, with only minor costs and little hope of significant financial gain, have no such incentives.

The very things that may compromise professional news outlets are at the same time incentives for some level of journalistic standards. And the very things that make weblogs so valuable as alternative news sources — the lack of gatekeepers and the freedom from all consequences — may compromise their integrity and thus their value. There is every indication that weblogs will gain even greater influence as their numbers grow and awareness of the form becomes more widespread. It is not true, as some people assert, that the network will route around misinformation, or that the truth is always filtered to widespread awareness. Rumors spread because they are fun to pass along. Corrections rarely gain much traction either in the real world or online; they just aren't as much fun.

There has been almost no talk about ethics in the weblog universe: Mavericks are notoriously resistant to being told what to do. But I would propose a set of six rules that I think form a basis of ethical behavior for online publishers of all kinds.1 I hope that the weblog community will thoughtfully consider the principles outlined here; in time, and with experience, the community may see the need to add to these rules or to further codify our standards. At the very least, I hope these principles will spur discussion about our responsibilities and the ramifications of our collective behavior.

“Each of these suggestions attempts to bring transparency — one of the weblog's distinguishing characteristics and greatest strengths — into every aspect of the practice of weblogging. ”
Journalistic codes of ethics seek to ensure fairness and accuracy in news reporting. By comparison, each of these suggestions attempts to bring transparency — one of the weblog's distinguishing characteristics and greatest strengths — into every aspect of the practice of weblogging. It is unrealistic to expect every weblogger to present an even-handed picture of the world, but it is very reasonable to expect them to be forthcoming about their sources, biases, and behavior.

Webloggers who, despite my best efforts, persist in their quest to be regarded as journalists will have a special interest in adhering to these principles. News organizations may someday be willing to point to weblogs (or weblog entries) as serious sources, but only if weblogs have, as a whole, demonstrated integrity in their information gathering and dissemination, and consistency in their online conduct.
Any weblogger who expects to be accorded the privileges and protections of a professional journalist will need to go further than these principles. Rights have associated responsibilities; in the end it is an individual's professionalism and meticulous observance of recognized ethical standards that determines her status in the eyes of society and the law. For the rest of us, I believe the following standards are sufficient:

1. Publish as fact only that which you believe to be true.

If your statement is speculation, say so. If you have reason to believe that something is not true, either don't post it, or note your reservations. When you make an assertion, do so in good faith; state it as fact only if, to the best of your knowledge, it is so.

2. If material exists online, link to it when you reference it.

Linking to referenced material allows readers to judge for themselves the accuracy and insightfulness of your statements. Referencing material but selectively linking only that with which you agree is manipulative. Online readers deserve, as much as possible, access to all of the facts — the Web, used this way, empowers readers to become active, not passive, consumers of information. Further, linking to source material is the very means by which we are creating a vast, new, collective network of information and knowledge.
On the rare occasion when a writer wishes to reference but not drive traffic to a site she considers to be morally reprehensible (for example, a hate site), she should type out (but not link) the name or URL of the offending site and state the reasons for her decision. This will give motivated readers the information they need to find the site in order to make their own judgment. This strategy allows the writer to preserve her own transparency (and thus her integrity) while simultaneously declining to lend support to a cause she finds contemptible.

3. Publicly correct any misinformation.

If you find that you have linked to a story that was untrue, make a note of it and link to a more accurate report. If one of your own statements proves to be inaccurate, note your misstatement and the truth. Ideally, these corrections would appear in the most current version of your weblog and as an added note to the original entry. (Remember that search engines will pull up entries without regard to when they were posted; once an entry exists in your archives, it may continue to spread an untruth even if you corrected the information a few days later.) If you aren't willing to add a correction to previous entries, at least note it in a later post.
One clear method of denoting a correction is the one employed by Cory Doctorow, one of the contributors to the Boing Boing weblog. He strikes through any erroneous information and adds the corrected information immediately following. The reader can see at a glance what Bill Cory originally wrote and that he has updated the entry with information he feels to be more accurate. (Do it like this in HTML: The reader can see at a glance what <strike>Bill</strike> Cory originally wrote and that he has updated the entry with information he feels to be more accurate.)

4. Write each entry as if it could not be changed; add to, but do not rewrite or delete, any entry.

Post deliberately. If you invest each entry with intent, you will ensure your personal and professional integrity.
“ The network of shared knowledge we are building will never be more than a novelty unless we protect its integrity by creating permanent records of our publications. ”
Changing or deleting entries destroys the integrity of the network. The Web is designed to be connected; indeed, the weblog permalink is an invitation for others to link. Anyone who comments on or cites a document on the Web relies on that document (or entry) to remain unchanged. A prominent addendum is the preferred way to correct any information anywhere on the Web. If an addendum is impractical, as in the case of an essay that contains numerous inaccuracies, changes must be noted with the date and a brief description of the nature of the change.

If you think this is overly scrupulous, consider the case of the writer who points to an online document in support of an assertion. If this document changes or disappears — and especially if the change is not noted — her argument may be rendered nonsensical. Books do not change; journals are static. On paper, new versions are always denoted as such.
The network of shared knowledge we are building will never be more than a novelty unless we protect its integrity by creating permanent records of our publications. The network benefits when even entries that are rendered irrelevant by changing circumstance are left as a historical record. As an example: A weblogger complains about inaccuracies in an online article; the writer corrects those inaccuracies (and notes them!); the weblogger's entry is therefore meaningless — or is it? Deleting the entry somehow asserts that the whole incident simply didn't happen — but it did. The record is more accurate and history is better served if the weblogger notes beneath the original entry that the writer has made the corrections and the article is now, to the weblogger's knowledge, accurate.

History can be rewritten, but it cannot be undone. Changing or deleting words is possible on the Web, but possibility does not always make good policy. Think before you publish and stand behind what you write. If you later decide you were wrong about something, make a note of it and move on.
I make a point never to post anything I am not willing to stand behind even if I later disagree. I work to be thoughtful and accurate, no matter how angry or excited I am about a particular topic. If I change my opinion in a day or two, I just note the change. If I need to apologize for something I've said, I do so.

If you discover that you have posted erroneous information, you must note this publicly on your weblog. Deleting the offending entry will do nothing to correct the misinformation your readers have already absorbed. Taking the additional step of adding a correction to the original entry will ensure that Google broadcasts accurate information into the future.
The only exception to this rule is when you inadvertently reveal personal information about someone else. If you discover that you have violated a confidence or made an acquaintance uncomfortable by mentioning him, it is only fair to remove the offending entry altogether, but note that you have done so.

5. Disclose any conflict of interest.

Most webloggers are quite transparent about their jobs and professional interests. It is the computer programmer's expertise that gives her commentary special weight when she analyzes a magazine article about the merits of the latest operating system. Since weblog audiences are built on trust, it is to every weblogger's benefit to disclose any monetary (or other potentially conflicting) interests when appropriate. An entrepreneur may have special insight into the effect of a proposed Senate bill or a business merger; if she stands to benefit directly from the outcome of any event, she should note that in her comments. A weblogger, impressed with a service or product, should note that she holds stock in the company every time she promotes the service on her page. Even the weblogger who receives a CD for review should note that fact; her readers can decide for themselves whether her favorable review is based on her taste or on her desire to continue to receive free CDs.

Quickly note any potential conflict of interest and then say your piece; your readers will have all the information they need to assess your commentary.

6. Note questionable and biased sources.

When a serious article comes from a highly biased or questionable source, the weblogger has a responsibility to clearly note the nature of the site on which it was found. In their foraging, webloggers occasionally find interesting, well-written articles on sites that are maintained by highly biased organizations or by seemingly fanatical individuals. Readers need to know whether an article on the medical ramifications of first trimester abortion comes from a site that is pro-life, pro-choice, or strongly opposed to medical intervention of all kinds. A thoughtful summation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may be worth reading whether it is written by a member of the PLO or a Zionist — but readers have the right to be alerted to the source.

It is reasonable to expect that expert foragers have the knowledge and motivation to assess the nature of these sources; it is not reasonable to assume that all readers do. Readers depend on weblogs, to some extent, for guidance in navigating the Web. To present an article from a source that is a little nutty or has a strong agenda is fine; not to acknowledge the nature of that source is unethical, since readers don't have the information they need to fully evaluate the article's merits.

If you are afraid that your readers will discount the article entirely based on its context, consider why you are linking it at all. If you strongly feel the piece has merit, say why and let it stand on its own, but be clear about its source. Your readers may cease to trust you if they discover even once that you disguised — or didn't make clear — the source of an article they might have evaluated differently had they been given all the facts.

1 With regard to points 1 and 5, I am indebted to Dave Winer for his discussions on Scripting News about integrity with regard to weblogging. Though our thinking diverges greatly, his ideas were one springboard for my own thoughts on the matter.

Let the top of hierarchy know that they can't use technology to control
us, but that we are fully integrated with technology and it is ours.
Digitize the world!!! 
It's time to interface with technology and understand it. 
KNOW IT personally.
Get TECH. out of the establishment and into the streets.
Dive in CYBERSPACE where all feelings and physical realities can be
psycho-chemically simulated. 
DON'T BE AFRAID : EXPOSE YOUR CIRCUITRY. 
COME TO TERMS WITH TODAY'S MATERIALS.
The future will come whether you like it or not so be ready for it.
PAINTING HAS DIED AGAIN : stop using purely old materials like oil and
canvas.
It will not last in a cyber world.

By Christian As. Kirtchev



We are the ELECTRONIC MINDS, a group of free-minded rebels. Cyberpunks.
We live in Cyberspace, we are everywhere, we know no boundaries.
This is our manifest. The Cyberpunks' manifest.


I. Cyberpunk

1/ We are those, the Different. Technological rats, swimming in the ocean of information.
2/ We are the retiring, little kid at school, sitting at the last desk, in the corner of the class room. 3/ We are the teenager everybody considers strange 4/ We are the student hacking computer systems, exploring the depth of his reach. 5/ We are the grown-up in the park, sitting on a bench, laptop on his knees, programming the last virtual reality. 6/ Ours is the garage, stuffed with electronics. The soldering iron in the corner of the desk and the nearby disassembled radio- they are also ours. Ours is the cellar with computers, buzzing printers and beeping modems. 7/ We are those that see reality in a different way. Our point of view shows more than ordinary people can see. They see only what is outside, but we see what is inside. That's what we are - realists with the glasses of dreamers. 8/ We are those strange people, almost unknown to the neighborhood. People, indulged in their own thoughts, sitting day after day before the computer, ransacking the net for something. We are not often out of home, just from time to time, only to go to the nearby radio shack, or to the usual bar to meet some of the few friends we have, or to meet a client, or to the backstreet druggist... or just for a little walk. 9/ We do not have many friends, only a few with whom we go to parties. Everybody else we know we know on the net. Our real friends are there, on the other side of the line. We know them from our favorite IRC channel, from the News-Groups, from the systems we hang-around: 10/ We are those who don't give a shit about what people think about us, we don't care what we look like or what people talk about us in our absence. 11/ The majority of us likes to live in hiding, being unknown to everybody except those few we must inevitably contact with. 12/ Others love publicity, they love fame. They are all known in the underground world. Their names are often heard there.
But we are all united by one thing - we are Cyberpunks.

13/ Society does not understand us, we are ""weird"" and ""crazy"" people in the eyes of the ordinary people who live far from information and free ideas. Society denies our way of thinking - a society, living, thinking and breathing in one and only one way - a clichc. 14/ They deny us for we think like free people, and free thinking is forbidden. 15/ The Cyberpunk has outer appearance, he is no motion. Cyberpunks are people, starting from the ordinary and known to nobody person, to the artist-technomaniac, to the musician, playing electronic music, to the superficial scholar. 16/ The Cyberpunk is no literature genre anymore, not even an ordinary subculture. The Cyberpunk is a stand-alone new culture, offspring of the new age. A culture that unites our common interests and views. We are a unit. We are Cyberpunks.


II. Society

1/ The Society which surrounds us is clogged with concervacy pulling everything and everybody to itself, while it sinks slowly in the quicksands of time. 2/ However doggedly some refuse to believe it, it is obvious that we live in a sick society. The so called reforms which our governments so adeptly use to boast, are nothing else but a little step forward, when a whole jump can be done. 3/ People fear the new and unknown. They prefer the old, the known and checked truths. They are afraid of what the new can bring to them. They are afraid that they can lose what they have. 4/ Their fear is so strong that it has proclaimed the revolutional a foe and a the free idea - its weapon. That's their fault. 5/ People must leave this fear behind and go ahead. What's the sense to stick to the little you have now when you can have more tomorrow. Everything they must do is stretch their hands and feel for the new; give freedom to thoughts, ideas, to words: 6/ For centuries each generation has been brought up is a same pattern. Ideals is what everybody follows. Individuality is forgotten. People think in a same way, following the clichc drilled in them in childhood, the clichc-education for all children: And, when someone dares defy authority, he is punished and given as a bad example. ""Here is what happens to you when you express your own opinion and deny your teacher's one"". 7/ Our society is sick and need to be healed. The cure is a change in the system...


III. The System

1/ The System. Centuries-old, existing on principles that hang no more today. A System that has not changed much since the day of its birth. 2/ The System is wrong. 3/ The System must impose its truth upon us so that it can rule. The government needs us follow it blindly. For this reason we live in an informational eclipse. When people acquire information other that that from the government, they cannot distinguish the right from the wrong. So the lie becomes a truth - a truth, fundamental to everything else. Thus the leaders control with lies and the ordinary people have no notion of what is true and follow the government blindly, trusting it. 4/ We fight for freedom of information. We fight for freedom of speech and press. For the freedom to express our thoughts freely, without being persecuted by the system. 5/ Even in the most-developed and 'democratic' countries, the system imposes misinformation. Even in the countries that pretend to be the cradle of free speech. Misinformation is one of the system's main weapon. A weapon, they use very well. 6/ It is the Net that helps us spread the information freely. The Net, with no boundaries and information limit 7/ Ours is yours, yours is ours. 8/ Everyone can share information, no restrictions. 9/ Encrypting of informattion is our weapon. Thus the words of revolution can spread uninterrupted, and the government can only guess. 10/ The Net is our realm, in the Net we are Kings.11/ Laws. The world is changing, but the laws remain the same. The System is not changing, only a few details get redressed for the new time, but everything in the concept remains the same. 12/ We need new laws. Laws, fitting the times we live in, with the world that surrounds us. Not laws build on the basis of the past. Laws, build for today, laws, that will fit tomorrow. 13/ The laws that only refrain us. Laws that badly need revision.


IV. The vision

1/ Some people do not care much about what happens globally. They care about what happens around them, in their micro-universe. 2/ These people can only see a dark future, for they can only see the life they live now. 3/ Others show some concern about the global affairs. They are interested in everything,in the future in perspective, in what is going to happen globally. 4/ They have a more optimistic view. To them the future is cleaner and more beautiful, for they can see into it and they see a more mature man, a wiser world. 5/ We are in the middle. We are interested in what happens now, but what in what's gonna happen tomorow as well. 6/ We look in the net, and the net is growing wide and wider. 7/ Soon everything in this world will be swallowed by the net: from the military systems to the PC at home. 8/ But the net is a house of anarchy. 9/ It cannot be controlled and in this is its power. 10/ Every man will be dependent on the net. 11/ The whole information will be there, locked in the abysses of zeros and ones. 12/ Who controls the net, controls the information. 13/ We will live in a mixture of past and present. 14/ The bad come from the man, and the good comes from technology. 15/ The net will control the little man, and we will control the net. 16/ For is you do not control, you will be controlled. 17/ The Information is POWER!


V. Where are we?

1/ Where are we? 2/ We all live in a sick world, where hatred is a weapon, and freedom - a dream. 3/ The world grows so slowly. It is hard for a Cyberpunk to live in an underdeveloped world, looking the people around him, seeing how wrongly they develop. 4/ We go ahead, they pull us back again. Society suppressses us. Yes, it suppresses the freedom of thought. With its cruel education programs in schools and universities. They drill in the children their view of things and every attempt to express a different opinion is denied and punished. 5/ Our kids grow educated in this old and still unchanged system. A system that tolerates no freedom of thought and demands a strict obeyance to the reules... 6/ In what a worlds, how different from this, could we live now, if people were making jumps and not creeps. 7/ It is so hard to live in this world, Cyberpunk. 8/ It is as if time has stopped. 9/ We live on the right spot, but not in the right time. 10/ Everything is so ordinary, people are all the same, their deeds toos. As if society feels an urgent need to live back in time. 11/ Some, trying to find their own world, the world of a Cyberpunk, and finding it, build their own world. Build in their thoughts, it changes reality, lays over it and thus they live in a virtual world. The thought-up, build upon reality: 12/ Others simply get accustomed to the world as it is. They continue to live in it, although they dislike it. They have no other choice but the bare hope that the world will go out of its hollow and will go ahead.13/ What we are trying to do is change the situation. We are trying to adjust the present world to our needs and views. To use maximally what is fit and to ignore the trash. Where we can't, we just live in this world, like Cyberpunks, no matter how hard, when society fights us we fight back.14/ We build our worlds in Cyberspace. 15/ Among the zeros and ones, among the bits of information. 16/ We build our community. The community of Cyberpunks.


Unite!
Fight for your rights!


We are the ELECTRONIC MINDS, a group of free-minded rebels. Cyberpunks.
We live in Cyberspace, we are everywhere, we know no boundaries.
This is our manifest. The Cyberpunks' Manifest.

by Eric Hughes


Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.

If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has a memory of their interaction. Each party can speak about their own memory of this; how could anyone prevent it? One could pass laws against it, but the freedom of speech, even more than privacy, is fundamental to an open society; we seek not to restrict any speech at all. If many parties speak together in the same forum, each can speak to all the others and aggregate together knowledge about individuals and other parties. The power of electronic communications has enabled such group speech, and it will not go away merely because we might want it to.

Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary for that transaction. Since any information can be spoken of, we must ensure that we reveal as little as possible. In most cases personal identity is not salient. When I purchase a magazine at a store and hand cash to the clerk, there is no need to know who I am. When I ask my electronic mail provider to send and receive messages, my provider need not know to whom I am speaking or what I am saying or what others are saying to me; my provider only need know how to get the message there and how much I owe them in fees. When my identity is revealed by the underlying mechanism of the transaction, I have no privacy. I cannot here selectively reveal myself; I must always reveal myself.

Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system. An anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system. An anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.

Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography. If I say something, I want it heard only by those for whom I intend it. If the content of my speech is available to the world, I have no privacy. To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy, and to encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for privacy. Furthermore, to reveal one's identity with assurance when the default is anonymity requires the cryptographic signature.

We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence. It is to their advantage to speak of us, and we should expect that they will speak. To try to prevent their speech is to fight against the realities of information. Information does not just want to be free, it longs to be free. Information expands to fill the available storage space. Information is Rumor's younger, stronger cousin; Information is fleeter of foot, has more eyes, knows more, and understands less than Rumor.

We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. We must come together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions to take place. People have been defending their own privacy for centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret handshakes, and couriers. The technologies of the past did not allow for strong privacy, but electronic technologies do.

We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems. We are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money.

Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all to use, worldwide. We don't much care if you don't approve of the software we write. We know that software can't be destroyed and that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down.

Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is fundamentally a private act. The act of encryption, in fact, removes information from the public realm. Even laws against cryptography reach only so far as a nation's border and the arm of its violence. Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and with it the anonymous transactions systems that it makes possible.

For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract. People must come and together deploy these systems for the common good. Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of one's fellows in society. We the Cypherpunks seek your questions and your concerns and hope we may engage you so that we do not deceive ourselves. We will not, however, be moved out of our course because some may disagree with our goals.

The Cypherpunks are actively engaged in making the networks safer for privacy. Let us proceed together apace.

Onward.

1
[The content of the manifesto represents the view of the authors and does not claim to represent the views of UCLA, the UCLA Humanities, Division, and the Digital Humanities at UCLA.]


2
Digital humanities is not a unified field but an array of convergent practices that explore a universe in which print is no longer the exclusive or the normative medium in which knowledge is produced and/or disseminated.


3
Like all media revolutions, the first wave of the digital revolution looked backwards as it moved forward. It replicated a world where print was primary and visuality was secondary, while vastly accelerating search and retrieval. Now it must look forwards into an immediate future in which the medium specific features of the digital become its core.


4
The first wave was quantitative, mobilizing the vertiginous search and retrieval powers of the database. The second wave is qualitative, interpretive, experiential, even emotive. It immerses the digital toolkit within what represents the very core strength of the Humanities: complexity.


5
Interdisciplinarity/transdisciplinarity/multidisciplinarity are empty words unless they imply changes in language, practice, method, and output.


6
The digital is the realm of the open: open source, open resources, open doors. Anything that attempts to close this space should be recognized for what it is: the enemy.


7
Yes, there is something utopian at the core of digital humanities: The open, the unfixed, the contingent, the infinite, the expansive, the no place.


8
Copyright and IP standards must, accordingly, be freed from the stranglehold of Capital. Pirate and pervert Disney materials on such a massive scale that Disney will have to sue… your entire neighborhood, school, or country. Practice digital anarchy by creatively undermining copyright and mashing up media.


9
The multi-purposing and multiple channeling of humanistic knowledge: no channel excludes the other. This is an abundance based economy, not one based upon scarcity. It values the COPY more highly than ORIGINALS and restores to the word COPY its original meaning of abundance: COPIA = COPIOUSNESS = THE OVERFLOWING BOUNTY OF THE INFORMATION AGE.


10
Large-scale complexity: need for teamwork as new model for the production and reproduction of humanistic knowledge. Teams sometimes fail because they take risks. This is the heart of digital humanities: Risk-taking, collaboration, and experimentation.


11
Co-creation is one of the founding features of the digital turn in the human sciences, because of the greater complexity. But this collaborative turn doesn’t exclude … perhaps there is a space of hermetic works of the mad individual.


12
Among the highest aims of scholarship: entertainment; entertainment as scholarship: a scandal that is now no longer a scandal. To speak to an audience.


13
Process is the new god; not product. Anything that stands in the way of the perpetual mash-up and remix stands in the way of the digital revolution.


14
Dedefinition of the contours of the research community once enclosed by university walls. The field of knowledge and expertise far exceeds these confines. There is no containing it within these walls. The challenge: to construct models of knowledge creation/sharing that confront this increasingly distributed reality.


15
Wiki-nomics is the new social, cultural, and economic reality. Technologies and content are mass produced, mass authored, and mass administered. Social media produce culture.


16
Big Humanities: whereas the revolution of the post-WWII era has consisted in the proliferation of every smaller and more rigorous areas of expertise and subexpertise, and the consequent emergence of private languages, the Digital humanities revolution is about integration: the building of bigger pictures out of the tesserae of expert knowledge. It is not about the emergence of a new general culture, Renaissance humanism/humanities, or universal literacy, but, on the contrary, promotes collaboration across domains of expertise.


17
At the edges of digital humanities, entertainment meets the highest standards of scholarship in ways that forge a new trans-university audience for humanistic knowledge.


18
Beware of the false fellow travelers: they will wave the banners of change with continuity on their agenda.


19
Beware of the great diminishers: they will reduce anything in digital humanities and preface our work with ""just"" (it's just a tool; it's just an archive; it's just pedagogy). They have never built software, parsed code, created a database, or designed a user interface. They just write articles and books.


20
Digital humanities promote a flattening of the relationship between masters and disciples. A dedefinition of the roles of professor and student, expert and non-expert.

21
Digital humanities represents the woven together practice of research: a triangulation of arts practice, commentary/critique, and outreach, merging scholarly inquiry, pedagogy, publication and practice.


22
REMARKS ON THE FINITUDE OF DISCIPLINES


23
Many humanities disciplines were founded on and through the medium of print (the study of literature, history; translation); the rest valorize the printed word for the generation and dissemination of knowledge of their field. What does it mean to study ""literature"" or ""history"" when print is no longer the normative medium in which literary or historical artifacts are produced, let alone analyzed? What does it mean, more generally, for humanistic knowledge?


24
Digital Humanities is the last blow. In the 70s and 80s, women's studies, LGBTQ studies, ethnic studies, and cultural studies opened up the humanities to address issues of social, political, and cultural disenfranchisement and possibilities for re-enfranchisement. The Humanities was no longer the domain of the proverbial ""old white man."" Now, digital humanities deconstructs the very materiality, methods, and media of humanistic inquiry and practices. But we must continue to ask: Where did humanities disciplines come from, in response to what kind of needs, with what sort of explanatory power? How did its practices, truth-making strategies, knowledge products, media forms, and ways of evaluating utterances get naturalized??


25
The Humanities are contingent formations that have become stabilized and made culturally redundant at the university: As if we have always had The Department of X, which has produced knowledge about X, and therefore we can’t possibly imagine anything otherwise. Let X = literature departments (German, English, Spanish, Slavic, etc), Art History, Musicology, History, Philosophy, Classics, etc. Traditional Humanities is balkanized by nation, language, method, and media. Digital Humanities is about convergence: Not only between humanities disciplines and media forms, but also between the arts, sciences, and technologies.


26
How about a thought exercise in which we imagine different constellations (not just disciplinary constellations, but also other configurations of producing knowledge that can be team- and project-based, collaborative, open-ended, globally-oriented, engaging for new audiences and institutions).


27
Here are some new departments for the Humanities Division:


28
Department of Print Media Studies: Replacing literature departments, the purpose of this department is to study the materiality of texts, constructions of authorship, linguistic forms, the history of the book and book publication, antecedents to and descendents of print, as well as the relationships and tensions between print culture and digital culture.
Department of Discourse Analyses: The purpose of this department is to study the history of the triangulation of knowledge/discourse/power, paying particular attention to discursive structures, knowledge making, and the specific media forms in which knowledge is produced, disseminated, encountered, and valued.
Department of Comparative Media Studies: The purpose of this department is to study sonic, visual, tactile, and immersive media through a comparative framework. This department replaces the division of humanities departments by media form (departments of art history, musicology, film, etc).
Department of Digital Cultural Mapping: The purpose of this department is to examine the junctions between space/time, information, and culture. It brings geographic analyses together with historical methods, visual analysis, and the presentation of knowledge. It also examines the cultural and social impact of digital mapping technologies and the significance of these mapping technologies for understanding cultural phenomena.
Department of Cultural Analytics: The purpose of this department is to bring quantitative analyses from the math and sciences together with large-scale, complex social and cultural datasets.
We encourage you to come up with your own departments!


29
We must ask: Why do disciplines/departments in the humanities (vs. the sciences) not die? Why do we try to resuscitate and sustain disciplines? Here are some reasons (there are more): Cognitive Conservatism, Institutional Inertia, the fear of risk-taking, the tenure and promotion system which encourages repetition of truthful utterances within a discipline rather than innovation and risk taking, the dogged determination to ""replace"" faculty with the same...

30
Can we imagine more flexible, nimble, contingent disciplinary formations, in which faculty and students work on ""knowledge problematics"" not in rigid disciplines and departments, in which knowledge is produced and disseminated in ways that are multivalent, truly interdisciplinary, and conspicuously cognizant of their contingency?

Context

We, professionals or observers of the digital humanities (humanités numériques) came together in Paris for THATCamp on May 18th and 19th, 2010.

Over the course of these two days, we discussed, exchanged, and collectively reflected upon what the digital humanities are, and tried to imagine and invent what they could become.

At the close of the camp – which represents but a first step – we propose to the research communities, and to all those involved in the creation, publication, valorization or preservation of knowledge, a manifesto for the digital humanities.

I. Definition

1. Society’s digital turn changes and calls into question the conditions of knowledge production and distribution.

2. For us, the digital humanities concern the totality of the social sciences and humanities. The digital humanities are not tabula rasa. On the contrary, they rely on all the paradigms, savoir-faire and knowledge specific to these disciplines, while mobilizing the tools and unique perspectives enabled by digital technology.

3. The digital humanities designate a “transdiscipline”, embodying all the methods, systems and heuristic perspectives linked to the digital within the fields of humanities and the social sciences.

II. Situation

4. We observe:

- that experiments in the digital domain of the social sciences and humanities have multiplied in the last half century. What have emerged most recently are centers for digital humanities – which at the moment are themselves only protoypes or areas of application specific to the approach of digital humanities;

- that computational and digital approaches have greater technical, and therefore economic, research constraints; that these constraints provide an opportunity to foster collaborative work;

- that while a certain number of proven methods exist, they are not equally known or shared;

- that there are many communities deriving from shared interests in practices, tools, and various interdisciplinary goals – encoding textual sources, geographic information systems, lexicometry, digitization of cultural, scientific and technical heritage, web cartography, datamining, 3D, oral archives, digital arts and hypermedia literatures, etc. – and that these communities are converging to form the field of digital humanities.

III. Declaration

5. We, professionals of the digital humanities, are building a community of practice that is solidary, open, welcoming and freely accessible.

6. We are a community without borders. We are a multilingual and multidisciplinary community.

7. Our objectives are the advancement of knowledge, the improvement of research quality in our disciplines, the enrichment of knowledge and of collective patrimony, in the academic sphere and beyond it.

8. We call for the integration of digital culture in the definition of the general culture of the twenty-first century.

IV. Guidelines

9. We call for open access to data and metadata, which must be documented and interoperable, both technically and conceptually.

10. We support the dissemination, exchange and free modification of methods, code, formats and research findings.

11. We call for the integration of digital humanities education within social science and humanities curricula. We also wish to see the creation of diplomas specific to the digital humanities, and the development of dedicated professional education. Finally, we want such expertise to be considered in recruitment and career development.

12. We commit to building a collective expertise based upon a common vocabulary, a collective expertise proceeding from the work of all the actors involved. This collective expertise is to become a common good. It is a scientific opportunity, but also an opportunity for professional insertion in all sectors.

13. We want to help define and propagate best practices, corresponding to needs identified within or across disciplines, which should derive and evolve from debate and consensus within the communities concerned. The fundamental openness of the digital humanities nevertheless assures a pragmatic approach to protocols and visions, which maintains the right to coexistence of different and competing methods, to the benefit of both thought and practice.

14. We call for the creation of scalable digital infrastructures responding to real needs. These digital infrastructures will be built iteratively, based upon methods and approaches that prove successful in research communities.

Digital Spectrology is that dirty work of a cultural theorist who wants to understand how power works in the age of circuitry. Power circulates not only in human spaces of cities, organic bodies or just plain things and objects. Increasingly, our archaeologies of the contemporary need to turn inside the machine, in order to illuminate what is the condition of existence of how we think, see, hear, remember and hallucinate in the age of software. This includes things discarded, abandoned, obsolete as much as the obscure object of desire still worthy of daylight. As such, digital archaeology deals with spectres too; but these ghosts are not only hallucinations of afterlife reached through the media of mediums, or telegraphics, signals from Mars, the screen as a window to the otherwordly; but in the electromagnetic sphere, dynamics of software, ubiquitous computing, clouds so transparent we are mistaken to think of them as soft. Media Archaeology shares a temporality of the dead and zombies with Hauntology. Dead media is never actually dead. So what is the method of a media archaeologist of technological ghosts? She opens up the hood, looks inside, figures out what are the processual technics of our politics and aesthetics: The Aesthetico-Technical.

bruces@well.com

Ever notice how many books there are about the Internet these days? About 13,493 so far, right? And how about ""multimedia?"" There are 8,784 books on this topic, even though no one has ever successfully defined the term. CD-ROM -- is there a single marketable topic left that hasn't been shovelwared into the vast digital mire that is CD-ROM? And how about the ""Information Superhighway"" and ""Virtual Reality""? Every magazine on the planet has done awestruck vaporware cover stories on these two consensus-hallucinations.

Our culture is experiencing a profound radiation of new species of media. The centralized, dinosaurian one- to-many media that roared and trampled through the 20th century are poorly adapted to the postmodern technological environment. The new media environment is aswarm with lumbering toothy digital mammals. It's all lynxes here, and gophers there, plus big fat venomous webcrawlers, appearing in Pleistocene profusion.

This is all well and good, and it's lovely that so many people are paying attention to this. Nothing gives me greater pleasure as a professional garage futurist than to ponder some weird new mutant medium and wonder how this squawking little monster is going to wriggle its way into the interstices between human beings. Still, there's a difference between this pleasurable contemplation of the technological sublime and an actual coherent understanding of the life and death of media. We have no idea in hell what we are doing to ourselves with these new media technologies, and no consistent way even to discuss the subject. Something constructive ought to be done about this situation.

I can't do much about it, personally, because I'm booked up to the eyeballs until the end of the millennium. So is my good friend Richard Kadrey, author of the COVERT CULTURE SOURCEBOOK. Both Kadrey and myself, however, recently came to a joint understanding that what we'd really like to see at this cultural conjunction is an entirely new kind of book on media. A media book of the dead.

Plenty of wild wired promises are already being made for all the infant media. What we need is a somber, thoughtful, thorough, hype-free, even lugubrious book that honors the dead and resuscitates the spiritual ancestors of today's mediated frenzy. A book to give its readership a deeper, paleontological perspective right in the dizzy midst of the digital revolution. We need a book about the failures of media, the collapses of media, the supercessions of media, the strangulations of media, a book detailing all the freakish and hideous media mistakes that we should know enough now not to repeat, a book about media that have died on the barbed wire of technological advance, media that didn't make it, martyred media, dead media. THE HANDBOOK OF DEAD MEDIA. A naturalist's field guide for the communications paleontologist.

Neither Richard Kadrey nor myself are currently in any position to write this proposed handbook. However, we both feel that our culture truly requires this book: this rich, witty, insightful, profusely illustrated, perfectbound, acid-free-paper coffee-table book, which is to be brought out, theoretically, eventually, by some really with-it, cutting-edge early-21st century publisher. The kind of book that will appear in seventeen different sections of your local chainstore: Political Affairs, Postmodern Theory, Computer Science, Popular Mechanics, Design Studies, the coffeetable artbook section, the remainder table -- you know, whatever.

It's a rather rare phenomenon for an established medium to die. If media make it past their Golden Vaporware stage, they usually expand wildly in their early days and then shrink back to some protective niche as they are challenged by later and more highly evolved competitors. Radio didn't kill newspapers, TV didn't kill radio or movies, video and cable didn't kill broadcast network TV; they just all jostled around seeking a more perfect app.

But some media do, in fact, perish. Such as: the phenakistoscope. The teleharmonium. The Edison wax cylinder. The stereopticon. The Panorama. Early 20th century electric searchlight spectacles. Morton Heilig's early virtual reality. Telefon Hirmondo. The various species of magic lantern. The pneumatic transfer tubes that once riddled the underground of Chicago. Was the Antikythera Device a medium? How about the Big Character Poster Democracy Wall in Peking in the early 80s?

Never heard of any of these? Well, that's the problem. Both Kadrey and I happen to be vague aficionados of this field of study, and yet we both suspect that there must be hundreds of dead media, known to few if any. It would take the combined and formidable scholarly talents of, say, Carolyn ""When Old Technologies Were New"" Marvin and Ricky ""Learned Pigs and Fireproof Women"" Jay to do this ambitious project genuine justice. Though we haven't asked, we kinda suspect that these two distinguished scholars are even busier than me and Kadrey, who, after all, are just science fiction writers who spend most of our time watching Chinese videos, reading fanzines and making up weird crap.

However. We do have one, possibly crucial, advantage. We have Internet access. If we can somehow convince the current digital media community-at-large that DEAD MEDIA is a worthwhile project, we believe that we may be able to compile a useful public-access net archive on this subject. We plan to begin with the DEAD MEDIA World Wide Web Page, on a site to-be-announced. Move on, perhaps, to alt.dead.media. Compile the Dead Media FAQ. We hope to exploit the considerable strengths of today's cutting-edge media to create a general public- domain homage to the media pioneers of the past.

Here's the deal. Kadrey and I are going to start pooling our notes. We're gonna make those notes freely available to anybody on the Net. If we can get enough net.parties to express interest and pitch in reports, stories, and documentation about dead media, we're willing to take on the hideous burdens of editing and system administration -- no small deal when it comes to this supposedly ""free"" information.

We both know that authors are supposed to jealously guard really swell ideas like this, but we strongly feel that that just ain't the way to do a project of this sort. A project of this sort is a spiritual quest and an act in the general community interest. Our net heritage belongs to all netkind. If you yourself want to exploit these notes to write the DEAD MEDIA HANDBOOK -- sure, it's our ""idea,"" our ""intellectual property,"" but hey, we're cyberpunks, we write for magazines like BOING BOING, we can't be bothered with that crap in this situation. Write the book. Use our notes and everybody's else's. We won't sue you, we promise. Do it. Knock yourself out.

I'll go farther, ladies and gentlemen. To prove the profound commercial potential of this tilt at the windmill, I'll personally offer a CRISP FIFTY-DOLLAR BILL for the first guy, gal, or combination thereof to write and publish THE DEAD MEDIA HANDBOOK. You can even have the title if you want it. Just keep in mind that me and Kadrey (or any combination thereof) reserve the right to do a book of our own on the same topic if you fail to sufficiently scratch our itch. The prospect of ""competition"" frightens us not at all. It never has, frankly. If there's room for 19,785 ""Guide to the Internet"" books, there has got to be room for a few useful tomes on dead media.

Think of it this way. How long will it be before the much-touted World Wide Web interface is itself a dead medium? And what will become of all those billions of thoughts, words, images and expressions poured onto the Internet? Won't they vanish just like the vile lacquered smoke from a burning pile of junked Victrolas? As a net.person, doesn't this stark realization fill you with a certain deep misgiving, a peculiarly postmodern remorse, an almost Heian Japanese sense of the pathos of lost things? If it doesn't, why doesn't it? It ought to.

Speaking of dead media and mono no aware -- what about those little poems that Lady Murasaki used to write and stick inside cleft sticks? To be carried by foot- messager to the bamboo-shrouded estate of some lucky admirer after a night's erotic tryst? That was a medium. That medium was very alive once, a mainstay of one of the most artistically advanced cultures on earth. And isn't it dead? What are we doing today that is the functional equivalent of the cleft sticks of Murasaki Shikibu, the world's first novelist? If we ignore her historical experience, how will we learn from our own?

Listen to the following, all you digital hipsters. This is Jaqueline Goddard speaking in January 1995. Jacqueline was born in 1911, and she was one of the 20th century's great icons of bohemian femininity. Man Ray photographed her in Paris in 1930, and if we can manage it without being sued by the Juliet Man Ray Trust, we're gonna put brother Man Ray's knock-you-down-and-stomp-you- gorgeous image of Jacqueline up on our vaporware Website someday. She may be the patron saint of this effort.

Jacqueline testifies: ""After a day of work, the artists wanted to get away from their studios, and get away from what they were creating. They all met in the cafes to argue about this and that, to discuss their work, politics and philosophy.... We went to the bar of La Coupole. Bob, the barman, was a terrible nice chap... As there was no telephone in those days everybody used him to leave messages. At the Dome we also had a little place behind the door for messages. The telephone was the death of Montparnasse.""

""The telephone was the death of Montparnasse."" Mull that Surrealist testimony over a little while, all you cafe-society modemites. Jacqueline may not grok TCP/IP, but she has been there and done that. I haven't stopped thinking about that remark since I first read it. For whom does the telephone bell toll? It tolls for me and thee -- sooner or later.

Can you help us? We wish you would, and think you ought to.

We don't have choice. This decision is already made, or determined by the contemporary technological condition.

§1. Archive

We are archivists, since we have to be. We don't have choice. This decision is already made, or determined by the contemporary technological condition. The ubiquity of information in digital, calculable forms has created a new situation of work and exploitation, we entered an endless process of data production, and then we also enter an endless black hole of data navigation. The internet of data is a huge archive of data and at the same time a enormous black hole that sucks all productivities. Google is the best exemplification of this double: on the one hand, we are contributing data by using the Google tools, emails, blogs, Google+, Hangout, etc; on the other hand, Google gives us searching and managing tools to survive in this milieu. Worse still, Facebook shows another face, a huge archive of data without navigability, the only navigation one can do is to search for your friend, otherwise you need to stroll down the page to find out what you have written years ago.

Under such situation, we must recognize that one of the main economical and political questions concerning the digital is the one of archives. What has happened to the concept of archive after the digital turn? What kind of power structure is present to us in this new setting? Archives for Foucault are traces of enunciations by which one can reconstruct the game of rules (le jeu des régles), that in turn reveal the power structure of its milieu. Archives in this sense are reservoirs of discourses that make possible an archeology of knowledge. In order word, archives are sources of deduction for archeologists. The will of archive further makes archives as a manifestation of power. This will expands in the modern time and set up a direct relation between institutes and archives. Each institution has its archive, has its history of discourses. In order to maintain its status quo of discourses, it needs to give its archive a proper name. As Foucault observes the expansion of museums and libraries in modern time, that attempts “to enclose in one place all times, all epochs, all forms, all tastes”1. An archive is also a symbol of authenticity and authority. This project of the moderns confronts the biggest challenge in the digital age. On the one hand, public institutions adopting digital strategies also have to develop new form of interaction between archive and audiences, so to speak they are forced to open their archives; on the other hand, within an institutional framework, they continue keeping their archive in a centralized way (even the Michel Foucault Archive) in order to consolidate the status of these institution. Though today when these institutions implement “open polices” or alas crowdsourcing, it is still a strategy of crowd sourcing under the name of humanities or digital humanities to serve its central archives.

In this respect, Google is technically moving far ahead of these organisations, Google book, Goolge Museums are efforts to re-appropriate humanities through digitisation and crowd sourcing. Google doesn't only provide services with higher qualities and higher speed, but also goes beyond the relation between archives and human subjects. Google's archives exhibit an important distinction from that of Foucault's. It is that power is posing its forces directly on archives to achieve control, that is to say archives become a mechanism of control and social actions, instead of being traces of power2. Now we have to face a new game of rules that operates on more and more automatic and algorithmic level. Metadata produced by users become materials of induction, to generate patterns for prediction, rules, protocols of control. Archive stretches from discourses to gestures. It seems to me very clear, today in order to response to this political and economical dimensions of the web, we have to politicize the question of archive. The key seems to be personal archives. It is not simply from a technical consideration that we can then mitigate controls from the service providers or to keep privacy, but rather to rethink our relation with archives and to create another technological/digital culture. In order to do so, I propose to reflect on the following questions: What are we archiving and for what are we archiving? what does it mean to be an archivist?

§2. Care

We have been archivists from the moment we start owning things, toys, books, postcards, letters, we have our own way of organizing them, cataloging them. But it is only by now that we are confronting a situation, that we are not able to archive them, either possessing them or indexing them by ourselves. There are different levels of inabilities here: web services becomes more and more distributed, while data portability is still a problem; cloud computing is moving things from your hard-disk to someone else's server; indexation tools and personal libraries softwares are still underdeveloped, etc. These are not teddy bears, barbies, but digital objects (teddy bear and barbie dolls can be also digital). It is exactly this inability of archiving, created by the technological condition, opens up a new battlefield for search engines, social networks, cloud computing etc. But what are these objects and why do we have to re-conceptualize them seriously? In order to grasp the particular question of digital objects, we need to look at the particular evolution of the web, especially the decisive movement from Ted Nelson's vision of the web and Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web.

Ted Nelson's vision of the web was very much inspired by literature, it concerns indexation, by which one can jump from one link to another. For Nelson, the ultimate goal of the web was to create a micropayment system for authors. The invention of the web by Tim Berners-Lee and the recent use of ontologies to formalize data in machine-readable format, is not longer one that concerns hyper-link economy, but according to me a new economy of objects. It would be too complicated to argue the meaning of semantic of Semantic Web proposed by Berners-Lee, but it is clear that formalisation gives objects not only identity but also mobilities. It is only in such vision of Tim Berners-Lee we saw the continuation of the care of librarians, the emergence of a new type of object-hood defined by structuring metadata and a new type of care to come (HTML → XML → Web Ontologies). One of the examples that best demonstrate this is the enormous impact brought by human-machine readable web ontologies to library science. XML based Dublin Core directly confronted the conventional practice of MARC (MAchine-Readable Cataloging)3. “MARC must die” this was the slogan resonated among library technicians since early 2000s, you can find a specific website created by digital librarians dedicated to it. It is clear that the early development of metadata scheme for cataloging such as MARC hadn't taken the relationship between librarians and digital objects seriously. Technicians have to deal with abstract symbols which only machines can read, they are condemned to be assistants to machines

It is also within this conceptualisation of object, we can go back to the question of care that centres in the relationship between librarians and books. I take the word care very much from Martin Heidegger's Sorge. Care is the temporal structure by which we can understand our existence, this theme lies at the heart of Heidegger's Sein und Zeit. Care is not only, as we say in our daily life “taking care of something”, but also a temporal structure that create a consistent milieu for ourselves. Heidegger further develop the concept Besorgen to describe the concernful mode of being with tools, and Fürsorgen to describe two positive mode of care4. The political implication of Besorgen is that today our everyday life dealing with archives, for example searching on Goolge, updating Facebook, or other activities of crowd sourcing, are naturalized as habitude, as something unquestionable.

In contrary, Fürsorgen is at the same time worries of not being able to be there and affirmation that one can have of oneself. If we are allow to say so, one is passive, like affections, emotions; the other is active, anticipations and preparation for the future. What is crucial in Fürsorgen is act to “look back”. The late Foucault's concern of care resonates with the change in the perception of power of discourse to the self- development and practice of discourses. When Foucault wrote le souci de soi (care of the self), he means the practice of care, one occupies oneself, as Heidegger's nachsichtand zurücksicht both worries and affirmations. Foucault uses the example of the figure Socrates, who keeps on asking young people on the street “are you occupying yourself” even in face of his death. This practice of care is like librarians are able to take care of books, wiping away dusts on the cover, putting them on the right places, relating books to different themes, by taking these objects they create an associate milieu for objects and themselves. Of course not all librarians are like this, but this librarian metaphor emphasize links between objects and archives5. In contrast, the deprivation of care is one that systematically destroy these care structures by alienating the relation between objects and individuals. For example, users are seen merely as producers of data and those who can contribute to different sorts of crowd sourcing. At heart of the question of archive is the question of care, and I think today in order to care, one must think of archive, the exteriorisation of our memories, gestures, speeches, movements. Search engines, social networks, what one can call info-capitalism operates in the direction to transform care into something efficient and computable. By the end, we are no longer be able to organize these traces, but leave them on the cloud to be taken care by others.

§3. technics

What an archivist needs is not only his or her love of objects, but also skills or technics of care. Care like power, is not substance, but relations that is modified according to its material conditions. The technics of care and the technologies of care coincide in the context of archives. While this technological culture of archiving is not yet there, we must bring it back to the table. I want to associate this question with the French philosopher Gilbert Simondon, not only because Simondon proposed to take care of technical objects (that would be digital objects in our case), but, also, Simondon envisaged a technological culture as a possible solution to the question of alienation specifically, and the opposition between culture and technology in general. This imagination of technological culture was projected through the encyclopedianism of the Enlightenment. Simondon saw the emergence of encyclopedia as the first time in history that technics such as making glass, porcelains, weaving are presented to the public. Lets recall that one of the goals of the encyclopaedia is to ‘publish all the secrets of manufacturing’. In the 17 folio letter press volumes of the encyclopaedia, about 2,900 plates in 11 folio volumes were devoted to technology.

But the paradox concerning technological development, is that the more advance technologies become, the further we may distance ourselves from it. There are two problematics associated with it: firstly machine became abstract knowledge, what presents to the workers is an interface of control, the know-how is reduced to pressing a button, feeding machine with raw materials; secondly the mechanisation of all artisan skills, create a tendency of diskilling among workers, since automation replaces man's position as a technical individual. Industrialisation amplifies this effect. On one hand, the concretization of technical objects as technical individuals joins hand in hand with abstractions of labour and knowledges, a button or a control panel hided away large amount of practical knowledge and social relations. On the other hand, the exchange between labour and capital bring labours in the the endless circle of capital reproduction. This is what Simondon understands as proletarianisation and alienation through his reading of Marx, that somehow bypasses the question of properties. Be careful here, I am not suggesting that one should avoid abstraction and reduction; not at all, abstraction and reductions are necessary in many aspects, but the question is rather what kind of reductions and abstractions: one that favours individuation or one that produces disindividuation. For example, one can drive a car by knowing its speed, its limit, and one who dives by only knowing pressing which button, in both case we are dealing with different kind of abstractions. Today, Google and Facebook are doing the latter, we are used to press buttons, satisfy ourselves with the speed and convenience, without really understanding the problematics behind interfaces and its crowdsourcing algorithms.

Simondon argues against automation, for him automation is the lowest level of perfection of technical objects. Simondon proposes to take into account of the “margin of indetermination” in the invention of machine. It means the machine of higher level shouldn't be perfectly automatic, but needs to integrate human being in the technical ensemble as one that operates it, one that lives with it. This cannot be understood simply that human beings are users, instead they must restore their position as technical individuals. For Simondon it makes no sense to return to the craftsmanship as negation of industrialisation. According to his analysis, “human individuality finds itself more and more disengaged from the technical function by the construction of technical individual – but it creates actually a malaise, because human, always searching to be technical individual, no longer has a stable place next to machine: he becomes servant of machine or organisers of technical ensemble6”. The question is no longer one that savages machines and factories, but to invent a new conception of technical knowledge that reconstitute the culture of machine that is driven by capital and marketing. This is what Simondon calls a technological humanism, which “ aims at the most serious aspect of alienation that a civilisation behaves or produces”, so “each epoch should discover its humanism, and orienting it towards the principle danger of alienation”7. Simondon observes that work is only a phase of technicity, instead that technicity is part of work8. In our context, the problem of crowdsourcing as work is that the users don't know what they are contributing for, while they are virtually working through searching, typing status update. While this relationship between technicity and work, lays the possibility of overcoming the limitation of works by retrieving the potential of technicity.

Under these theoretical interpretation, the archivist manifesto is a proposal to regain the knowledge and skills of organising data and digital objects; only with the technology, can we take about the technics of care, that is also a humanism called by its technical reality. In summary, what I tried to do above is to re-conceptualize archives and archivists after the web, and propose to take this possibility to re-appropriate archives, by reflecting on the question of industrialisation of archives vis-à-vis the question of care, and the development of archival tools embeds a large extent of diskilling. The current discussions on search, open access, archives, preservation of information and digital objects, often hide away the politics of individuals under the disguise of “users”. Users to technological capitalism, are consumers to consumerist capitalism. Archivist manifesto is a call for the reinsertion of knowledge and skills for developing personal archives, that on one hand, reinstall the culture of care and a technological culture; on the other hand, develop an infrastructure that allows sharing of information on individual level and bypasses marketing tools such as search engines and commercial social networks. The following points briefly summarise three practices toward the archive culture:

on the technological side, one should become archivist instead of users, and manage one's own digital objects and data, in order to create personal archives; software developers should pay attention to the development of softwares for personal archives of digital objects. This includes indexation, annotation of digital objects and the portability of data and metadata from one individual archive to another archive or another system; these metadata and annotation can be used for search use.

opening up institutional archives and allows self-archiving, meaning archivists can download these digital objects. Institutional archives can still keep their own objects in a single place, but if users can download, share and annotate their own collections, and then contribute their metadata to institutional archives, this will significantly vitalize archives and move further from the ambition of the moderns described by Foucault (e.g. decentralized archive).

individual archives can share with each other. This may recall us of the early idea of Napster, an idea based on P2P sharing. But it is not exactly the same, since in the framework I proposed, at centre is not the question of exchange of good, but rather of care, of preserving and giving, to get away from the crowdsourcing logic and most importantly to imagine a technological humanism, as was once proposed by Gilbert Simondon.

1 The idea of accumulating everything, of establishing a sort of general archive, the will to enclose in one place all times, all epochs, all forms, all tastes, the idea of constituting a place of all times that is itself outside of time and inaccessible to its ravages, the project of organizing in this way a sort of perpetual and indefinite accumulation of time in an immobile place, this whole idea belongs to our modernity.

The first decade of the 21st century, the so-called ‘naughties’, has brought profound changes to the technological foundations of the media landscape. The key buzzwords are networks, the Internet and social media. In the second decade, people will not search for new technologies allowing for even easier, faster and low-priced content production. Rather, appropriate reactions to this media revolution are to be developed and integrated politically, culturally and socially. The concept “Slow”, as in “Slow Food” and not as in “Slow Down”, is a key for this. Like “Slow Food”, Slow Media are not about fast consumption but about choosing the ingredients mindfully and preparing them in a concentrated manner. Slow Media are welcoming and hospitable. They like to share.

1. Slow Media are a contribution to sustainability. Sustainability relates to the raw materials, processes and working conditions, which are the basis for media production. Exploitation and low-wage sectors as well as the unconditional commercialization of user data will not result in sustainable media. At the same time, the term refers to the sustainable consumption of Slow Media.

2. Slow media promote Monotasking. Slow Media cannot be consumed casually, but provoke the full concentration of their users. As with the production of a good meal, which demands the full attention of all senses by the cook and his guests, Slow Media can only be consumed with pleasure in focused alertness.

3. Slow Media aim at perfection. Slow Media do not necessarily represent new developments on the market. More important is the continuous improvement of reliable user interfaces that are robust, accessible and perfectly tailored to the media usage habits of the people.

4. Slow Media make quality palpable. Slow Media measure themselves in production, appearance and content against high standards of quality and stand out from their fast-paced and short-lived counterparts – by some premium interface or by an aesthetically inspiring design.

5. Slow Media advance Prosumers, i.e. people who actively define what and how they want to consume and produce. In Slow Media, the active Prosumer, inspired by his media usage to develop new ideas and take action, replaces the passive consumer. This may be shown by marginals in a book or animated discussion about a record with friends. Slow Media inspire, continuously affect the users’ thoughts and actions and are still perceptible years later.

6. Slow Media are discursive and dialogic. They long for a counterpart with whom they may come in contact. The choice of the target media is secondary. In Slow Media, listening is as important as speaking. Hence ‘Slow’ means to be mindful and approachable and to be able to regard and to question one’s own position from a different angle.

7. Slow Media are Social Media. Vibrant communities or tribes constitute around Slow Media. This, for instance, may be a living author exchanging thoughts with his readers or a community interpreting a late musician’s work. Thus Slow Media propagate diversity and respect cultural and distinctive local features.

8. Slow Media respect their users. Slow Media approach their users in a self-conscious and amicable way and have a good idea about the complexity or irony their users can handle. Slow Media neither look down on their users nor approach them in a submissive way.

9. Slow Media are distributed via recommendations not advertising: the success of Slow Media is not based on an overwhelming advertising pressure on all channels but on recommendation from friends, colleagues or family. A book given as a present five times to best friends is a good example.

10. Slow Media are timeless: Slow Media are long-lived and appear fresh even after years or decades. They do not lose their quality over time but at best get some patina that can even enhance their value.

11. Slow Media are auratic: Slow Media emanate a special aura. They generate a feeling that the particular medium belongs to just that moment of the user’s life. Despite the fact that they are produced industrially or are partially based on industrial means of production, they are suggestive of being unique and point beyond themselves.

12. Slow Media are progressive not reactionary: Slow Media rely on their technological achievements and the network society’s way of life. It is because of the acceleration of multiple areas of life, that islands of deliberate slowness are made possible and essential for survival. Slow Media are not a contradiction to the speed and simultaneousness of Twitter, Blogs or Social Networks but are an attitude and a way of making use of them.

13. Slow Media focus on quality both in production and in reception of media content: Craftsmanship in cultural studies such as source criticism, classification and evaluation of sources of information are gaining importance with the increasing availability of information.

14. Slow Media ask for confidence and take their time to be credible. Behind Slow Media are real people. And you can feel that.

Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.

We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.

Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions.

You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your impositions.

You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social Contract . This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours. Our world is different.

Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.

We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.

We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.

Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here.

Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge . Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.

In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams must now be born anew in us.

You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.

In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media.

Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.

These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.

We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.

Excerpt from a newspaper of the future: ""A man was checked yesterday at the Franco-Italian border. The inspection of his computer revealed that it harbored pirated products, mainly Adobe software and music of the Beatles. The man was arrested on the spot. ""

Whether it's a poem or a drug, or a software disk, a film or a book, anything that is popular and profitable should the majority of its value economic handling of crowds. No one asked to get a Coca-Cola logo, or to know the chorus of ""Like a Virgin"". Education, Media and Propaganda we are swallowed by force, hammering at will or by speculating on our thirst, our hunger, our need for communication and entertainment, and above all our loneliness and our malaise. In the age of Internet, which can be copied can be shared. In terms of content, one can distribute, to everyone at the same time. 

In light of this finding, a new class emerges. It is not a working class but a class of producers. In essence, these producers are pirates and hackers; they reuse the images, sounds, and ideas of the world. They create some, but mostly they borrow from others. 

The information is now part of our body, it is literally ""installed"" in our brain, and we can not delete on request. That is why we have the right to possess the information we projected, we are right to be masters of ourselves! Because we live in globalized societies built on inequality and profit, because the content of a song, a movie or a book are assets in a struggle to survive without thank you, every citizen has the moral right to take a digital copy of a work whatsoever. Because IT is an international language, the secrets of the world are nowadays written in Adobe and Microsoft, it is legitimate to the hacker. Finally, because poverty is the experimental field of pharmaceutical industry, medicine should be free of any patent. 

Nowadays, anyone with a computer is both producer and Pirate. We are all citizens of the Internet, this is our new nation, the only territory it is justified to defend and protect. Internet is a land of information and knowledge. Everyone should be able to trample without financial consideration; only large companies should pay to use it. 

Internet generates ""Internets"" situations that exist not only online but also in the physical world, determined by what happens on the network. The time has come to establish a Global Movement piracy. Freedom to infringe copyright, the unrestricted access to knowledge and medical treatments, these are our new ""commons."" These are universal rights, and as such, the authorities did not concede without a fight, but the fight will deliver unique because for the first time, crowds spontaneously break the law on a global scale.

Introduction

Jaron Lanier, a pioneer in virtual reality, musician, and currently the lead scientist for the National Tele-Immersion Initiative, worries about the future of human culture more than the gadgets. In his ""Half a Manifesto"" he takes on those he terms the ""cybernetic totalists"" who do not seem ""to not have been educated in the tradition of scientific skepticism. I understand why they are intoxicated. There IS a compelling simple logic behind their thinking and elegance in thought is infectious.""

""There is a real chance that evolutionary psychology, artificial intelligence, Moore's Law fetishizing, and the rest of the package, will catch on in a big way, as big as Freud or Marx did in their times. Or bigger, since these ideas might end up essentially built into the software that runs our society and our lives. If that happens, the ideology of cybernetic totalist intellectuals will be amplified from novelty into a force that could cause suffering for millions of people.

""The greatest crime of Marxism wasn't simply that much of what it claimed was false, but that it claimed to be the sole and utterly complete path to understanding life and reality. Cybernetic eschatology shares with some of history's worst ideologies a doctrine of historical predestination. There is nothing more gray, stultifying, or dreary than a life lived inside the confines of a theory. Let us hope that the cybernetic totalists learn humility before their day in the sun arrives.""

ONE HALF A MANIFESTO

[JARON LANIER:] And so I'll here share my thoughts with the respondents of edge.org, many of whom are, as much as anyone, responsible for this revolution, one which champions the assent of cybernetic technology as culture.

The dogma I object to is composed of a set of interlocking beliefs and doesn't have a generally accepted overarching name as yet, though I sometimes call it ""cybernetic totalism"". It has the potential to transform human experience more powerfully than any prior ideology, religion, or political system ever has, partly because it can be so pleasing to the mind, at least initially, but mostly because it gets a free ride on the overwhelmingly powerful technologies that happen to be created by people who are, to a large degree, true believers.

Edge readers might be surprised by my use of the word ""cybernetic"". I find the word problematic, so I'd like to explain why I chose it. I searched for a term that united the diverse ideas I was exploring, and also connected current thinking and culture with earlier generations of thinkers who touched on similar topics. The original usage of ""cybernetic"", as by Norbert Weiner, was certainly not restricted to digital computers. It was originally meant to suggest a metaphor between marine navigation and a feedback device that governs a mechanical system, such as a thermostat. Weiner certainly recognized and humanely explored the extraordinary reach of this metaphor, one of the most powerful ever expressed.

I hope no one will think I'm equating Cybernetics and what I'm calling Cybernetic Totalism. The distance between recognizing a great metaphor and treating it as the only metaphor is the same as the distance between humble science and dogmatic religion.

Here is a partial roster of the component beliefs of cybernetic totalism:

1) That cybernetic patterns of information provide the ultimate and best way to understand reality. 

2) That people are no more than cybernetic patterns. 

3) That subjective experience either doesn't exist, or is unimportant because it is some sort of ambient or peripheral effect. 

4) That what Darwin described in biology, or something like it, is in fact also the singular, superior description of all creativity and culture. 


5) That qualitative as well as quantitative aspects of inform
ation systems will be accelerated by Moore's Law.

And finally, the most dramatic:

6) That biology and physics will merge with computer science (becoming biotechnology and nanotechnology), resulting in life and the physical universe becoming mercurial; achieving the supposed nature of computer software. Furthermore, all of this will happen very soon! Since computers are improving so quickly, they will overwhelm all the other cybernetic processes, like people, and will fundamentally change the nature of what's going on in the familiar neighborhood of Earth at some moment when a new ""criticality"" is achieved- maybe in about the year 2020. To be a human after that moment will be either impossible or something very different than we now can know.

During the last twenty years a stream of books has gradually informed the larger public about the belief structure of the inner circle of Digerati, starting softly, for instance with Godel, Escher, Bach, and growing more harsh with recent entries such as The Age of Spiritual Machines by Ray Kurtzweil.

Recently, public attention has finally been drawn to #6, the astonishing belief in an eschatological cataclysm in our lifetimes, brought about when computers become the ultra-intelligent masters of physical matter and life. So far as I can tell, a large number of my friends and colleagues believe in some version of this immanent doom.

I am quite curious who, among the eminent thinkers who largely accept some version of the first five points, are also comfortable with the sixth idea, the eschatology. In general, I find that technologists, rather than natural scientists, have tended to be vocal about the possibility of a near-term criticality. I have no idea, however, what figures like Richard Dawkins or Daniel Dennett make of it. Somehow I can't imagine these elegant theorists speculating about whether nanorobots might take over the planet in twenty years. It seems beneath their dignity. And yet, the eschatologies of Kurtzweil, Moravec, and Drexler follow directly and, it would seem, inevitably, from an understanding of the world that has been most sharply articulated by none other than Dawkins and Dennett. Do Dawkins, Dennett, and others in their camp see some flaw in logic that insulates their thinking from the eschatological implications? The primary candidate for such a flaw as I see it is that cyber-armageddonists have confused ideal computers with real computers, which behave differently. My position on this point can be evaluated separately from my admittedly provocative positions on the first five points, and I hope it will be.

Why this is only ""one half of a manifesto"": I hope that readers will not think that I've sunk into some sort of glum rejection of digital technology. In fact, I'm more delighted than ever to be working in computer science and I find that it's rather easy to adopt a humanistic framework for designing digital tools. There is a lovely global flowering of computer culture already in place, arising for the most independently of the technological elites, which implicitly rejects the ideas I am attacking here. A full manifesto would attempt to describe and promote this positive culture.

I will now examine the five beliefs that must precede acceptance of the new eschatology, and then consider the eschatology itself.

Here we go:

Cybernetic Totalist Belief #1: That cybernetic patterns of information provide the ultimate and best way to understand reality.

There is an undeniable rush of excitement experienced by those who first are able to perceive a phenomenon cybernetically. For example, while I believe I can imagine what a thrill it must have been to use early photographic equipment in the 19th century, I can't imagine that any outsider could comprehend the sensation of being around early computer graphics technology in the nineteen-seventies. For here was not merely a way to make and show images, but a metaframework that subsumed all possible images. Once you can understand something in a way that you can shove it into a computer, you have cracked its code, transcended any particularity it might have at a given time. It was as if we had become the Gods of vision and had effectively created all possible images, for they would merely be reshufflings of the bits in the computers we had before us, completely under our command.

The cybernetic impulse is initially driven by ego (though, as we shall see, in its end game, which has not yet arrived, it will become the enemy of ego). For instance, Cybernetic Totalists look at culture and see ""memes"", or autonomous mental tropes that compete for brain space in humans somewhat like viruses. In doing so they not only accomplish a triumph of ""campus imperialism"", placing themselves in an imagined position of superior understanding vs. the whole of the humanities, but they also avoid having to pay much attention to the particulars of culture in a given time and place. Once you have subsumed something into its cybernetic reduction, any particular reshuffling of its bits seems unimportant.

Belief #1 appeared on the stage almost immediately with the first computers. It was articulated by the first generation of computer scientists; Weiner, Shannon, Turing. It is so fundamental that it isn't even stated anymore within the inner circle. It is so well rooted that it is difficult for me to remove myself from my all-encompassing intellectual environment long enough to articulate an alternative to it.

An alternative might be this: A cybernetic model of a phenomenon can never be the sole favored model, because we can't even build computers that conform to such models. Real computers are completely different from the ideal computers of theory. They break for reasons that are not always analyzable, and they seem to intrinsically resist many of our endeavors to improve them, in large part due to legacy and lock-in, among other problems. We imagine ""pure"" cybernetic systems but we can only prove we know how to build fairly dysfunctional ones. We kid ourselves when we think we understand something, even a computer, merely because we can model or digitize it.

There is also an epistemological problem that bothers me, even though my colleagues by and large are willing to ignore it. I don't think you can measure the function or even the existence of a computer without a cultural context for it. I don't think Martians would necessarily be able to distinguish a Macintosh from a space heater.

The above disputes ultimately turn on a combination of technical arguments about information theory and philosophical positions that largely arise from taste and faith.

So I try to augment my positions with pragmatic considerations, and some of these will begin to appear in my thoughts on...

Belief #2: That people are no more than cybernetic patterns

Every cybernetic totalist fantasy relies on artificial intelligence. It might not immediately be apparent why such fantasies are essential to those who have them. If computers are to become smart enough to design their own successors, initiating a process that will lead to God-like omniscience after a number of ever swifter passages from one generation of computers to the next, someone is going to have to write the software that gets the process going, and humans have given absolutely no evidence of being able to write such software. So the idea is that the computers will somehow become smart on their own and write their own software.

My primary objection to this way of thinking is pragmatic: It results in the creation of poor quality real world software in the present. Cybernetic Totalists live with their heads in the future and are willing to accept obvious flaws in present software in support of a fantasy world that might never appear.

The whole enterprise of Artificial Intelligence is based on an intellectual mistake, and continues to expensively turn out poorly designed software as it is re-marketed under a new name for every new generation of programmers. Lately it has been called ""intelligent agents"". Last time around it was called ""expert systems"".

Let's start at the beginning, when the idea first appeared. In Turing's famous thought experiment, a human judge is asked to determine which of two correspondents is human, and which is machine. If the judge cannot tell, Turing asserts that the computer should be treated as having essentially achieved the moral and intellectual status of personhood.

Turing's mistake was that he assumed that the only explanation for a successful computer entrant would be that the computer had become elevated in some way; by becoming smarter, more human. There is another, equally valid explanation of a winning computer, however, which is that the human had become less intelligent, less human-like.

An official Turing Test is held every year, and while the substantial cash prize has not been claimed by a program as yet, it will certainly be won sometime in the coming years. My view is that this event is distracting everyone from the real Turing Tests that are already being won. Real, though miniature, Turing Tests are happening all the time, every day, whenever a person puts up with stupid computer software.

For instance, in the United States, we organize our financial lives in order to look good to the pathetically simplistic computer programs that determine our credit ratings. We borrow money when we don't need to, for example, to feed the type of data to the programs that we know they are programmed to respond to favorably.

In doing this, we make ourselves stupid in order to make the computer software seem smart. In fact we continue to trust the credit rating software even though there has been an epidemic of personal bankruptcies during a time of very low unemployment and great prosperity.

We have caused the Turing test to be passed. There is no epistemological difference between artificial intelligence and the acceptance of badly designed computer software.

My argument can be taken as an attack against the belief in eventual computer sentience, but a more sophisticated reading would be that it argues for a pragmatic advantage to holding an anti-AI belief (because those who believe in AI are more likely to put up with bad software). More importantly, I'm hoping the reader can see that Artificial Intelligence is better understood as a belief system instead of a technology.

The AI belief system is a direct explanation for a lot of bad software in the world, such as the annoying features in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint that guess at what the user really wanted to type. Almost every person I have asked has hated these features, and I have never met an engineer at Microsoft who could successfully turn the features completely off on my computer (running Mac Office '98), even though that is supposed to be possible.

Belief #3: That subjective experience either doesn't exist, or is unimportant because it is some sort of ambient or peripheral effect.

There is a new moral struggle taking shape over the question of when ""souls"" should be attributed to perceived patterns in the world.

Computers, genes, and the economy are some of the entities which appear to Cybernetic Totalists to populate reality today, along with human beings. It is certainly true that we are confronted with non-human and meta-human actors in our lives on a constant basis and these players sometimes appear to be more powerful than us.

So, the new moral question is: Do we make decisions solely on the basis of the needs and wants of ""traditional"" biological humans, or are any of these other players deserving of consideration?

I propose to make use of a simple image to consider the alternative points of view. This image is of an imaginary circle that each person draws around him/herself. We shall call this ""the circle of empathy"". On the inside of the circle are those things that are considered deserving of empathy, and the corresponding respect, rights, and practical treatment as approximate equals. On the outside of the circle are those things that are considered less important, less alive, less deserving of rights. (This image is only a tool for thought, and should certainly not be taken as my complete model for human psychology or moral dilemmas.) Roughly speaking, liberals hope to expand the circle, while conservatives wish to contract it.

Should computers, perhaps at some point in the future, be placed inside the ""circle of empathy""? The idea that they should is held close to the heart by the Cybernetic Totalists, who populate the elite technological academies and the businesses of the ""new economy"".

There has often been a tender, but unintended humor in the argumentative writing by advocates of eventual computer sentience. The quest to rationally prove the possibility of sentience in a computer (or perhaps in the internet), is the modern version of proving God's existence. As is the case with the history of God, a great many great minds have spent excesses of energy on this quest, and eventually a cybernetically-minded 21st century version of Kant will appear in order to present a tedious ""proof"" that such adventures are futile. I simply don't have the patience to be that person.

As it happens, in the last five years or so arguments about computer sentience have started to subside. The idea is assumed to be true by most of my colleagues; for them, the argument is over. It is not over for me.

I must report that back when the arguments were still white hot, it was the oddest feeling to debate someone like Cybernetic Totalist philosopher Daniel Dennett. He would state that humans were simply specialized computers, and that imposing some fundamental ontological distinction between humans and computers was a sentimental waste of time.

""But don't you experience your life? Isn't experience something apart from what you could measure in a computer?"", I would say. My debating opponent would typically say something like ""Experience is just an illusion created because there is one part of a machine (you) that needs to create a model of the function of the rest of the machine- that part is your experiential center.""

I would retort that experience is the only thing that isn't reduced by illusion. That even illusion is itself experience. A correlate, alas, is that experience is the very thing that can only be experienced. This lead me into the odd position of publicly wondering if some of my opponents simply lacked internal experience. (I once suggested that among all humanity, one could only definitively prove a lack of internal experience in certain professional philosophers.)

In truth, I think my perennial antagonists do have internal experience but choose not to admit it in public for a variety of reasons, most often because they enjoy annoying others.

Another motivation might be the ""Campus Imperialism"" I invoked earlier. Representatives of each academic discipline occasionally assert that they possess a most privileged viewpoint that somehow contains or subsumes the viewpoints of their rivals. Physicists were the alpha-academics for much of the twentieth century, though in recent decades ""postmodern"" humanities thinkers managed to stage something of a comeback, at least in their own minds. But technologists are the inevitable winners of this game, as they change the very components of our lives out from under us. It is tempting to many of them, apparently, to leverage this power to suggest that they also possess an ultimate understanding of reality, which is something quite apart from having tremendous influence on it.

Another avenue of explanation might be neo-Freudian, considering that the primary inventor of the idea of machine sentience, Alan Turing, was such a tortured soul. Turing died in an apparent suicide brought on by his having developed breasts as a result of enduring a hormonal regimen intended to reverse his homosexuality. It was during this tragic final period of his life that he argued passionately for machine sentience, and I have wondered whether he was engaging in a highly original new form of psychological escape and denial; running away from sexuality and mortality by becoming a computer.

At any rate, what is peculiar and revealing is that my cybernetic totalist friends confuse the viability of a perspective with its triumphant superiority. It is perfectly true that one can think of a person as a gene's way of propagating itself, as per Dawkins, or as a sexual organ used by machines to make more machines, as per McLuhan (as quoted in the masthead of every issue of Wired Magazine), and indeed it can even be beautiful to think from these perspectives from time to time. As the anthropologist Steve Barnett pointed out, however, it would be just as reasonable to assert that ""A person is shit's way of making more shit.""

So let us pretend that the new Kant has already appeared and done his/her inevitable work. We can then say: The placement of one's circle of empathy is ultimately a matter of faith. We must accept the fact that we are forced to place the circle somewhere, and yet we cannot exclude extra-rational faith from our choice of where to place it.

My personal choice is to not place computers inside the circle. In this article I am stating some of my pragmatic, esthetic, and political reasons for this, though ultimately my decision rests on my particular faith. My position is unpopular and even resented in my professional and social environment.

Belief #4: That what Darwin described in biology, or something like it, is in fact also the singular, superior description of all possible creativity and culture.

Cybernetic totalists are obsessed with Darwin, for he described the closest thing we have to an algorithm for creativity. Darwin answers what would otherwise be a big hole in the Dogma: How will cybernetic systems be smart and creative enough to invent a post-human world? In order to embrace an eschatology in which the computers become smart as they become fast, some kind of Deus ex Machina must be invoked, and it has a beard.

Unfortunately, in the current climate I must take a moment to state that I am not a creationist. I am in this essay criticizing what I perceive to be intellectual laziness; a retreat from trying to understand problems and instead hope for software that evolves itself. I am not suggesting that Nature required some extra element beyond natural evolution to create people.

I also don't meant to imply that there is a completely unified block of people opposing me, all of whom think exactly the same thoughts. There are in fact numerous variations of Darwinian eschatology. Some of the most dramatic renditions have not come from scientists or engineers, but from writers such as Kevin Kelly and Robert Wright, who have become entranced with broadened interpretations of Darwin. In their works, reality is perceived as a big computer program running the Darwin algorithm, perhaps headed towards some sort of Destiny.

Many of my technical colleagues also see at least some form of a causal arrow in evolution pointing to an ever greater degree of a hard-to-characterize something as time passes. The words used to describe that something are themselves hard to define; It is said to include increased complexity, organization, and representation. To computer scientist Danny Hillis, people seem to have more of such a thing than, say, single cell organisms, and it is natural to wonder if perhaps there will someday be some new creatures with even more of it than is found in people. (And of course the future birth of the new ""more so"" species is usually said to be related to computers.) Contrast this perspective with that of Stephen Jay Gould who argues in Full House that if there's an arrow in evolution, it's towards greater diversity over time, and we unlikely creatures known as humans, having arisen as one tiny manifestation of a massive, blind exploration of possible creatures, only imagine that the whole process was designed to lead to us.

There is no harder idea to test than an anthropic one, or its refutation. I'll admit that I tend to side with Gould on this one, but it is more important to point out an epistemological conundrum that should be considered by Darwinian eshatologists. If mankind is the measure of evolution thus far, then we will also be the measure of successor species that might be purported to be ""more evolved"" than us. We'll have to anthropomorphize in order to perceive this ""greater than human"" form of life, especially if it exists inside an information space such as the internet.

In other words, we'll be as reliable in assessing the status of the new super-beings as we are in assessing the traits of pet dogs in the present. We aren't up to the task. Before you tell me that it will be overwhelmingly obvious when the superintelligent new cyber-species arrives, visit a dog show. Or a gathering of people who believe they have been abducted by aliens in UFOs. People are demonstrably insane when it comes to assessing non-human sentience.

There is, however, no question that the movement to interpret Darwin more broadly, and in particular to bring him into psychology and the humanities has offered some luminous insights that will someday be part of an improved understanding of nature, including human nature. I enjoy this stream of thought on various levels. It's also, let's admit it, impossible for a computer scientist not to be flattered by works which place what is essentially a form of algorithmic computation at the center of reality, and these thinkers tend to be confident and crisp and to occasionally have new and good ideas.

And yet I think cybernetic totalist Darwinians are often brazenly incompetent at public discourse and may be in part responsible, however unintentionally, for inciting a resurgence of fundamentalist religious reaction against rational biology. They seem to come up with takes on Darwin that are calculated to not only antagonize, but alienate those who don't share their views. Declarations from the ""nerdiest"" of the evolutionary psychologists can be particularly irritating.

One example that comes to mind is the recent book, The Natural History of Rape by Randy Thornhill and Craig T. Palmer, declaring that rape is a ""natural"" way to spread genes around. We have seen all sorts of propositions tied to Darwin with a veneer of rationality. In fact you can argue almost any position using a Darwinian strategy.

For instance, Thornhill and Palmer go so far as to suggest that those who disagree with them are victims of evolutionary programming for the need to believe in a fictitious altruism in human nature. The authors say it is altruistic-seeming to not believe in evolutionary psychology, because such skepticism makes a public display of one's belief in brotherly love. Displays of altruism are said to be attractive, and therefore to improve one's ability to lure mates. By this logic, evolutionary psychologists should soon breed themselves out of the population. Unless they resort to rape.

At any rate, Darwin's idea of evolution was of a different order than scientific theories that had come before, for at least two reasons. The most obvious and explosive reason was that the subject matter was so close to home. It was a shock to the 19th century mind to think of animals as blood relatives, and that shock continues to this day.

The second reason is less often recognized. Darwin created a style of reduction that was based on emergent principles instead of underlying laws (though some recent speculative physics theories can have a Darwinian flavor). There isn't any evolutionary ""force"" analogous to, say, electromagnetism. Evolution is a principle that can be discerned as emerging in events, but it cannot be described precisely as a force that directs events. This is a subtle distinction. The story of each photon is the same, in a way that the story of each animal and plant is different. (Of course there are wonderful examples of precise, quantitative statements Darwinian theory and corresponding experiments, but these don't take place at anywhere close to the level of human experience, which is whole organisms that have complex behaviors in environments.) ""Story"" is the operative word. Evolutionary thought has almost always been applied to specific situations through stories.

A story, unlike a theory, invites embroidery and variation, and indeed stories gain their communicative power by resonance with more primal stories. It is possible to learn physics without inventing a narrative in one's head to give meaning to photons and black holes. But it seems that it is impossible to learn Darwinian evolution without also developing an internal narrative to relate it to other stories one knows. At least no public thinker on the subject seems to have confronted Darwin without building a bridge to personal value systems.

But beyond the question of subjective flavoring, there remains the problem of whether Darwin has explained enough. Is it not possible that there remains an as-yet unarticulated idea that explains aspects of achievement and creativity that Darwin does not?

For instance, is Darwinian-styled explanation sufficient to understand the process of rational thought? There are a plethora of recent theories in which the brain is said to produce random distributions of subconscious ideas that compete with one another until only the best one has survived, but do these theories really fit with what people do?

In nature, evolution appears to be brilliant at optimizing, but stupid at strategizing. (The mathematical image that expresses this idea is that ""blind"" evolution has enourmous trouble getting unstuck from a local minima in an energy landscape.) The classic question would be: How could evolution have made such marvelous feet, claws, fins, and paws, but have missed the wheel? There are plenty of environments in which creatures would benefit from wheels, so why haven't any appeared? Not even once? (A great long term art project for some rebellious kid in school now: Genetically engineer an animal with wheels! See if DNA can be made to do it.)

People came up with the wheel and numerous other useful inventions that seem to have eluded evolution. It is possible that the explanation is simply that hands had access to a different set of inventions than DNA, even though both were guided by similar processes. But it seems to me premature to treat such an interpretation as a certainty. Is it not possible that in rational thought the brain does some as yet unarticulated thing that might have originated in a Darwinian process, but that cannot be explained by it?

The first two or three generations of artificial intelligence researchers took it as a given that blind evolution in itself couldn't be the whole of the story, and assumed that there were elements that distinguished human mentation from other Earthly processes. For instance, humans were thought by many to build abstract representations of the world in their minds, while the process of evolution needn't do that. Furthermore, these representations seemed to possess extraordinary qualities like the fearsome and perpetually elusive ""common sense"". After decades of failed attempts to build similar abstractions in computers, the field of AI gave up, but without admitting it. Surrender was couched as merely a series of tactical retreats. AI these days is often conceived as more of a craft than a branch of science or engineering. A great many practitioners I've spoken with lately hope to see software evolve that does various things but seem to have sunk to an almost ""post-modern"", or cynical lack of concern with understanding how these gizmos might actually work.

It is important to remember that craft-based cultures can come up with plenty of useful technologies, and that the motivation for our predecessors to embrace the Enlightenment and the ascent of rationality was not just to make more technologies more quickly. There was also the idea of Humanism, and a belief in the goodness of rational thinking and understanding. Are we really ready to abandon that?

Finally, there is an empirical point to be made: There has now been over a decade of work worldwide in Darwinian approaches to generating software, and while there have been some fascinating and impressive isolated results, and indeed I enjoy participating in such research, nothing has arisen from the work that would make software in general any better- as I'll ddescribe in the next section.

So, while I love Darwin, I won't count on him to write code. 

Belief #5: That qualitative as well as quantitative aspects of information systems will be accelerated by Moore's Law.

The hardware side of computers keeps on getting better and cheaper at an exponential rate known by the moniker ""Moore's Law"". Every year and a half or so computation gets roughly twice as fast for a given cost. The implications of this are dizzying and so profound that they induce vertigo on first apprehension. What could a computer that was a million times faster than the one I am writing this text on be able to do? Would such a computer really be incapable of doing whatever it is my human brain does? The quantity of a ""million"" is not only too large to grasp intuitively, it is not even accessible experimentally for present purposes, so speculation is not irrational. What is stunning is to realize that many of us will find out the answer in our lifetimes, for such a computer might be a cheap consumer product in about, say 30 years.

This breathtaking vista must be starkly contrasted with the Great Shame of computer science, which is that we don't seem to be able to write software much better as computers get much faster. Computer software continues to disappoint. How I hated UNIX back in the seventies - that devilish accumulator of data trash, obscurer of function, enemy of the user! If anyone had told me back then that getting back to embarrassingly primitive UNIX would be the great hope and investment obsession of the year 2000, merely because it's name was changed to LINUX and its source code was opened up again, I never would have had the stomach or the heart to continue in computer science.

If anything, there's a reverse Moore's Law observable in software: As processors become faster and memory becomes cheaper, software becomes correspondingly slower and more bloated, using up all available resources. Now I know I'm not being entirely fair here. We have better speech recognition and language translation than we used to, for example, and we are learning to run larger data bases and networks. But our core techniques and technologies for software simply haven't kept up with hardware. (Just as some newborn race of superintelligent robots are about to consume all humanity, our dear old species will likely be saved by a Windows crash. The poor robots will linger pathetically, begging us to reboot them, even though they'll know it would do no good.)

There are various reasons that software tends to be unwieldly, but a primary one is what I like to call ""brittleness"". Software breaks before it bends, so it demands perfection in a universe that prefers statistics. This in turn leads to all the pain of legacy/lock in, and other perversions. The distance between the ideal computers we imagine in our thought experiments and the real computers we know how to unleash on the world could not be more bitter.

It is the fetishizing of Moore's Law that seduces researchers into complacency. If you have an exponential force on your side, surely it will ace all challenges. Who cares about rational understanding when you can instead really on an exponential extra-human fetish? But processing power isn't the only thing that scales impressively; so do the problems that processors have to solve.

Here's an example I offer to non-technical people to illustrate this point. Ten years ago I had a laptop with an indexing program that let me search for files by content. In order to respond quickly enough when I performed a search, it went through all the files in advance and indexed them, just as search engines like Google index the internet today. The indexing process took about an hour.

Today I have a laptop that is hugely more capacious and faster in every dimension, as predicted by Moore's Law. However, I now have to let my indexing program run overnight to do its job. There are many other examples of computers seeming to get slower even though central processors are getting faster. Computer user interfaces tend to respond more slowly to user interface events, such as a keypress, than they did fifteen years ago, for instance. What's gone wrong?

The answer is complicated.

One part of the answer is fundamental. It turns out that when programs and datasets get bigger (and increasing storage and transmission capacities are driven by the same processes that drive Moore's exponential speedup), internal computational overhead often increases at a worse-than-linear rate. This is because of some nasty mathematical facts of life regarding algorithms. Making a problem twice as large usually makes it take a lot more than twice as long to solve. Some algorithms are worse in this way than others, and one aspect of getting a solid undergraduate education in computer science is learning about them. Plenty of problems have overheads that scale even more steeply than Moore's Law. Surprisingly few of the most essential algorithms have overheads that scale at a merely linear rate.

But that's only the beginning of the story. It's also true that if different parts of a system scale at different rates, and that's usually the case, one part might be overwhelmed by the other. In the case of my indexing program, the size of hard disks actually grew faster than the speed of interfaces to them. Overhead costs can be amplified by such examples of ""messy"" scaling, in which one part of a system cannot keep up with another. A bottleneck then appears, rather like girdlock in a poorly designed roadway. And the backup that results is just as bad as a morning commute on a typically inadequate roadway system. And just as tricky and expensive to plan for and prevent. (Trips on Manhattan streets were faster a hundred years ago than they are today. Horses are faster than cars.)

And then we come to our old antagonist, brittleness. The larger a piece of computer software gets, the more it is likely to be dominated by some form of legacy code, and the more brutal becomes the overhead of addressing the endless examples of subtle incompatibility that inevitably arise between chunks of software originally created in different contexts.

And even beyond these effects, there are failings of human character that worsen the state of software, and many of these are systemic and might arise even if non-human agents were writing the code. For instance, it is very time-consuming and expensive to plan ahead to make the tasks of future programmers easier, so each programmer tends to choose strategies that worsen the effects of brittleness. The time crunch faced by programmers is driven by none other than Moore's Law, which motivates an ever-faster turnaround of software revisions to get at least some form of mileage out of increasing processor speeds. So the result is often software that gets less efficient in some ways even as processors become faster.

I see no evidence that Moore's Law is steep enough to outrun all these problems without additional unforeseen intellectual achievements.

A fundamental statement of the question I'm examining here is: Does software tend to be unwieldly only because on human error, or is the difficulty intrinsic to the nature of software itself. If there is any credibility at all to the eschatological scenarios of Kurtzweil, Drexler, Moravec, et al, then this is the single most important question related to the future of mankind.

There is at least some metaphorical support for the possibility that software unwieldliness is intrinsic. In order to examine this possibility I'll have to break my own rule and be a cybernetic totalist for a moment.

Nature might seem to be less brittle than digital software, but if species are thought of as ""programs"", then it looks like nature also has a software crisis. Evolution itself has evolved, introducing sex, for instance, but evolution has never found a way to be any speed but very slow. This might be at least in part because it takes a long time to explore the space of possible variations of an exceedingly vast and complex causal system to find new configurations that are viable. Natural evolution's slowness as a medium of transformation is apparently systemic, rather than esulting from some inherent sluggishness in its component parts. On the contrary, adaptation is capable of achieving thrilling speed, in select circumstances. An example of fast change is the adaptation of germs to our efforts to eradicate them. Resistance to antibiotics is a notorious contemporary example of biological speed.

Both human-created software and natural selection seem to accrue hierarchies of layers that vary in their potential for speedy change. Slow-changing layers protect local theaters within which there is a potential for faster change. In computers, this is the divide between operating systems and applications, or between browsers and web pages. In biology, it might be seen, for example, in the divide between nature- and nurture-dominated dynamics in the human mind. But the lugubrious layers seem to usually define the overall character and potential of a system.

In the minds of some of my colleagues, all you have to do is identify one layer in a cybernetic system that's capable of fast change and then wait for Moore's Law to work it's magic. For instance, even if you're stuck with LINUX, you might implement a neural net program in it that eventually grows huge and fast enough (because of Moore's Law) to achieve a moment of insight and rewrite its own operating system. The problem is that in every example we know, a layer that can change fast also can't change very much. Germs can adopt to new drugs quickly, but would still take a very long time to evolve into Owls. This might be an inherent trade-off. For an example in the digital world, you can write a new JAVA applet pretty quickly, but it won't look very different from other quickly written applets- take a look at what's been done with applets and you'll see that this is true.

Now we finally come to...

Belief #6, the coming cybernetic cataclysm.

When a thoughtful person marvels at Moore's Law, there might be awe and there might be terror. One version of the terror was expressed recently by Bill Joy, in a cover story for Wired Magazine. Bill accepts the pronouncements of Ray Kurtzweil and others, who believe that Moore's Law will lead to autonomous machines, perhaps by the year 2020. That is the when computers will become, according to some estimates, about as powerful as human brains. (Not that anyone knows enough to really measure brains against computers yet. But for the sake of argument, let's suppose that the comparison is meaningful.) According to this scenario of the Terror, computers won't be stuck in boxes. They'll be more like robots, all connected together on the net, and they'll have a quite bag of tricks.

They'll be able to perform nano-manufacturing, for one thing. They'll quickly learn to reproduce and improve themselves. One fine day without warning, the new supermachines will brush humanity aside as casually as humans clear a forest for a new development. Or perhaps the machines will keep humans around to suffer the sort of indignity portrayed in the movie ""The Matrix"".

Even if the machines would otherwise choose to preserve their human progenitors, evil humans will be able to manipulate the machines to do vast harm to the rest of us. This is a different scenario that Bill also explores. Biotechnology will have advanced to the point that computer programs will be able to manipulate DNA as if it were Javascript. If computers can calculate the effects of drugs, genetic modifications, and other biological trickery, and if the tools to realize such tricks are cheap, then all it takes is a one madman to, say, create an epidemic targeted at a single race. Biotechnology without a strong, cheap information technology component would not be sufficiently potent to bring about this scenario. Rather, it is the ability of software running on fabulously fast computers to cheaply model and guide the manipulation of biology that is at the root of this variant of the Terror. I haven't been able to fully convey Bill's concerns in this brief account, but you get the idea.

My version of the Terror is different. We can already see how the biotechnology industry is setting itself up for decades of expensive software trouble. While there are all sorts of useful databases and modeling packages being developed by biotech firms and labs, they all exist in isolated developmental bubbles. Each such tool expects the world to conform to its requirements. Since the tools are so valuable, the world will do exactly that, but we should expect to see vast resources applied to the problem of getting data from bubble into another. There is no giant monolithic electronic brain being created with biological knowledge. There is instead a fractured mess of data and modeling fiefdoms. The medium for biological data transfer will continue to be sleep-deprived individual human researchers until some fabled future time when we know how to make software that is good at bridging bubbles on its own.

What is a long term future scenario like in which hardware keeps getting better and software remains mediocre? The great thing about crummy software is the amount of employment it generates. If Moore's Law is upheld for another twenty or thirty years, there will not only be a vast amount of computation going on Planet Earth, but also the maintenance of that computation will consume the efforts of almost every living person. We're talking about a planet of helpdesks.

I have argued elsewhere that this future would be a great thing, realizing the socialist dream of full employment by capitalist means. But let's consider the dark side.

Among the many processes that information systems make more efficient is the process of capitalism itself. A nearly friction-free economic environment allows fortunes to be accumulated in a few months instead of a few decades, but the individuals doing the accumulating are still living as long as they used to; longer, in fact. So those individuals who are good at getting rich have a chance to get richer before they die than their equally talented forebears.

There are two dangers in this. The smaller, more immediate danger is that young people acclimatized to a deliriously receptive economic environment might be emotionally wounded by what the rest of us would consider brief returns to normalcy. I do sometimes wonder if some of the students I work with who have gone on to dot com riches would be able to handle any financial frustration that lasted more than a few days without going into some sort of destructive depression or rage.

The greater danger is that the gulf between the richest and the rest could become transcendently grave. That is, even if we agree that a rising tide raises all ships, if the rate of the rising of the highest ships is greater than that of the lowest, they will become ever more separated. (And indeed, concentrations of wealth and poverty have increased during the Internet boom years in America.)

If Moore's Law or something like it is running the show, the scale of the separation could become astonishing. This is where my Terror resides, in considering the ultimate outcome of the increasing divide between the ultra-rich and the merely better off.

With the technologies that exist today, the wealthy and the rest aren't all that different; both bleed when pricked, for the classic example. But with the technology of the next twenty or thirty years they might become quite different indeed. Will the ultra-rich and the rest even be recognizable as the same species by the middle of the new century?

The possibilities that they will become essentially different species are so obvious and so terrifying that there is almost a banality in stating them. The rich could have their children made genetically more intelligent, beautiful, and joyous. Perhaps they could even be genetically disposed to have a superior capacity for empathy, but only to other people who meet some narrow range of criteria. Even stating these things seems beneath me, as if I were writing pulp science fiction, and yet the logic of the possibility is inescapable.

Let's explore just one possibility, for the sake of argument. One day the richest among us could turn nearly immortal, becoming virtual Gods to the rest of us. (An apparent lack of aging in both cell cultures and in whole organisms has been demonstrated in the laboratory.)

Let's not focus here on the fundamental questions of near immortality: whether it is moral or even desirable, or where one would find room if immortals insisted on continuing to have children. Let's instead focus on the question of whether immortality is likely to be expensive.

My guess is that immortality will be cheap if information technology gets much better, and expensive if software remains as crummy as it is.

I suspect that the hardware/software dichotomy will reappear in biotechnology, and indeed in other 21st century technologies. You can think of biotechnology as an attempt to make flesh into a computer, in the sense that biotechnology hopes to manage the processes of biology in ever greater detail, leading at some far horizon to perfect control. Likewise, nanotechnology hopes to do the same thing for materials science. If the body, and the material world at large become more manipulatable, more like a computer's memory, then the limiting factor will be the quality of the software that governs the manipulation.

Even though it's possible to program a computer to do virtually anything, we all know that's really not a sufficient description of computers. As I argued above: Getting computers to perform specific tasks of significant complexity in a reliable but modifiable way, without crashes or security breaches, is essentially impossible. We can only approximate this goal, and only at great expense.

Likewise, one can hypothetically program DNA to make virtually any modification in a living thing, and yet designing a particular modification and vetting it thoroughly will likely remain immensely difficult. (And, as I argued above, that might be one reason why biological evolution has never found a way to be anything speed other than very slow.) Similarly, one can hypothetically use nanotechnology to make matter do almost anything conceivable, but it will probably turn out to be much harder than we now imagine to get it do any particular thing of complexity without disturbing side effects. Scenarios that predict that biotechnology and nanotechnology will be able to quickly and cheaply create startling new things under the sun also must imagine that computers will become semi-autonomous, superintelligent, virtuoso engineers. But computers will do no such thing if the last half century of progress in software can serve as a predictor of the next half century.

In other words, bad software will make biological hacks like near-immortality expensive instead of cheap in the future. Even if everything else gets cheaper, the information technology side of the effort will get more expensive.

Cheap near-immortality for everyone is a self-limiting proposition. There isn't enough room to accommodate such an adventure. Also, roughly speaking, if immortality was to become cheap, so would the horrific biological weapons of Bill's scenario. On the other hand, expensive near immortality is something the world could absorb, at least for a good long while, because there would be fewer people involved. Maybe they could even keep the effort quiet.

So, here is the irony. The very features of computers which drive us crazy today, and keep so many of us gainfully employed, are the best insurance our species has for long term survival as we explore the far reaches of technological possibility. On the other hand, those same annoying qualities are what could make the 21st century into a madhouse scripted by the fantasies and desperate aspirations of the super-rich.

Conclusion

I share the belief of my cybernetic totalist colleagues that there will be huge and sudden changes in the near future brought about by technology. The difference is that I believe that whatever happens will be the responsibility of individual people who do specific things. I think that treating technology as if it were autonomous is the ultimate self-fulfilling prophecy. There is no difference between machine autonomy and the abdication of human responsibility.

Let's take the ""nanobots take over"" scenario. It seems to me that the most likely scenarios involve either:

a) Super-nanobots everywhere that run old software- linux, say. This might be interesting. Good video games will be available, anyway.

b) Super-nanobots that evolve as fast as natural nanobots- so don't do much for millions of years.

c) Super-nanobots that do new things soon, but are dependent on humans. In all these cases humans will be in control, for better or for worse.

So, therefore, I'll worry about the future of human culture more than I'll worry about the gadgets. And what worries me about the ""Young Turk"" cultural temperament seen in cybernetic totalists is that they seem to not have been educated in the tradition of scientific skepticism. I understand why they are intoxicated. There IS a compelling simple logic behind their thinking and elegance in thought is infectious.

There is a real chance that evolutionary psychology, artificial intelligence, Moore's Law fetishizing, and the rest of the package, will catch on in a big way, as big as Freud or Marx did in their times. Or bigger, since these ideas might end up essentially built into the software that runs our society and our lives. If that happens, the ideology of cybernetic totalist intellectuals will be amplified from novelty into a force that could cause suffering for millions of people.

The greatest crime of Marxism wasn't simply that much of what it claimed was false, but that it claimed to be the sole and utterly complete path to understanding life and reality. Cybernetic eschatology shares with some of history's worst ideologies a doctrine of historical predestination. There is nothing more gray, stultifying, or dreary than a life lived inside the confines of a theory. Let us hope that the cybernetic totalists learn humility before their day in the sun arrives.

,,Kerry Mitchell,,"In <em>The Fractal Art Manifesto</em>, Kerry Mitchell attempts to define fractal rt, rather than a computerized art without human input, as an expressive and creative artistic endeavor.",,,EN,,,,,,,"<a href=""https://www.fractalus.com/info/manifesto.htm"">https://www.fractalus.com/info/manifesto.htm</a>","Fractal Art, Two dimensional visual art","As a genre, Fractal Art (FA) has been around for approximately 15-20 years. Its first major public display may be considered to be an article about the Mandelbrot Set published in ""Scientific American"" in 1985. Since then, many advances have been made, both in fractal rendering capabilities and in the understanding of fractal geometry. Perhaps now is an opportune time to make a defining statement about what is (and what is not) Fractal Art. 
    Fractal Art is a genre concerned with fractals—shapes or sets characterized by self affinity (small portions of the image resemble the overall shape) and an infinite amount of detail, at all scales. Fractals are typically created on a digital computer, using an iterative numerical process. Lately, images that are not technically fractals, but that share the same basic generating technique and environment, have been welcomed into the FA world. 
    Fractal Art is a subclass of two dimensional visual art, and is in many respects similar to photography—another art form which was greeted by skepticism upon its arrival. Fractal images typically are manifested as prints, bringing Fractal Artists into the company of painters, photographers, and printmakers. Fractals exist natively as electronic images. This is a format that traditional visual artists are quickly embracing, bringing them into FA's digital realm. 
    Generating fractals can be an artistic endeavor, a mathematical pursuit, or just a soothing diversion. However, FA is clearly distinguished from other digital activities by what it is, and by what it is not. 
 
Fractal Art is not:

 	Computer(ized) Art, in the sense that the computer does all the work. The work is executed on a computer, but only at the direction of the artist. Turn a computer on and leave it alone for an hour. When you come back, no art will have been generated.
 	Random, in the sense of stochastic, or lacking any rules. Being based on mathematics, fractal rendering is the essence of determinism. Apply the same image generation steps, and the same result will follow. Slight changes in process usually lead to slight changes in product, making FA an activity which can be learned, not a haphazard process of pushing buttons and turning knobs.
 	Random, in the sense of unpredictable. Fractal Art, like any new pursuit, will have aspects unknown to the novice, but familiar to the master. Through experience and education, the techniques of FA can be learned. As in painting or chess, the essentials are quickly grasped, although they can take a lifetime to fully understand and control. Over time, the joy of serendipitous discovery is replaced by the joy of self-determined creation.
 	Something that anyone with a computer can do well. Anyone can pick up a camera and take a snapshot. However, not just anyone can be an Ansel Adams or an Annie Liebovitz. Anyone can take brush in hand and paint. However, not just anyone can be a Georgia O'Keeffe or a Pablo Picasso. Indeed, anyone with a computer can create fractal images, but not just anyone will excel at creating Fractal Art.

Fractal Art is:

 	Expressive. Through a painter's colors, a photographer's use of light and shadow, or a dancer's movements, artists learn to express and evoke all manner of ideas and emotions. Fractal Artists are no less capable of using their medium as a similarly expressive language, as they are equipped with all the essential tools of the traditional visual artist.
 	Creative. The final fractal image must be created, just as the photograph or the painting. It can be created as a representational work, and abstraction of the basic fractal form, or as a nonrepresentational piece. The Fractal Artist begins with a blank ""canvas"", and creates an image, bringing together the same basic elements of color, composition, balance, etc., used by the traditional visual artist.
 	Requiring of input, effort, and intelligence. The Fractal Artist must direct the assembly of the calculation formulas, mappings, coloring schemes, palettes, and their requisite parameters. Each and every element can and will be tweaked, adjusted, aligned, and re-tweaked in the effort to find the right combination. The freedom to manipulate all these facets of a fractal image brings with it the obligation to understand their use and their effects. This understanding requires intelligence and thoughtfulness from the Artist.",<em>The Fractal Art Manifesto</em>,,,,2014-07-20T19:45:25+00:00,9,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/9,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=36,36,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T14:40:17+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Digital Art, Fractal Art",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/36

Importantly, Griffin hails dissimulation as the foundation of digital imaging here, underscoring the notion that the computer's content is completely malleable.",,,EN,,,,The New York Times,,,"<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/1121griffin.html"">http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/1121griffin.html</a>","Digital Art, Composition","A formulation by Marshall McLuhan that has become axiomatic to me is that the content of any new medium is an older medium.
A corollary to this is the notion that it takes some time before the true nature of the new medium is understood, both in terms of its social consequences and its proper application -- that is, until one that takes advantage of its true aesthetic potential.

Presumably, it is the serious artist, more specifically the ""avant garde"" artist who is the first to recognize the intrinsic nature of a new medium. In this schema, the content of film, for example, was the novel, but it took an Eisenstien to understand what was filmic about film. This seems to work pretty well for most technologies -- the content of the car (an extension of the foot) is the horse-drawn buggy, the content of the telegraph (an extension of the voice) is print, the content of video (an extension of the eye) is film, etc.

What, then, is the content of the computer? Part of the problem, of course, is how you define computer. In the case of the earliest electronic computers, as with the abacus, the content of computers was, well, computing, as in arithmetic and mathematical calculations. But today's computers, even the humble little box that sits in front of you, is positively omnivorous when it comes to content. What's more, each year it gets not only hungrier but better at assimilating what is already part of the diet.

I am an artist who produces primarily two-dimensional works, ranging from paintings to drawings to photos, by themselves and in combination. So for me, the content of the computer is all two-dimensional media -- in other words, everything I do. Personally, this has had the effect of producing an emotional toggle between giddy excitement and the vertigo of over-choice.

On the excitement side, there is a definite sense of frontier. Though it may not seem like it, digital imaging is freshly out of the womb, as newborn as photography was in the 1830s. Much of the hardware is still embryonic; for example the digital camera. (I won't buy one until they come up with something reasonably priced that will capture 10 million pixel color images in available light, hand held. So there.)

In addition, the theoretical, aesthetic and philosophical dimensions of the medium are still unclear. This makes it a bracing area of investigation for the fine artist, who characteristically develops work outside normal market demands.

I am the first to admit that this technology is powerfully seductive. (With my students and colleagues I habitually refer to the whole subject as ""digitalia."") When I first encountered Adobe Photoshop on the Mac, I knew I'd found the darkroom tool I'd been looking for all my life. After working with it and other programs for some time, it was hard to imagine ever not doing this, as if I'd found some forgotten wings that were there all along.

Nonetheless, I object to the soaring technophilia evidenced by the extravagant hype for All Things Digital. Some of it is harmlessly silly. For example, I heard some cyber-yuppie on MSNBC the other night refer to sexier looking computers as a ""paradigm shift.""

On a more ominous side, I sense a mass psychosis afoot: people worked up into a lather envisioning a future Brave New World filled with boys and their incredible toys. What's distressing to me is blind embrace of thingness at the expense of any kind of interiority. Particularly irritating is the gleeful acceptance of the notion of consciousness in silicon.

Why do people think that? No matter how subtly a machine mimics a conscious being, it's as dead as a doornail. My chess program beats me almost every time, but it doesn't know it, and certainly doesn't experience the joy of trouncing my sorry butt.

In the much-heralded future of techno-guys, if you elicit an ""ooooh"" from the beautiful cyber-device lying next to you as you touch its g-spot, do you really imagine it's for anybody but you? Well, perhaps that's the appeal.

You'd expect this kind of stuff from the pages of Wired magazine, but silicon consciousness gets support from some heavyweight intellectuals, like the philosopher Daniel Dennett. Most of the time this guy sounds like the towel boy for hard science, but he goes further with pontifications for mechanistic orthodoxy that most scientists themselves wouldn't presume. His rants on this issue amount to officious reductionism and technophilia masquerading as science and philosophy, and a stubborn confusion of model and reality.

While all this may seem somewhat far afield, I felt I had to position myself relative to the current buzz to avoid any misunderstanding when I assert that this technology is, in the McLuhan-esque sense, an extension of the human nervous system and brain and that the content of today's computer is the mental process. Though like all technological extensions, it is utterly a thing, a tool, these tools historically have had a profound effect on us, from radically altering our psychologies (McLuhan refers to ""sense ratios"") to changing the very structure of society. And all technologies before the computer were extensions of something humbler than the brain.

When students ask me what can be done with digital imaging, I tell them -- quite without fear of exaggeration -- that literally anything they can imagine (within the constraints of two dimensions) can be realized with our existing software, and that they have at their disposal a magic paintbrush that responds to their every creative whim. This, of course, is at once liberating and paralyzing, a fact that pushes some of them into a state of terminal geekhood, stuck in a myopic thrall of the tool itself. Clearly, this brush has teeth.

One of the most salient features of working digitally is the conflation of all the different forms of imagery that are fed into the computer. Photo, painting, video, drawing, film, direct scanning -- all these become a kind of uniform fodder for manipulation.

Besides the obvious and oft-cited havoc this wreaks on the veracity of any photographic ""record"" that has had the misfortune of making its way into a computer, this affects the artist in a way that is perhaps not immediately apparent. I'm referring to the characteristic look that images originally created in other media possess, a kind of base-level syntax that is almost felt rather than seen.

Consider, for example, the difference between film and video. Irrespective of content, these two media are polar opposites in terms of their feel. Compared with unmediated perceptions of the world, film buffers and aestheticizes vision. Video, on the other hand, seems more real than real, harsher somehow than unmediated visual perception. A brilliant illustration of the brutal potential of video is the ghastly sitcom sequence in the film ""Natural Born Killers"" in which the action is quite horribly enhanced by the eyeball-smushing oppression of the video image itself, a quality that holds up even when that image has been transferred to film.

So the challenge for the artist is that while the computer's content is completely malleable, one is also in the position of having to preserve, submerge or fake the signature look of another medium. Dissimulation operates constantly at the very foundation of digital imaging, and it is more intrinsic to this medium than anything previous.

For some software, like Fractal Design's Painter, fakery is the entire raison d'être. Curiously, this program falls short of simulating paintings, because the output has none of the physical characteristics of painting. What it really produces are images that resemble photographs of paintings that might have existed. And it does this well.

I tend to physicalize most of my digital imagery in one way or another, regardless of the program in which they were created. To this end, I employ various strategies. The works are usually scaled to the size of large paintings, and process is often apparent in undisguised tiling. In addition, images are buried under resin, transferred to canvas, and combined with painted passages and actual objects, not only to avoid the poster look of most digital output, but also to confound a clear reading of the media status of the image.

Many artists employ the computer to faithfully service other media through logical manipulations, but I am more attracted to the lawlessness of this new frontier. You could say that I have happily embraced the confusion, dissimulation, and subterfuge that are at the heart of working digitally.

The Creative Person’s Dilemma

Why do creative geeks (artists, musicians and writers that dwell primarily on the Internet) often live double lives? Because there isn’t a readily accessible system in place to allow a creative artist to chose to make a living from their craft without undue sacrifice, struggle and hardship. This “Jekyl and Hyde” geek spends their waking hours toiling away in an unfulfilling job while practicing their true passion at night and on the weekends.

This duality often leads to personal and professional frustration. It is incredibly unlikely that you, or me, or anyone you have ever met will become a famous musician or artist. The odds are not in our favor. But when you break down the artist’s desire into its most basic elements most of us do not desire fame, and many of us don’t desire wealth. What we desire is to be able to do the thing we are SUPPOSED to be doing (writing, drawing, whatever) all day without having to worry about what else we have to do to support ourselves and our families. We just want our passion to be our job. The reason that desire often gets confused with celebrity aspirations is that, until now, getting “discovered” and becoming rich and famous was the only sure fire way to get your art out there and into the hands of those that would appreciate it. This isn’t the case anymore.

Technology and the Internet have created a new class of creative individual. Today’s digital age artist has four things that previous generations did not. Information, Tools, Exposure and Communication.

Information: With access to the Internet, anyone can acquire almost any knowledge they seek quickly and usually for free. Art and music tutorials abound, as well as communities that offer mentorship and assistance in most creative fields.

Tools: Do you have a laptop? Then you have a full featured recording studio,  digital art studio, video production lab or creative writing and research tool. Once you have the computer you can augment it’s abilities with external recording sound cards, drawing tablets, midi controllers, video editing hardware or specialty software. The ability to layout a book, edit a movie or record an album used to be exclusive to professionals with years of training and tens of thousands of dollars worth of hardware (not to mention industry connections). Now everyone has access to this technology at an affordable price.

Exposure: I was in a band in highschool. We couldn’t afford to record a demo tape, so if we wanted anyone to hear our music (it wasn’t that good anyway) we had to play live for them. Booking shows in a small town in Texas was difficult as there was only two places to play and one was 18 and up. Getting exposure with more than a few dozen people a month was nearly impossible. Now an artist has access to hundreds of thousands of people (or millions) through outlets like YouTube, Myspace, Digg, Facebook or any other social area of the internet.

Communication: This one seems very similar to exposure, but it works to the artist’s benefit in a different way. Posting a video on Youtube of you playing your new song, and having it viewed by 100,000 people is exposure. Receiving 500 comments and emails is communication.

Why is it so important for an artist in the digital age to foster communication with his or her fans? Look at it this way: no matter how much a fan likes U2, Bono is never going to answer their email. James Hetfield is never going to add them on Myspace (his assistant might), and  the Members of Coldplay don’t follow them on Twitter. As a digital age artist you can do ALL of those things (and will if you know what’s good for you). If a fan want to know what a song is about, they can email you and expect a response. If someone wonders what software you record with, you are only one degree of separation away. True fans can bond with you, the artist, and know your work on a more personal level. You may never be a star, but you are famous to your true fans. As an artist, you can know your fans/listeners/readers on a first name basis. You can react to their feedback, give them what they want and make them a part of your creative process. For an artist to make a living from their art, communication is EVERYTHING.

A couple of scenarios that illustrate the point:

An artist has an idea for a graphic novel. She does some sketches with Photoshop using her Macbook and a Wacom drawing tablet. She posts them to an art forum where she gets critiques and makes changes based on the community feedback. Once she is comfortable with the work she sets up cheap hosting, buys a domain and installs WordPress and Comicpress to publish her work. She uses social networks to reach out to her potential audience and within 6 months 3000 people are reading her graphic novel every day. She publishes 3 pages a week and supports the site through a presale on the upcoming printed volume and advertising.
A songwriter records a full album (12 songs) using Garageband, an M-Audio USB sound card and a Midi controller (for drums, keys, strings, etc). He uploads the songs to Amazon S3 file hosting and links the Mp3‘s to a few music forums that he has been a part of for several years. The forum members post links on their blogs and word quickly spreads of his music. He also posts the full album on his website and Myspace page. He uses e-Junkie to sell the Mp3′s for $1 each. Eventually his songs (which are Creative Commons Licensed) are played on popular podcasts and internet radio stations. Eager fans flock to his site and purchase the songs, which are fairly prices and not restricted with DRM. He uses Eventful.com to decide where he should travel to play live shows. He stays in touch with his fans directly through email, his forum and comments on his blog. The fans feel a connection with the artist and support him through song sales, merchandise (physical CD’s and T-Shirts) and tickets to live performances.
These scenarios can be applied to podcasters, video bloggers, photographers, novelists, animators or pretty much any other creative profession you can think of. The barriers between a creative content producer and their potential audience are breaking down more and more every year. The best part is…

You do not have to be famous.

You don’t have to reach 100 million people to be a success. You don’t even need to reach 100,000. How many is the magic number, then? That depends on what you are creating and how much you are selling it for. Regardless of those two factors, would you agree to $100,000 would provide you a comfortable living as an artist? Considering what most artists earn from their art, you would probably be comfortable with considerably less than $100,000. Maybe $40K-$60K is your target comfort range

Assume that through your creative endeavors, which you offer up on the web through a combination of free handouts (free song a month, or free comic 3 times a week or a daily video blog) and paid content/merchandise (CD’s, T-Shirts, commissioned art, books, etc), you reach 10,000 people. We are talking 10,000 regular readers/listeners/whatever. This is NOT a very large number for the web. Popular podcasts like TWiT get 250,000+ listeners weekly and popular webcomics like PVP see daily visits between 100,000 and 200,000. So, trust me, you CAN get 10,000 casual followers. For the sake of our experiment, let’s say of your 10,000 fans, 10% are TRUE FANS.

What is a True Fan? A true fan is someone that holds your creative content near and dear. They feel a connection with your work and want to make sure you are capable of continuing to produce it. A True Fan will ACTUALLY SPEND MONEY on your content.

I’m not going into detail on how you should sell, market, or distribute your goods. There are other sources for that information. For the purpose of our experiment, I’m going to assume you are offering some kind of paid compensation opportunity to your True Fans.

So you have 1000 True Fans (for more info on the “1000 True Fans” concept, read up on Kevin Kelly), but what does that mean. A True Fan over the course of a year may spend anywhere from $50 to $100 on your creative content. That’s $50,000-100,000 annually before tax (a comfortable living for most). This is extremely simplified and your numbers may vary wildly but simplicity is key to getting the point across. With your art or music it may take 5000 True Fans spending $20 a year or 500 True Fans buying $200 original paintings, but the idea is the same. If you can truly connect with your die hard fans, those that would willingly pay for you to keep doing what you love to do, you CAN make a living from your creative output.

Again, the is extremely oversimplified and assumes you are producing quality content that people will want to digest. This experiment certainly won’t work for everyone. The flipside of the new information age is that in addition to YOU being able to get your content out to the masses, so can EVERYONE ELSE. The virtual market is flooded with wannabe webcomics, guitar heroes, videoblog divas and the like. You have to stand out through the quality of your art.

Wrapping up

We, as artists in the digital age, should not have to get permission from a record label, a book publisher or a worldwide media conglomerate to pursue our passion for a living. If our passions were customer service, management or accounting, we really wouldn’t have any problems. There are already very clear paths to achieve these goals and many people live very fulfilled lives that way. But what do those people do to relax? They listen to music, they watch movies, they read book and the look at silly comics on the internet. That’s where we come in. Artists create art so that others can enjoy it. We thrive on the creative process, and everyone else benefits from the result. Imagine how the quantity and quality of your artistic output would increase if creating it were your full time job.

Ask yourself, “Why can’t I draw comics for a living?” “Why can’t I play guitar and write songs to support myself?” “Why can’t I publish my own book, make a podcast or a produce TV show and still pay the bills?”

You absolutely can. We are the first generation of artists that DO NOT NEED PERMISSION to pursue our passion full time.","<em>The ""Digital Age"" Artist's Manifesto</em>",,,,2014-07-20T19:54:13+00:00,9,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/9,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=39,39,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T14:37:57+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,Digital Art,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/39

Abstract
Auriea Harvey and Michaël Samyn are new media artists who have embraced realtime 3D game technology as their artistic medium of choice. Realtime 3D is the most remarkable new creative technology since oil on canvas. It is much too important to be wasted on computer games alone. This manifesto is a call-to-arms for creative people (including, but not limited to, video game designers and fine artists) to embrace this new medium and start realizing its enormous potential. As well as a set of guidelines that express our own ideas and ideals about using the technology.

 1.  Realtime 3D is a medium for artistic expression.
 2.  Be an author.
 3.  Create a total experience.
 4.  Embed the user in the environment.
 5.  Reject dehumanisation: tell stories.
 6.  Interactivity wants to be free.
 7.  Don’t make modern art.
 8.  Reject conceptualism.
 9.  Embrace technology.
10. Develop a punk economy.

REALTIME ART MANIFESTO

1. Realtime 3D is a medium for artistic expression.
Games are not the only things you can make with realtime 3D technology.
And modification of commercial games is not the only option accessible to artists.
Realtime 3D is the most remarkable new creative technology since oil on canvas.
It is much too important to remain in the hands of toy makers and propaganda machines.
We need to rip the technology out of their greedy claws and put them to shame by producing
the most stunning art to grace this planet so far.
(And claim the name “game” for what we do even if it is inappropriate.)
Real-time 3d interactives can be an art form unto themselves.

2. Be an author.
Do not hide behind the freedom of the user in an interactive environment to ignore your responsibility as a creator.
This only ends in confirming cliches.
Do not design in board room meetings or give marketeers creative power.
Your work needs to come from a singular vision and be driven by a personal passion.
Do not delegate direction jobs.
Be a dictator.
But collaborate with artisans more skilled than you.
Ignore the critics and the fanboys.
Make work for your audience instead.
Embrace the ambiguity that the realtime medium excells in.
Leave interpretation open where appropriate
but keep the user focused and immersed the worlds that you create.
Commercial games are conservative, both in design as in mentality.
They eschew authorship, pretending to offer the player a neutral vessel to take him or her through the virtual world.
But the refusal to author results in a mimicing of generally accepted notions, of television and other mass media.
Banality.
Reject pure commercialism.
Individual elements of many commercial games made with craft and care produce artistic effects 
but the overall product is not art.
Some commercial games have artistic moments,
but we need to go further.
Step one: drop the requirement of making a game.
The game structure of rules and competition stands in the way of expressiveness.
Interactivity wants to be free.
Gaming stands in the way of playing.
There are so many other ways of interacting in virtual environments.
We have only just begun to discover the possibilities.
Games are games.
They are ancient forms of play that have their place in our societies.
But they are by far not the only things one can do with realtime technologies.
Stop making games.
Be an author.

3. Create a total experience.
Do not render!
All elements serve the realisation of the piece as a whole.
Models, textures, sound, interaction, environment, atmosphere, 
drama, story, programming 
are all equally important.
Do not rely on static renderings.
Everything happens in real time.
The visuals as well as the logic.
Create multi-sensorial experiences.
Simulate sensorial sensations for which output hardware does not exist (yet).
Make the experience feel real
(it does not need to look real).
Do not imitate other media but develop an aesthetic style that is unique.
Make the activity that the user spends most time doing the most interesting one in the game.
It’s not about the individual elements but about the total effect of the environment.
The sum of its parts.
In the end the work is judged by the quality of authorship
and not by its individual elements.
Models, textures, sound, interaction design, environment design, atmosphere, drama, story, programming.
Together without hierarchy.
No element can be singled out. All are equally important.
Create a simulated multi-sensorial experience. Not only a picture.
Or only a game.
Or only a soundtrack.

4. Embed the user in the environment.
The user is not disembodied in virtual space
but takes the body into the experience.
The avatar is not a neutral vessel but allows the user to navigate
not only through the virtual space
but also through the narrative content.
Interaction is the link between the user and the piece.
Provide for references
(both conceptual and sensorial)
to connect the user to the environment.
Reject abstraction.
Make the user feel at home.
(and then play with his
or her
expectations
-just don’t start with alienation,
the real world is alienationg enough as it is)
Reject the body-mind duality.
The user is the center of the experience.
Think “architecture”, not “film”.
Interaction is pivotal
to “put the user in the environment”.
The user is not disembodied but is provided with a device
(similar to a diving suit or astronout’s outfit)
which allows him
or her to visit a place that would otherwise not be accessible.
You bring your body with you to this place,
or at least your memories of it.
Strictly speaking, our output media only allow for the reproduction of visuals and sound.
But real-time interaction and processing can help us to achieve simulation of touch, smell and taste as well, through visuals and sound.
In fact, force feedback already provides for a way to communicate with touch.
And the activity of fingers on the mouse or hands holding a joystick allows for physical communication.
Don’t underestimate this connection.
From the USB port to the joystick. Through the hand to the nerous system.
One network.
Soon as smell and taste can be reproduced, those media can quickly be incorporated into our technology.
The virtual place is not necessarily alien.
On the contrary:
It can deal with any subject.
References to the real world
(of nature as well as culture)
(both conceptual and sensorial)
create links between the environment and the user.
Since interaction is pivotal, these links are crucial.
Make it feel real, not necessarily look real.
Develop a unique language for the realtime 3D medium and do not fall in MacLuhan’s trap (don’t allow any old medium to become the content of the new)
Imitate life and not photography, or drawings, or comic strips or even old-school games.
Realism does not equal photo -realism!
In a multisensory medium, realism is a multisensory experience: It has to feel real.

5. Reject dehumanisation: tell stories.
Stories ground people in culture,
(and remove the alienation that causes aggression)
stimulate their imagination,
(and therefore improve the capability to change)
teach them about themselves
and connect them with each other.
Stories are a vital element of society.
Embrace non-linearity.
Let go of the idea of plot.
Realtime is non-linear.
Tell the story through interaction.
Do not use in-game movies or other non-realtime devices to tell the story.
Do not create a “drama manager”: let go of plot!
Plot is not compatible with realtime.
Think “poetry”, not “prose”.
The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle recognized six elements in Drama.
PLOT
what happens in a play, the order of events,
is only one of them.
Next to plot we have
THEME
or the main idea in the work
CHARACTER
or the personality or role played by an actor
DICTION
the choice and delivery of words
MUSIC/RHYTHM
the sound, rhythm and melody of what is being said
SPECTACLE
the visual elements of the work.
All of these can be useful in non-linear realtime experiences. Except plot.
But the realtime medium offers additional elements that easily augment or replace plot.
INTERACTIVITY
the direct influence of the viewer on the work
IMMERSION
the presence of the viewer in the work
AN AUDIENCE OF ONE
every staging of the work is done for an audience of a single person in the privacy of his
or her home.
These new elements add the viewer as an active participant to the experience.
This is not a reduction of the idea of story but an enrichment.
Realtime media allow us to tell stories that could not be told before.
Many of the mythical fantasies about art can now be made real.
Now we can step into paintings and become part of them.
Now sculptures can come alive and talk to us.
Now we walk onto the stage and take part in the action.
We can live the lives of romance characters.
Be the poet or the muse.
Do not reject stortelling in realtime because it is not straightforward.
Realtime media allow us to make ambiguity and imagination active parts of the experience.
Embrace the ambiguity:
it is enriching.
The realtime medium allows for telling stories that cannot be told in any other language.
But realtime is not suitable for linear stories: Embrace non-linearity!
Reject plot!
Realtime is a poetic technology.
Populate the virtual world with narrative elements that allow the player to make up his or her own story.
Imagination moves the story into the user’s mind.
It allows the story to penetrate the surface and take its place amongst the user’s thoughts & memories.
The bulk of your story should be told in realtime, through interaction.
Do not use in-game movies or other devices.
Do not fall back on a machine to create plot on the fly: let go of plot, plot is not compatible with realtime.
Do not squeeze the realtime medium into a linear frame.
Stories in games are not impossible or irrelevant, even if “all that matters is gameplay”.
Humans need stories and will find stories in everything.
Use this to your advantage.
Yes, “all that matters is gameplay”,
if you extend gameplay to mean all interaction in the game.
Because it is through this interaction that the realtime medium will tell its stories.
The situation is the story.
Choose your characters and environment carefully
so that the situation immediately triggers narrative associations in the mind of the user.

6. Interactivity wants to be free.
Don’t make games.
The rule-based structure and competitive elements in traditional game design stand in the way of expressiveness.
And often, ironically, rules get in the way of playfulness
(playfulness is required for an artistic experience!).
Express yourself through interactivity.
Interactivity is the one unique element of the realtime medium.
The one thing that no other medium can do better.
It should be at the center of your creation.
Interactivity design rule number one:
the thing you do most in the game, should be the thing that is most interesting to do.
i.e., If it takes a long time to walk between puzzles, the walk should be more interesting than the puzzles.

7. Don’t make modern art.
Modern art tends to be ironical, cynical, self referential, afraid of beauty, afraid of meaning
-other than the trendy discourse of the day-,
afraid of technology, anti-artistry.
Furthermore contemporary art is a marginal niche.
The audience is elsewhere.
Go to them rather then expecting them to come to the museum.
Contemporary art is a style, a genre, a format.
Think!
Do not fear beauty.
Do not fear pleasure.
Make art-games, not game-art.
Game art is just modern art
-ironical, cynical, afraid of beauty, afraid of meaning.
It abuses a technology that has already spawned an art form capable of communicating far beyond the reach of modern art.
Made by artists far superior in artistry and skills.
Game art is slave art.
Realtime media are craving your input, your visions.
Real people are starving for meaningful experiences.
And what’s more:
society needs you.
Contemporary civilisations are declining at an unsurpassed rate.
Fundamentalism.
Fascism.
Populism.
War.
Pollution.
The world is collapsing while the Artists twiddle their thumbs in the museums.
Step into the world.
Into the private worlds of individuals.
Share your vision.
Connect.
Connect.
Communicate.

8. Reject conceptualism.
Make art for people,
not for documentation.
Make art to experience
and not to read about.
Use the language of your medium to communicate all there is to know.
The user should never be required to read a description or a manual.
Don’t parody things that are better than you.
Parodies of commercial games are ridiculous if their technology, craft and artistry do not match up with the original.
Don’t settle yourself in the position of the underdog: surpass them!
Go over their heads!
Dominate them!
Show them how it’s done!
Put the artistry back in Art.
Reject conceptualism.
Make art for people, not for documentation.
Make art to experience and not art to read about.
Use the language of your work to communicate its content.
The audience should never be required to read the description.
The work should communicate all that is required to understand it.

9. Embrace technology.
Don’t be afraid of technology,
and least of all, don’t make art about this fear.
It’s futile.
Technology is not nature. Technology is not god.
It’s a thing.
Made for people by people.
Grab it. Use it.
Software is infinitely reproducable and easy to distribute.
Reject the notion of scarcity.
Embrace the abundance that the digital allows for.
The uniqueness of realtime is in the experience.
Cut out the middle man: deliver your productions directly to the users.
Do not depend on galleries, museums, festivals or publishers.
Technology-based art should not be about technology:
it should be about life, death and the human condition.
Embrace technology, make it yours!
Use machines to make art for humans, not vice versa.
Make software!
Software is infinitely reproducable
(there is no original; uniqueness is not required
-the uniqueness is in the experience)
Distribution of software is easy through the internet or portable data containers
(no elitism; no museums, galleries, or festivals; from creator to audience without mediation -and from the audience back to the creator, through the same distribution media)

10. Develop a punk economy.
Don’t shy away from competition with commercial developers.
Your work offers something that theirs does not:
originality of design,
depth of content,
alternative aesthetics.
Don’t worry about the polish too much.
Get the big picture right.
“Reduce the volume, Increase the quality and density”
(Fumito Ueda)
Make short and intense games:
think haiku, not epic.
Think poetry, not prose.
Embrace punk aesthetics.
But don’t become too dependant on government or industry funding: it is unreliable.
Sell your work directly to your audience.
And use alternative distribution methods that do not require enormous sales figures to break even.
Consider self-publishing and digital distribution.
Avoid retail and traditional games publishers.
Together they take so great a cut
that it requires you to sell hundreds of thousands of copies to make your production investment back.
Do not allow institutional or economic control of your intellectual property, ideas, technology and inventions .
Don’t depend on government support or the arts world exclusively.
Sell your games!
Communicate with your audience directly:
cut out the middle man.
Let the audience support your work.
Communicate.

The ABC of Tactical Media
By David Garcia and Geert Lovink

Tactical Media are what happens when the cheap 'do it yourself' media, made possible by the revolution in consumer electronics and expanded forms of distribution (from public access cable to the internet) are exploited by groups and individuals who feel aggrieved by or excluded from the wider culture. Tactical media do not just report events, as they are never impartial they always participate and it is this that more than anything separates them from mainstream media.

A distinctive tactical ethic and aesthetic that has emerged, which is culturally influential from MTV through to recent video work made by artists. It began as a quick and dirty aesthetic although it is just another style it (at least in its camcorder form) has come to symbolize a verite for the 90's.

Tactical media are media of crisis, criticism and opposition. This is both the source their power, (""anger is an energy"" : John Lydon), and also their limitation. their typical heroes are; the activist, Nomadic media warriors, the pranxter, the hacker,the street rapper, the camcorder kamikaze, they are the happy negatives, always in search of an enemy. But once the enemy has been named and vanquished it is the tactical practitioner whose turn it is to fall into crisis. Then (despite their achievements) its easy to mock them, with catch phrases
of the right, ""politically correct"" ""Victim culture"" etc. More
theoretically the identity politics, media critiques and theories
of representation, that became the foundation of much western tactical media are themselves in crisis. These ways of thinking are widely seen as, carping and repressive remnants of an outmoded humanism.

To believe that issues of representation are now irrelevant is to believe that the very real life chances of groups and individuals are not still crucially affected by the available images circulating in any given society.  And the fact that we no longer see the mass media as the sole and centralized source of our self definitions might make these issues more slippery but that does not make them redundant.

Tactical media a qualified form of humanism. A useful antidote to both, what Peter Lamborn Wilson described, as  ""the unopposed rule of money over human beings"". But also as an antidote to newly emerging forms of technocratic scientism which under the banner of post-humanism tend to
restrict discussions of human use and social reception.

What makes Our Media Tactical? In 'The Practice of Every Day Life' De Certueau analyzed  popular culture not as a 'domain of texts or artifacts but rather as a set of practices or operations performed on textual or text like structures'. He shifted  the emphasis from representations in their own right to the  'uses' of representations. In other words how do we as  consumers use the texts and artifacts that surround us. And the answer, he suggested, was 'tactically'. That is in far more creative and rebellious ways than had previously been imagined. He described the process of consumption as a set of tactics by which the weak make use of the strong. He characterized the rebellious user (a term he preferred to
consumer) as tactical and the presumptuous producer (in which he included authors, educators, curators and revolutionaries) as strategic. Setting up this dichotomy allowed him to produce a vocabulary of tactics rich and
complex enough to amount to a distinctive and recognizable aesthetic. An existential aesthetic. An aesthetic of Poaching, tricking, reading, speaking, strolling, shopping, desiring. Clever tricks, the hunter's cunning, maneuvers, polymorphic situations, joyful discoveries, poetic as well as warlike.

Awareness of this tactical/strategic dichotomy helped us to name a class of producers of who seem uniquely aware of the value of these temporary reversals in the flow of power. And rather than resisting these rebellions do everything in their power to amplify them. And indeed make the creation of spaces, channels and platforms for these reversals central to their practice. We dubbed their (our) work tactical media.

Tactical Media are never perfect, always in becoming,
performative and pragmatic, involved in  a continual process of questioning the premises of the channels they  work with. This requires the confidence that the content can survive intact as it travels from interface to interface. But we must never forget that hybrid media has its opposite its nemesis, the Medialen Gesamtkunstwerk. The final program for the electronic Bauhaus.

Of course it is much safer to stick to the classic rituals of the
underground and alternative scene. Bu tactical media are based on a principal of flexible response, of working with different coalitions, being able to move between the different entities in the vast media landscape without betraying their original motivations. Tactical Media may be hedonistic, or zealously euphoric. Even fashion hypes have their uses. But it is above all mobility that most characterizes the tactical
practitioner. The desire and capability to combine or jump from one media to another creating a continuous supply of mutants and hybrids. To cross boarders, connecting and re-wiring a variety of disciplines and always taking full advantage of the free spaces in the media that are continually appearing because of the pace of technological change and regulatory uncertainty.

Although tactical media include alternative media,  we are not
restricted to that category. In fact we introduced the term tactical to disrupt and take us beyond the rigid dichotomies that have restricted thinking in this area, for so long,  dichotomies such as amateur Vs professional, alternative Vs mainstream. Even private Vs public.

Our hybrid forms are always provisional. What counts are the temporary connections you are able to make. Here and now, Not some vaporware promised for the future. But what we can do on the spot with the media we have access to. Here in Amsterdam we have access to local TV, digital cities and fortresses of new and old media. In other places they might
have theater, street demonstrations, experimental film, literature, photography.

Tactical media's mobility connects it to a wider movement of
migrant culture. Espousedby the proponents of what Nie
Ascherson described as the stimulating pseudo science of
Nomadism. 'The human race say its exponants are entering a new epoch of movement and migration. The subjects of history once the settled farmers and citizens, have become the migrants,the refugees the gastarbeiters, the asylum seekers, the urban homeless.'

An exemplery example of the tactical can be seen in the work of the Polish artist Krzystof Wodiczko who 'perceives how the
hordes of the displaced that now occupy the public space of cities squares,  parks or railway station concourses which were once designed by a triumphant middle class to celebrate the conquest of its new political rights and economic liberties. Wodiczko thinks that these  occupied spaces form new agoras. which should be used for statements. 'The artist', he says, 'needs to learn how to operate as a nomadic sophist in a migrant polis.'

Like other migrant media tactitions Wodiczko has studied the
techniques by which the weak become stronger than the opressors by scatering , by becoming centreless, by moving fast across the physical or media and virtual landscapes. 'The hunted mustdiscover the ways become the hunter.'

But capital is also radically deterritorialized. This is why we like being based in a building like De Waag, an old fortress in the center of Amsterdam. We happily accept the paradox of *centers* of tactical media. As well as castles in the air, we need fortresses of bricks and mortar, to resist a world of unconstrained nomadic capital. Spaces to plan not just improvise and the possibility of capitalizing on
acquired advantages, has always been the preserve of 'strategic' media. As flexible media tacticians, who are not afraid of power, we are happy to adopt this approach ourselves.

Every few years we do a Next 5 Minutes conference on tactical media from around the world. Finally we have a base (De Waag) from which we hope to consolidate and build for the longer term. We see this building as a place to plan regular events and meetings, including coming The Next 5 Minutes. We see the coming The Next 5 Minutes (in january 1999), and
discussions leading up to it, as part of a movement to create an antidote to what Peter Lamborn Wilson described, as 'the unopposed rule of money over human beings.'

In the beginning was the Ad. The Ad was brought to the consumer by the Advertiser. Desire, self worth, self image, ambition, hope; all find their genesis in the Ad. Through the Ad and the intent of the Advertiser we form our ideas and learn the myths that make us into what we are as a people. That this method of self definition displaced the earlier methods is beyond debate. It is now clear that the Ad holds the most esteemed position in our cosmology.
Advertising suffuses all corners of our waking lives; it so permeates our consciousness that even our dreams are often indistinguishable from a rapid succession of TV commercials. 

Different forms of media serve the Ad as primary conduits to the people. Entirely new media have been invented solely to streamline the process of bringing the Ad to the people. 

Old fashioned notions about art, science and spirituality being the peak achievements and the noblest goals of the spirit of man have been dashed on the crystalline shores of Acquisition; the holy pursuit of consumer goods. All old forms and philosophies have been cleverly co-opted and re""spun"" as marketing strategies and consumer campaigns by the new shamans, the Ad men. 

Spiritualism, literature and the physical arts: painting, sculpture, music and dance are by and large produced, packaged and consumed in the same fashion as a new car. Product contents, dictated by trends in hipness, contain a half-life matching the producers calender for being supplanted by newer models. 

Product placement in television and film have overtaken story line, character development and other dated strategies in importance in the agendas of the filmmakers. The directors commanding the biggest budgets have more often than not cut their teeth on TV Ads & music videos. 

Artists are judged and rewarded on the basis of their relative standing in the ongoing commodification of art objects. Bowing to fashion and the vagaries of gallery culture, these creators attempt to manufacture collectible baubles and contemporary or ""period"" objects that will successfully penetrate the collectors market. The most successful artists are those who can most successfully sell their art. With increasing frequency they apprentice to the Advertisers; no longer needing to falsely maintain the distinction between ""Fine"" & ""Commercial"" art. 

And so we see, the Ad defines our world, creating both the focus on ""image"" and the culture of consumption that ultimately attract and inspire all individuals desirous of communicating to their fellow man in a profound fashion. It is clear that He who controls the Ad speaks with the voice of our Age. 

You can switch off/smash/shoot/hack or in other ways avoid Television, Computers and Radio. You are not compelled to buy magazines or subscribe to newspapers. You can sic your rotweiler on door to door salesman. Of all the types of media used to disseminate the Ad there is only one which is entirely inescapable to all but the bedridden shut-in or the Thoreauian misanthrope. We speak, of course of the Billboard. Along with its lesser cousins, advertising posters and ""bullet"" outdoor graphics, the Billboard is ubiquitous and inescapable to anyone who moves through our world. Everyone knows the Billboard; the Billboard is in everyones mind. 

For these reasons the Billboard Liberation Front states emphatically and for all time herein that to Advertise is to Exist. To Exist is to Advertise. Our ultimate goal is nothing short of a personal and singular Billboard for each citizen. Until that glorious day for global communications when every man, woman and child can scream at or sing to the world in 100Pt. type from their very own rooftop; until that day we will continue to do all in our power to encourage the masses to use any means possible to commandeer the existing media and to alter it to their own design. 

Each time you change the Advertising message in your own mind, whether you climb up onto the board and physically change the original copy and graphics or not, each time you improve the message, you enter in to the High Priesthood of Advertisers.

By proposing a 'network of castles,' Wilson theorizes the production of autonomous digital spaces that might foment the tactical media ethic and aesthetic.",,,EN,,,,"First distributed via <a href=""http://www.nettime.com"">www.nettime.com</a>",,,"<a href=""http://subsol.c3.hu/subsol_2/contributors2/plwilsontext.html"">http://subsol.c3.hu/subsol_2/contributors2/plwilsontext.html</a>","Tactical Media, Internet Freedom","RESPONSE TO THE TACTICAL MEDIA MANIFESTO: 
A NETWORK OF CASTLES

Peter Lamborn Wilson 


Tactical media, then, would be a kind of filth--an organic process--as compared with the ideological cleanliness of strategic media (the ""author"").

Do we need a defense of filth, or a theory of filth--as fertility, as pleasure, as relaxation from the rigidities of ""Civilization""? Not nostalgia for the mud, but the mud itself ? Or would such theorizing simply become another kind of tidying-up process--an erasure of its own theoretical object?

The tactical problem consists of the need (or desire) to stay ahead of representation --not just to escape it, but to attain through mobilization a relative invulnerability from to representation. And the problematic aspect of the problem is that all media--even tactical media--deal in representation.

Thus one can follow the trajectory of a given tactical medium, through ever greater representation, towards the fate of being subsumed into some strategy. And the fatal black hole toward which so many of these trajectories vanish is Capital--of course.

Everything is a process of being cleaned up. To preserve its autonomy the tactical medium wants to remain dirty--it can never let itself be surrounded and cleared by strategy, by ideology. It must stay out ahead, drifting before all possible waves, uncertain even of its own trajectory.

By another paradox, this uncertainty itself becomes a ""principle."" It comes to occupy the space of a strategy--and thus to define a strategic space. No ""authors"" need to be implicated. A messy organic process--involving both reason and unreason--not imposed or categorical--emergent. Shape-shifting. Dangerous and plagued by failures. But not aimless or undirected. In effect--strategic.

Media as technologies (""machines"") are perfect mirror-representations of the totality that produces them (or vice-versa). The internet, for example, mirrors not only its military origin but also its affinity with Capital. Like globalism, it breaks through borders--it is a ""chaos,"" like Capital (which seeks the Strange Attractor of the numisphere, where the numinous and the numismatic are one and eternal). One might even speak of ""nomadic"" features (""migratory capital""). Like Capital, the Net is drawn toward virtuality, cognitive prosthesis, disembodiment. But (the ""vice versa"" process) media tend simultaneously toward the production of the totality:--a complex multi-feedback relation.

In one sense, tactical media would then have to engage in the destruction and/or subversion (""substruction"") of this complex--driving a wedge between the machine and the totality. Such action would imply that the totality is far from total, that there will be interruptions along the feedback lines, breaks in ""service""--missing zones, and zones of resistance.

Ad-hoc, constantly mutating, determinedly empirical, at this point tactics begin to coalesce into a strategy (""spontaneous ordering""). Because this strategy has no ""author"" (and is not ideologically driven) each tactical medium--each tactician as medium--will be able to seek direction from it without losing autonomy to it. Thus the complex interplay between tactic and strategy is one of mutual validation or ""co-emergence.""

At this point, the metaphor of the castle--introduced by the Manifesto--takes on an added luster, or perhaps a baleful gleam. The Nizari Ismailis (the so-called ""Assassins"") structured their polity around a network of remote castles, most of which were inaccessible to every medieval military tactic--even prolonged siege, since they were supplied with their own gardens and water. Each high castle typically protected a fertile valley and was therefore self-sufficient--but full communication and even economic activity could take place within the network thanks to the ""porosity"" of medieval borders. And thanks to the policy of assassination or threatened assassinations, kings and religious authorities hesitated to interfere. This went on for centuries.

Some years ago I remarked that the Nizari model for utopia had been rendered impossible by modern technologies of war and communication. Perhaps it would be interesting as a thought-experiment to see if this negative judgment still holds true. From a military viewpoint of course it does--the ""isolated castle"" (or commune or the like) can still be eliminated by the push of a button. But ""the military"" must have a reason for such action. Since ""assassination"" is an absurdity (e.g. the Unabomber)--and even ""militance"" must be re-defined--there may be no immediately apparent reason for the military to suppress a given ""autonomous zone.""

The question of communication technology is trivial by comparison, but interesting. The Net as a ""military"" structure is ""accessible to all,"" and even as Capital absorbs the Net these tactical areas of indeterminacy persist--the same holds true for all ""intimate"" or tactical media. Thus the ""network of castles"" becomes possible--but the real question is whether the castle itself is possible.

Like any institution the castle will exist in part as a representation of itself in media. The Assassins' castles were rooted partly in the imaginaire, in the image that pervaded medieval media (text, work-of-mouth, legend), in the image of mysterious inaccessibility and danger. The Mongols finally destroyed Alamut not by direct assault but by demoralizing it with an even more fearsome image (pyramids of skulls from China to Hungary, etc.). But at its height of power, Alamut could dispense even with assassination, since the image alone sufficed to ward off all military and political attention.

Under the regime of global neo-liberalization or pan-capitalism that triumphed in 1989, the nation-states of the world have begun to ""privatize"" all social functions for the collection of taxes for the support of military and police force, and the use of that force in the interests of Capital. The ""natural law of the free market,"" however, clashes with the remnants of social ideology embedded in such structures as the UN, the EU, or even the ""old"" liberal or conservative regimes of certain states. Politics in such situations becomes a matter cognitive dissonance.

This is exacerbated by the appearance of ""new media"" which mirror the global totality but also enhance the cognitive dissonance (negative feedback, ""noise"") inherent in the representations of the totality. Capital seems to have a logic of its own--the tendency of money to define all human relations, if you will--but in truth neither capitalists nor politicians can really penetrate this logic or understand its direction--much less control it. Huge conceptual gaps open in the structure of the ""totality."" The question remains: are these gaps strategic?

The gaps cut across sedimentary layers of actuality, and the gaps themselves tend to shift position, change shape, open and close. Geography as well as the virtual space of the image, space as well as time constitute the mutating forms of these potential tactical regions. some will be zones of depletion, in which all power has been shut off (there are rumors of strange tribes around Chernobyl...); others will be accidental autonomous zones which might involve classes, groups (""refugees"") or specific areas. Some will be liberratd zones (Chiapas), others will be deliberate seams. Some will be ""unseen,"" others will enter into representation. In the midst of such fluidity, there must emerge some islands or rocks. Castles will be occupied in the confusion, and later there will be no military advantage in destroying them. The castles will not be defendable, but they will be irrelevant, unassimilable--to ""remote"" (even in the middle of ancient cities)--apparently pointless. An air of shabby eccentricity might be useful here.

Another reason for Alamut's success was that any king who allowed it to exist could consider the possibility of a secret alliance, whereby money could be used to purchase immunity from the dagger--or perhaps even a contract on some other king--or most interesting of all, access to the secret sciences (astronomy, engineering and hydraulics, political philosophy, medicine, yogic techniques, etc.) of the Nizari observatories and libraries. In modern terms we might say that capitalists and politicians are so confused and ignorant about new media (far more so than the average artist or 14-year-old) that large sums of money are currently being spent on ""secret sciences."" Out of the conflict between Capital and State over monopolies of representation, gaps can be produced--and made big enough to contain castles.

All this of course remains on the level of tactics. But the construction of a ""network of castles"" would constitute not only (in itself) a pleasurable act of autonomy and self-organization, but also a ""strategic"" structure, or rather an organic and embodied complexity out of which a strategic dimension might well emerge.

I was inspired by some of those manifestos of other artists and thought I might give it a try.

Art Manifesto

1. Art is a language, it must be written in words. The reason there are no more art movements is because there are no more languages. Post Modernism destroyed them all.

Languages are born out of pattern, recognition, reproduction, and memory. 

Without memory we can never improve, change, evolve, grow, or sustain what we value.

2. Time is a natural resource. It is an artist’s air. We sell our air just to survive and then everybody wonders why all the artists are holding their breath. 

3. Art is freedom. It needs freedom like plants need water and sunlight. It can exist with less freedom as a deformed and stunted plant continues to exist. 

4. Freedom lives in two dimensions; one in the real world, and the other in our minds. One is the unlocking of a gate, and the other is knowing the gate is unlocked.

5. Most of the world’s greatest masterpieces were never created. They fail to escape the mind who first conceives them.

6. Civilization can survive without Art, it has and still does in many places. It isn’t society but the soul that falls apart without it.

7. Art can and does serve the wealthy and powerful. Only we decide when it deserves better.

8. A true Artist is open minded to everything, he listens then interprets accordingly.

9. There is such a thing as bad art, it is exists in the absence of thought, inspiration, imagination and vision. Good Artists are aware of these forces, great Artists possess them, and masters weald them.

Good art touches something that others try to access through it. It is the marriage of the intellect and the emotions.

10. An Artist must farm their imagination to strengthen their creativity. One can gain or lose creative power depending on one’s habits.

11. A strong imagination is limitless, it feels like an ocean of possibilities. The artist’s conception is the wind that carves and molds these troubled water.

12. An artist’s tools disappear every time he steps into a new media. We begin using them without knowing how they work let alone that they exist. With every new creation the tools become a little clearer. With every new media, our old tools change.

13. an Artist knows when art is being truthful. Unauthentic art exudes a lofting, almost undetected- funny smell.

14. Living in constant inspiration is the goal of any Artist lucky enough to have experienced it before.

15. Artists cannot fit into social conventions- when they do, they cease being Artists. This transition is reversible.

16. A true Artist is not economical, he pours into his work every detail he hopes others will pull out of it. There are no short cuts to a master piece. 

17. obfuscation is not a style. It fills the white space within a young Artist’s work, and helps distract the teacher from seeing these empty spaces.

18. Artists don’t see what exists, we bring what doesn’t yet exist… into this world.",<em>Art Manifesto</em>,,,,2014-07-22T02:52:10+00:00,9,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/9,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=45,45,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T14:33:52+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Digital Art, Tactical Media",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/45

A group of journalists, bloggers, professionals and creators want to express their firm opposition to the inclusion in a Draft Law of some changes to Spanish laws restricting the freedoms of expression, information and access to culture on the Internet. They also declare that:

1.- Copyright should not be placed above citizens’ fundamental rights to privacy, security, presumption of innocence, effective judicial protection and freedom of expression.

2.- Suspension of fundamental rights is and must remain an exclusive competence of judges. This blueprint, contrary to the provisions of Article 20.5 of the Spanish Constitution, places in the hands of the executive the power to keep Spanish citizens from accessing certain websites.

3.- The proposed laws would create legal uncertainty across Spanish IT companies, damaging one of the few areas of development and future of our economy, hindering the creation of startups, introducing barriers to competition and slowing down its international projection.

4.- The proposed laws threaten creativity and hinder cultural development. The Internet and new technologies have democratized the creation and publication of all types of content, which no longer depends on an old small industry but on multiple and different sources.

5.- Authors, like all workers, are entitled to live out of their creative ideas, business models and activities linked to their creations. Trying to hold an obsolete industry with legislative changes is neither fair nor realistic. If their business model was based on controlling copies of any creation and this is not possible any more on the Internet, they should look for a new business model.

6.- We believe that cultural industries need modern, effective, credible and affordable alternatives to survive. They also need to adapt to new social practices.

7.- The Internet should be free and not have any interference from groups that seek to perpetuate obsolete business models and stop the free flow of human knowledge.

8.- We ask the Government to guarantee net neutrality in Spain, as it will act as a framework in which a sustainable economy may develop.

9.- We propose a real reform of intellectual property rights in order to ensure a society of knowledge, promote the public domain and limit abuses from copyright organizations.

10.- In a democracy, laws and their amendments should only be adopted after a timely public debate and consultation with all involved parties. Legislative changes affecting fundamental rights can only be made in a Constitutional law.

wearable computing, retinal displays, distributed wireless mesh networks and semantic web standards are the foundation of an outside internet. The space, the social network, thinking tools and the network interface in the same field of view. The boundaries between what is interior and what is exterior intersecting tangibly in front of your eyes.

It has been said that 80 percent of human knowledge has a spa­tial aspect – yet at the same time the Internet has largely ignored this. We are human beings; embedded in and subservient to the spatial and temporal limitations of a physical reality. The Internet should soon be able to reflect these realities better.

background

The headmap manifesto is a sequence of text fragments dealing with the social and cultural implications of location aware devices.

Headmap argues a move from the ‘inside’ view that developed after the failure of the space programme, the closure of the fron­tiers, the rise of television, early computing, interiorised simulation and drug culture..

..towards an ‘outside’ view – a recolonisation of the real world, computers becoming invisible, mobile, networked and location aware, the real world augmented rather than simulated. People finding more outside than inside and developing sophisticated information based relationships to exterior spaces, computer games moving outside, technologies facilitating the tagging and annotating of spaces, places, people, animals and things, the emergence of new forms of spontaneous externalised real social interaction, constructs drawn from dreams and myth shape the outside more tangibly than ever before.

New forms of collective, network organised dissent are emerging. Collectively constructive rather than oppositional. Now capable of augmenting, reorganising, and colonising real spaces without altering what is already there or notifying those being colonised.

The internet has already started leaking into the real world. Head­map argues that when it gets trully loose the world will be new again.

the geomesh

a geomesh

Presence on a local wireless network is becoming a usable indica­tor of spatial proximity (for machines and people). GPS systems can supplement this less formal geocentric interaction by provid­ing accurate information that can be disseminated through the local network (but they don’t necessarily need to).

wireless nodes can broadcast RDF feeds containing location infor­mation [cf consume]

wireless heavy conferences are early forms of working social geo­meshes, the location of participants is constrained and a wireless communication channel is open. The geosocial organising prin­ciple is the intersection of the conference (representing both place and common interest) and wireless network, if you’re associated at the conference and on the network you’re most likely connected spatially, socially and ontologically.

new world

The linking of a location aware device (e.g. something with GPS funtionality), with a handheld com­puter (e.g. an IPAQ or a handspring) together with a mobile, wireless, internet connection, creates a significant new mass market computing platform which begins to make possible:

• leaving notes, demarcating spaces, and marking places, but leaving no external visible sign of having done so.

• anything left can be made visible to all, or to user specified indi­viduals and groups.

• information (textual, audible or visual) can be bound to specific places.

• an alternative or supplement to permanent visual signifiers (e.g. signs, clothing, advertising).

• individuals can utilise new forms of community based on aug­mented awareness of their proximity to places of interest and each other..

..spontaneous extended community defined by both common interest and proximity.

• tracking the migration and movement patterns of people, ani­mals and things.

• places can have histories ‘attached’ to them (i.e. the collection of notes left at a given place sorted according to when they were left).

• inanimate objects can become more animate (if you know where

 

a tree is and you know when someone is walking past it you could make it burst into song).

inertial navigation

..there are even Integrated MicroElectrical Mechanical Systems (IMEMS) techniques which are making possible the fabrication of chips with onboard digital compasses, and, more interestingly, gyroscopes and accelerometers (which means that the kind of inertial navigation systems used to navigate nuclear submarines without breaking radio silence can be embedded inside your cell phone)

Location aware devices.

street lights functioning as wireless mesh network nodes

“As cable companies continue to increase the cost of broadband service, and as telcom monopolies are strengthened by changes in FCC policy, it is now absolutely clear what the broadband endgame will be in the US: wireless. Think of a city where every single street light is a node in a mesh (for an example, see meshnetworks), and thus where the cloud of the internet sits on the street like the fog in San Francisco. For almost nothing, cities could provide IP light, as cities provide street lights. Neutral, end-to-end, fast, and cheap.”

location aware devices

location aware, networked, mobile devices make pos­sible invisible notes attached to spaces, places, people and things.

the headmap manifesto articulates the social implications of loca­tion aware devices.

It manifests a world in which computer games move outside and get subversive.

Sex and even love are easier to find.

Real space can be marked and demarcated invisibly.

..what was once the sole preserve of builders, architects and engi­neers falls into the hands of everyone: the ability to shape and organise the real world and the real space.

Real borders, boundaries and space become plastic and male­able, statehood becomes fragmented and global..

Geography gets interesting

Cell phones become internet enabled and location aware, everything in the real world gets tracked, tagged, barcoded and mapped.

Overlaying everything is a whole new invisible layer of annota­tion. Textual, visual and audible information is available as you get close, as context dictates, or when you ask.

internal models

The blurring of the boundaries between interior and exterior, the real and the virtual, foreshadows the formal acknowledgment of the space at the intersection and the extent to which that intersec­tion can now be tangibly manifested and manipulated.

internal models are slipping out into the world like agile, colourful, and communicative ghosts. The same ghosts of our intent that traditionally emerged heavy and quiet in concrete and steel, or just as agile as their modern counterparts, but bound to paper and travelling slow and disconnected.

no need to stop and look at the map, the map overlaid on the space, and in the same field of view, will no longer be separable from the space.

..assumptions etched on our eyes

plasticity

In the sixties mathematics was animated in your head or in mechanical forms, heavy metal and concrete and steel were marveled at for there combined plasticity and the speed with which a building made of them could be conceived of and built

the more we integrate agile and manipulable externalised maps with our normal field of view, the more exposed the connection between the internal and the external becomes.

there is a more tangible sense of the interaction between internal maps and external reality

we will no longer ‘stop to look at the map’ reinforcing the split between interior and exterior, the map and the territory will be tangibly integrated in our field of view

as without so within

intersections

a headmap is bound up with the feedback loop when something internal is externalised, seen simultaneously in the context of external reality, manipulated in that context, and reinternalised

evidence of the intersection between outside and inside [real and virtual], the formal acknowledgement that something outside came from inside

until recently world and brain, physical and mental [mind and body], have been easy to see as split instead of intersected

is it real or is it virtual is the wrong question

Technology is rapidly facilitating the externalising of the interior journey of the last 30 years [drugs, computing, electronic media, network culture]

temporaryness and maleability makes internal outside more

 

apparent..

..a building is less obviously externalised interior because of its permanence and imovability

..from magick, ritual, mathematics, logic, tarot, mnemonic archi­tecture and theatre, drugs, maps, books and songlines

..to tinderboxes, gps, mesh networks, shimmering mnemonic architecture and theatre, drugs, networks, magickal suggestion, temporary and spontaneous culture and unlearning

we are beginning to see agile manifestations of our internal models moving and tangible in front of our eyes ..pliable and manipulable them, change them and take it back inside.

chemical maps, digital maps, architectural maps, narrative maps, symbolic maps, scientific maps, psychological maps, economic maps, social maps, diaries, learning maps, future maps

a road is a real thing, but it emerged from human intent (whether carved out by thousands of feet or forced through by civil engi­neers. Its origins are internal and its manifestation is a practical reality.

what was inside projected outside, something coming from inside clarified outside, an external manifestation that now acts on our interior model of what real is

theatre is a map that triggers meaning, as is archi­tecture, as are books and computer screens and social networks

..drugs are a projection of personal decon­struction, and the capacity of drugs to alter our experience of and response to reality is bound into the possibilities of wearable technology

so many possibilities are close to the surface, real­ity is tangibly collective collaborative experimental modern fiction

nodishness and spatialness

[ambient calculus for humans]

nodishness is about the boundary between the personal and the collective

..the boundary between personal extension of self and the collec­tive interconnected extension of us

noone is an island and noone isn’t

you preserve extended personal boundaries and don’t exist alone

…pushing the limits of seperatenss and dynamic connectedness

adhoc-corporate but still cellular

we had a network of static machines and moving people ..now a significant part of the machine network is moving as well – moving personal devices attached to people

you, your mobile device your weblog

but all these chosen personal extensions are designed and opti­mised to exist in a network of similars

..pushing chosen perceptible boundaries that are permeable, open, and connected

with technologies like rendezvous and open 802.11 nodes emerg­ing from broadband + wireless you’re not the edge anymore, you’re the way out for someone if you find the way out

..or just a source of interesting mp3’s while you’re in the same space

there is a layer of the network which is now dynamic, adhoc, impromptu and moving

and to that layer, proximity and spatial isssues are important. While we are reliant on radio transmitters and current technol­ogy, it matters how far, and whats in the way ..and because we’re moving we want to know about where we are and we want to find cool stuff here real or informational

analysis of the interrelations between weblogs shows people accepting and understanding their nodish fate in ever greater numbers. Linking in every direction and accepting links from every direction in a link economy.

eliminating the distance between the physical self and the digital identity will result in other forms of exchange beyond links

blogs are still stuck things

no reason why your network identity should be stuck so far from your physical identity

its one thing to attach geographical coordinates to a blog

but why not just go the whole way and have an abstract interface to your personal self beyond your clothes and how good your breath smells

in spatial terms, you’re already going to be walking around with ports essentially visible (whether open or closed). When someone electronically sniffs the air in the room you happ en to be in they see your devices whether you let them access them or not.

you’re not far from having to consciously think about the electronic signature you’re giving off

its likely to end up being something more than nokia or sony

..what kind of nodishness do you aspire to

whats your interface like ?

the physical distance between you and your digital identity is likely to decrease very rapidly

the pure abstaction of the internet is very attractive but the plain fact is that we are active parts of the network and essentially earth bound spatially orientated beings. Instead of disappearing into the world of bits anytime soon the world of bits is going to have to come out into the world.

..really it goes both ways, as we accept our fate and get on with

being mobile nodes

people are nodish in themselves: bounded but connected..

weblogs are personal spaces with nodish qualities..

Mobile devices are very personal devices, and nodish, the prolifer­ation of 802.11 and bluetooth built into these devices make mobile users walking infrastructure for mobile adhoc networks

“Mobile adhoc networking allows users to exchange information in a wireless environment without the need for a fixed infrastruc­ture. Each user (or node), equipped with one or more radios, is free to roam about while communicating with others. The path between any pair of users can traverse multiple wireless links and the radios themselves can be heterogeneous, thus enabling an assortment of different types of links to be part of the same adhoc network.” [from a mobile mesh website]

mobile adhoc networking technologies (like apple’s Rendezvous) are realising and resulting in personal impromptu networks, some­times connecting to wider networks, sometimes just to the people and devices in a particular room (maybe just sharing music or collaboratively working on hydra headed documents).

People: aware, processing, recording, disconnecting, moving, searching, connecting and retransmitting in collusion with their devices

more and more we (bound to our devices) are mobile nodes.

extended but bounded personal spaces existing in and facilitating networked spaces

external human interaction is more and more through this extended concrete and abstract personal space

nodishness

more and more, because of these concrete personal devices and these abstract blogish applications. You, extended you, but still you a bounded personal space (you a human.device.blog node) constitute a new thing walking the earth, traversing and creating

“The Internet has been at the forefront of the industry’s efforts for the past decade, but from a paradigmatic point of view, it was largely framed as an add-on to a personal computer. But now a personal computer is becoming part of a larger mesh of comput­ers and devices that come and go, with a mesh of services that come and go, and application design is starting to reflect that realization. With Rendezvous, Apple has come up with a very, very simple architecture that I can see a lot of people leveraging.” Tim O’Reilly

nodishness mixed with spatialness

headmaps and smartmobs

the internet is a collective, heaving, ever changing map already, with everyone contributing a bit of what they can see.

..theres a linux quote that i can’t find that says something like using linux is like living in a house thats always being worked on, you wake up in the morning to find that someones built a really cool extension out the back while you were asleep.

..an extensible metaphor that actually applies to the reality of the real world in general: really cool or really bad, you can bet some­one built something while you were sleeping.

adding a spatial or geographical dimension to the internet is a natural and ongoing extension in the light of increased mobility and wirelessness.

but the result is that metaphors start slipping in all directions..

maps becoming a persistent visible feature of the place they happen to map.. so that you need to mark the maps on the map or you won’t see the place properly

Devices are aware (and becoming more so) of location, of people, of messages, of connectivity and other machines. The users handle the other half of the awareness. ..and they all rely on each other.

It follows from increased mobility that the benefits and possibilities that arise from formally tagging information with place references become apparent.

location aware emergence

7 fairly obvious spatial/network capabilities that are already maturing and readilly available.

1). using mobiles to coordinate people in the same space you cannot see e.g. “i’m in the carpark, where are you?” or using texting to coordinate antiglobalisation demonstrations (smartmobs).

2). personal diaries for recording and sharing experience (blogs) extending to mobile devices. Mobblogging (mobile blogging) with picture phones, handhelds and laptops. Mobile Phones have only recently become ‘one to many devices’, you can now text to a group or send a photo straight to a web page.

3). Finding out how to get where from where you are to where you need to be is easy using webmapping tools like streetmap and mapquest. These tools have mobile interfaces so you can use them from a phone or handheld.

4). web accessible databases of place information (restaurants or whatever), are already being used by mobile users through services like Vindigo and Yell. You don’t use GPS, you just enter a cross street or the local post code of where you are to find some­thing close by.

5). Projects like Geourl are allowing bloggers to add tags to there web pages, that locate the blog in a particular place. This locates the conversations of bloggers. Paris bloggers, NYC bloggers, London bloggers. Tagging projects allow for adding location as a property to all kinds of web accessible information. UpMyStreet specialises in spatially locating conversations.

6). In car navigation systems are also becoming more common and even skeptics end up finding them really useful. GPS units can be bought for cheap, and are slowly being integrated into chips and phones and handhelds.

 

7). Because bluetooth and 802.11 allow local machines to talk to each other, if one of the machines knows where it is, they all can, and location information can be stored locally

Integrating all these capabilities gives you something new. Net­works and shared information about places without a centralised mediator.

connect and integrate all this extant thinking and given the gen­eral trend towards nodishness you are going to get considerable spatial weirdness emerging.

The longer term possibilities are new forms of exchange, coopera­tion, spontaneous governance, fluid digital architecture overlaying real space (marking, connecting, bounding, guiding, and illustrat­ing places), contextual computing, spontaneous interfaces to groups and spaces (people, playgrounds and tower blocks).

all increasingly possible (to the point of banality)

There’s never been a clearer, more real and open, or more inter­esting opportunity to try to discern the patterns of, and then to pro­vide maps, systems, models and prototypes for future community.

You will be able to ask the question who is my ‘closest friend’ and get a numerical answer and a position.

social software and spatial interfaces

localis(z)ation

essential interfaces

There is a lack of essential interfaces to 20th century ‘machines for living in’ (housing projects and urban environments)..

Interfaces to local communities and local spaces are finally evolv­ing after an extended period during which the development of communications technologies has focused on making proximity irrelevant. (global rather than local ..when does the next bus get here?)

- interfaces attached to buildings and empty spaces (for making better use of community spaces, sports fields, playgrounds etc).

- interfaces based on new opportunities for sharing and exchange (digital spatialised mediation of simultaneous need).

digital objects and creatures

digital ‘objects’ and ‘creatures’ attached to locations and spaces.

different meanings

Different people attach different meanings to the same space. Location aware devices make it possible to externalise these different views, make them tangible and share and extend them. (use the collective local cycle courier view of an urban space to find a short cut in an unfamiliar city).

invisible architecture

Location aware devices make possible: leaving notes, demarcat­ing spaces, and marking places, but leaving no external visible sign of having done so.

This lays the foundation for a new subjective, invisible, instant architecture (new paths, new places).

seeing the space differently

Location aware devices will remove the inertia, the objective real­ity claim, and the stabilising influence of the built environment.

Location aware devices allow individuals and communities to see the space differently.

Society will continue to fragment as the once shared meaning of the built environment migrates into many dif­ferent collective (subjective and invisible) views of the space (mediated by location aware devices).

Despite this new architecture being effectively invisible, the appar­ently out of context or ‘out of place’ human behaviour that will result will not be invisible.

Seeing the space differently may lead to radical social and politi­cal upheaval (the German ‘blitzkrieg’ was a consequence of a new spatial doctrine).

counter culture precedent

Counter-culture spatial and social exploration since the 1960’s prefigures the opportunities for spatial and social reorganisation offered by location aware devices (temporary autonomous zones, the hippy trail, communal living, extra-geographical allegiances, collective construction, externalised word of mouth, new ideas about value and exchange).

localisation

“Space will change. Localization may happen. The US may run out of cheap petroleum eventually.” Lawrence Angrave

Location aware devices make it possible to better leverage the space around you. To better integrate awareness of proximity into the extended communities (usually based on common interest rather than proximity) that have grown up around space folding technologies like the telephone and the internet.

 

This represents a technologically inspired interest in, and move towards, localisation.

spatial and social exploration

get free of the ‘line of sight’ labyrinth of streets and buildings

organise, augment and alter real spaces (add shapes, community and information to them)

drive cars that aren’t yours and live in houses you don’t live in

pay with what you have (even when you don’t have money)

ask for what you want, or, how you can help, and walk to where the answer is

phone the things you own (ask your keys where they are)

find the people you need to find

community and spatial inter­faces [soft architecture]

community and spatial interfaces

“There is as yet no new social framework that is as interesting as technology, and ideas, now allow.”

There are new ways to organise, make sense of, and leverage, local spaces and local communities.

New interfaces to the real spaces that people move through and live in are now possible. Technology is creating an opportunity for communications to become less mediated rather than more medi­ated, to get people outside and increase rather than decrease real face to face communication.

spatialising despatialised communities

dislocating:

The internet lowered barriers to long distance communications and made distance and time independent community a real pos­sibility for anyone with an internet connection.

The cell phone, pagers, email, fax machines, video conferencing, web sites, all enable us to conduct life efficiently at a distance from each other.

Communities can now be founded purely on common interest rather than spatial and temporal proximity.

relocating:

Making sense of local spaces and local communities is a problem that has been almost completely overlooked in all the efforts to make long distance communication easier.

There is a lack of effective interfaces to the spaces around us and a lack of tools specifically designed to facilitate local face to face community.

knowing where they are

cell phones (which at least allow you to go outside) are soon going to know where they are.

Given that cell phones have already become indistinguishable from computers and that they now come with internet connec­tions, the fact that they will know where they are is significant.

location aware possiblilities

Portable devices that know where they are can coordinate. They can make sure that two people who are close to one another and ought to meet, do meet, they can tell a person what they need to know about the space around them, they can link up people with something to exchange (according to unconventional or conven­tional ideas of what is sharable or exchangeable).

The potential for unnecessary barriers between people (walls, streets, not knowing each other) to be lowered is increasing.

The space local to people can become less opaque, they can see their location in terms more sophisticated than their line of sight. They can see the space in terms of who and what are within a given distance from them.

Developments in communication, from newspapers, the telegraph network, and TV, onwards have focused on making distance irrelevant.

On allowing people to communicate, observe and participate in events, at a distance from them. But a new technological platform is evolving that can make sense of the space immediately around us in a radical new way.

localising technology

Knowing more about where you are is an obvious problem, but in digital technology terms it has only recently become deeply solv­able (because we only just found ourselves with cheap internet connected cell phones that can know where they are).

Historically technology was about community and local orienta­tion, maps, church bells aligned to clocks for community time keeping, and astrolabes and sextants for star navigation were all significant technological enhancements grounded in making better use of local space and time.

new ways to mark, demarcate and annotate space

As well as facilitating direct contact between people, location aware devices will allow people to invisibly mark, demarcate and annotate spaces.

If I want to add a note to a place, I don’t have to physically mark it, I can write a note, add the geographical coordinates of where I

want it left, add the note to a database on the internet and when someone else comes to the place where I left the note their device tells them my note is there and allows them to read it.

No physical note exists but there is a note at that point in space.

Retinal displays that fire a low powered laser directly onto the retina and are small enough to clip onto a pair of sunglasses will allow graphical objects to be associated with places (burning skulls for bad restaurants, spinning tetrahedrons..).

..a landscape augmented with a layer of invisible marking, annota­tion and symbolism.

symbolism and utility spectrum

Because space is shared and owned, there tends to be a bias towards utilitarian (street signs etc), owner orientated and com­mercial imagery. Tagging, other forms of graffiti and murals mostly fall outside these categories and get suppressed. Location aware devices would allow subjective and selectively viewable aug­mentation of environments and give people the freedom to mark, demarcate and annotate spaces based on criteria beyond those dictated by commercial, utilitarian and owner orientated interests.

Utility arguments have led recently to the marginalisation even of architects; with engineers arguing (usually on economic grounds) that structures can be built (by them) purely following principles of utility.

Human beings don’t use the buildings they live and work in just to symbolically demarcate spaces, they are used to get out of the rain, or to regulate temperature.

If meaning shifts from the structures themselves to devices, it still leaves a lot of structures…

A fraction of the infrastructure and buildings in human environ­ments are primarily symbolic, but given that most buildings do encode a lot of information beyond their utility, it represents a real shift to have what they encode fall into the hands of individuals and communities.

utopian, distopian, inevitable

In the UK there used to be just 3 TV channels, limited sources of popular culture and news..

now with the explosion in content, and the diverse sources of that content, society fragments and the wider community has fewer and fewer persistent common cultural reference points

the number of possible subjective realities multiplies..

So far, in media terms, this has largely been confined to what music you listen to, what films you watch, where you get your news. When you go outside what you see is much the same as what everyone else sees, the same street signs, the same adverts, the same shop fronts..

But what If real space is overlaid with layers of invisible symbol­ism. What if what you see is determined by what the intersection of your extended community and your interests dictate, as well as what is really there.

Your view of the space and other people is supplemented by additional subjective annotation and symbolism (electronic equiva­lents of the information communicated by signs, clothing, physical demarcation, shop fronts).

Social fragmentation extends as the technology reaches in to define the whole experience of the space in subjective terms (a dystopian, utopian, or inevitable outcome depending on your point of view).

There’s nothing new about subjective filtering of space and people, but externalising the idea and undermining the apparently fixed nature of the built environment erodes notions of common experience and common reference points.

real life

A lot of people live in a house on a street

They might have a good circle of friends

But they don’t know that many people on their street

Parallel to that street are many other streets

They don’t know many of the people on the other streets

Further there is very little (that is socially acceptable) that they can do to get to know more of the people on their street or on the other streets.

If they’re bored they have no way to find the other bored people, if they need to borrow something they have a very narrow range of people to ask, and they can’t ask everybody on all the streets.

If they lose a cat, they have to go around sticking photocopied photos of the cat to trees.

In short their interface to their local community is really bad (even if they have a copy of the local paper).

Maybe they go to the local coffee shop and while they’re standing in the queue they notice someone who looks interesting. What are the chances that they are going to say anything?

And that’s the place they live.

What about when they’re somewhere they don’t live

..then the problem is even worse. Even with a benign guide like the lonely planet, they’re restricted to reasonably reliable com­mercial interactions. No way to reach out to the local community except through extreme bravery, alcohol or accident.

Without a lonely planet they’re stuck with neon hotel signs and mcdonalds and guesswork.

Cities have scaled up so that more and more people live in them, but the people in them are further apart than ever. Idealised close communities can only be found on TV shows, corporate cam­puses and in the compounds of religious cults.

Which is not to say that nobody has a life, just that there are big and very real boundaries (walls, doors curtains, streets and

social convention) to making sense of your local environment and extending the life you have ended up with.

Conventional points of contact are very blunt, scary and primitive, notice boards at the gym, ads in the local paper, getting drunk, dating agencies, going to martial arts or meditation classes.. (the internet counterparts of these are just as scary, if not more so).

Solving the interface problem would mean making space more immediately familiar and usable and introducing people who wanted to be introduced.

new ways to relate to each other and leverage and extend the possibilities for local community

Leveraging the latent potential from parallel rows of silent houses:

- a playground control system (for making better use of the square of tarmac that is the playground)

- spontaneous help/disorder system (amish collective house build­ing, pushing broken cars, organising riots).

- a boredom finding and resolving system

- coordinating laundry

hitch hiking is practically dead but there are more cars going where you want to go than ever

there are millions of spare rooms and empty houses and millions of people who wouldn’t mind you spending the night if they had reason to trust you and you were interesting, or you could pay them, or you had something to exchange

..you could find yourself driving cars that aren’t yours, living in empty houses that aren’t yours..

40% of food used is wasted in the US, people don’t share

there might be a parking space when you need one, but you can’t ask the people who can see it even though you might pay to know what they know

There are opportunities to help and to be helped, to exchange or share, that the bluntness of our current social interfaces exclude.

The proposition is that there is latent potential in the system that cannot be utilised without changing or augmenting the system.

The barrier that stops these kinds of transactions taking place..

..is that there is no efficient way to broadcast a request selectively to a trusted group of people you don’t know inside a set geo­graphical radius.

..you could solve this tragedy of the commons through a combina­tion of location aware devices, a trust system and a system that could filter and coordinate need.

Common property (common to small self-defining groups rather than universally and arbitrarilly shared) could work if you could solve the trust problem, the filter problem, the location awareness problem and build an interface.

the wealthy tend to share stuff among themselves (because they trust the other wealthy people).

new ways to formalise the sharing and exchange of non monetised latent value

[In many countries sex is implicitly or explicitly, illegally or legally for sale..]

A sandwich shop is not the only place you can get a sandwich, but a sandwich shop is a specialised source of sandwiches. It’s exter­nally marked, and visible and identifiable as a sandwich shop, it’s designed to be open and entered by people, and the sandwiches are priced to clarify the nature of the transaction. Convention dictates and supports the efficient transfer of sandwiches from sandwich vendor to customer.

So convention, visibility, efficiency (through specialisation and centralisation), dictate that when you want a sandwich and you aren’t near your kitchen, you probably need to find a sandwich shop.

So you need to find a row of shops and then find the shop that sells the sandwiches.

..alternatively you could state what you were seeking (in this case a sandwich) selectively broadcast your request (perhaps to a local subset of a community with which you are aligned), state the range of exchange possibilities you would consider (information, work or money, conversation, things).

The range of responses might include automated directions to the local sandwich shop, or a note telling you to knock on the door of the house across the road (if you would be prepared to take some laundry to the Laundromat in exchange for a sandwich).

Despite there efficiency, shops, money and 20th century conven­tion have a limiting effect: on the range of formal exchanges that are possible, the people who can take part in those exchanges, and where those exchanges can take place.

The problem with barter systems is that they require an incredible level of serendipity, both parties have to have something the other party is prepared to accept if the transaction is to be successful. Which is why cash is such a useful neutral point of exchange. The simultaneous need problem is surmounted by the neutrality of cash.

Physical markets were the traditional way of making the required serendipity more likely to occur.

The ultimate evolutionary outcome was that you would specialise in geese, bring your geese to the geese seller, exchange your geese for some coins and then go and buy some chairs with the coins (and the chair seller would buy some chickens with your coins, converting your coins into chickens).

But life is getting more interesting and if you are able to efficiently extend the range of possible exchanges, exchange locations, and

 

people to exchange with, then why not?

So you get a sandwich without walking further, at the same time meeting someone from your extended community (the system handling at least the greater part of the trust issue), and make the exchange in terms that might be more favourable to you than handing over money (or perhaps your money circulates within your community rather than outside of it).

You can know what other possibilities exist.

moving from a web model to an externalised identity model

This idea of broadcasting need is part of what has been called the ‘pursuit’ model. If you have a mobile device, beyond its direct communication function, you probably want it to help solve your immediate problems and to help you fulfil your immediate needs.

To take this idea further you could use some kind of externalised identity that can give a respondent a context for your request (community allegiances for instance), and a formal way for each party to measure the trustworthiness of the other.

Building trust systems, externalising identity, and matching requests to possible respondents are extremely difficult problems. But they are prob­lems that people are working on solving.

Huge numbers of people are walking round with mobile phones, that is, wireless digital devices that already know roughly where they are (and these devices are getting rap­idly more capable). Most of these devices are struggling to fit in with the web model when clearly the screens are too small and the tiny keypads inadequate for traditional web surfing.

The web is already in some sense an exchange, a way to get information from one entity or person to another. The problem is to build a more efficient exchange.

The web lacks the concept of identity. You may have an email address, or a phone number, both of which in some sense func­tion as a persistent extension of you, (collecting and facilitating the exchange of messages), but they do not facilitate more sophisti­cated transactions on your behalf. They differ very little from the function of the mat below your letterbox. You may have a web page, but an individual’s (as opposed to a corporate or organisa­tional) webpage is usually a fairly static entity, a symbol, rather than a transaction mediating entity.

The point is that your internet identity is not a coherent, function­ing, device independent manifestation of you, it does not formally embody your trustworthiness, it does not formally record your community affiliations, it does not communicate your needs or solicit opportunities to fulfil the needs of others on your behalf.

The web model can work pretty well if you have the time and the skill to find what you want, but the constraints of mobile devices both require, inspire, and offer an opportunity to develop, more efficient, individual-centric, and spatially linked exchanges.

filtering, reputation, trust systems and infomediaries

the deep irony is that even as people are packed ever more closely together the gap between them widens.

People have spent the last 40 years devoting more and more time sitting in front of computer monitors and tv screens simulating community and ignoring the people living next door and down the street.

blocks of flats, estates, streets of people who only get to realise that they might get along, or be able to help each other, when something goes wrong.

filtering

You can filter who you talk to by speaking in a specific forum,. Leaving a notice on a notice board in a climbing wall means that only climbers get to see the notice. Leaving a note next to all the notes taped to a particular bus shelter near 110th at Broadway nyc near Columbia university means that you narrow down the range of people who see the note.

~ anonymity

There need to be good grounds for sanctioning meeting people you don’t know.

Real life filters include the anononymity conferred by front doors, walls, curtains and cars. Convention dictates that outside of a narrow range of transactions (com­mercial, educational, crisis…) people for the most part don’t talk to people they don’t know.

Real life filters tend to be quite blunt tools, but people prefer tend to prefer blunt filters to no filters. The kinds of people who try to break through these filters tend to confirm the need for them.

Filtering is a problem, and it is not confined to local communities but all kinds of communities. Email filtering attempts to remove junk mail. Joining an online discussion group focused on a spe­cific subject is a kind of filtering in itself, but within those groups it is often possible to block out the voices of participants you don’t want to hear.

Filtering is a problem aligned to trust. We mostly choose to inter­act with people we are both interested in and trust not to make our lives harder. A good filtering system with a trust component would make it possible to find more people who fit this criteria, locally or at a distance.

formalising trust

A workable trust system could be built around traditional mea­sures of trust

..friend of a friend, similar views, taste and or buying habits, edu­cation, community affiliations, financial status, employer, reputa­tion.

Even with an effective trust system in place, in interpersonal ????????????

 

relationships it still only serves as a guide and lowers the barrier, maybe making a face to face meeting more likely to be worthwhile or safe, it still comes down to the reality of the actual meeting to determine the reality behind those grounds for trust

Trust is a difficult problem” Jan Hauser, Sun microsystems

infomediaries

A system which requires information about you to be broadcast is unlikely to be acceptable.

The solution is a trusted intermediary, a third party that handles filtering without revealing personal details.

There has been a recent explosion in dating agencies, and while they handle a very specific problem, they are a model for mediat­ing between parties without directly revealing personal informa­tion.

A community agency built on similar principles but handling a much wider range of interactions would be interesting.

This could be a further iteration on ‘craigs list’ in san francisco which already functions as a kind of community agency, a digital equivalent of a community notice board, tied to the space only indirectly, but still capable of making things happen that would not otherwise happen.

Recently craigs list made the national news after a girl posted a note about a ‘gorgeous guy’ she kept seeing at the bus stop on her way to work. The result was that each morning more and more people turned up at the bus stop to see the ‘gorgeous guy’. The boy, who was increasingly aware of something strange going on, only became aware of the extent of his local celebrity when a friend of his worked out what was going on and told him.

A range of new, sophisticated and interesting, ways of mediating transactions and finding and interacting with people are becoming available, and location awareness adds another dimension to the possibilities.

architects and their machines for living in

Architects and planners have designed buildings, housing projects, and whole communities, and then tightly packing those places with people who don’t know each other, and doing so with­out being able to build sophisticated interfaces and information systems for those communities.

Cities are arguably so complicated and house so many people that we may actually need technology and augmentation to be effective and happy in them.

The most help that has been offered so far has been video sur­veillance, a dark form of augmentation, which assumes you can change people by watching them.

A more pragmatic and people friendly approach is a location aware one. In Brighton in the UK and San Francisco in the US bus shelters now tell you when the next bus is coming (because they know where the bus is). This small thing will save souls, there is nothing worse than waiting hours for a bus that may or not ever come, it makes you feel so out of control.

..Corbusier and his machines for living in, Paolo Soleri and his arcologies and Archigram and the walking cities, all look like (and in the case of Corbusier actually are) nightmare scenarios, and the only thing that could make them happier places to live (given that tightly packed ‘modern’ alienated communities have become a reality) would be better interfaces to real and local spaces. This is a troubling thought given that it is dark to propose more techno­logical innovation as a solution to the problems that technological innovation has brought forth.

But if lost old age pensioners on a difficult housing estate could communicate with each other and coordinate their actions and their voice, it might make a difference to them.

With hindsight and foresight it seems inevitable that housing projects couldn’t work without information systems, and those information systems haven’t been built yet.

..and I want to know where my keys are and where I left my wallet, I want to be able to call them and ask them where they are. I want solutions to very ordinary, localised, spatially linked problems.

concept mapping [tinderbox view]

[basic introduction]

Say I have 10 different, but loosely associated, thoughts noted on a piece of paper and I open Tinderbox. Hitting return creates a new small rectangular box on the screen, the associated dialogue lets me name the box and then a text window opens where I describe the thought in greater detail. The text box closes and I have a simple named box on the screen (double clicking brings up the longer text description).

I do this for ten different thoughts and end up with ten rectangular boxes spatially arranged on the screen

[image]

I can then start to group and arrange them, cluster some, and separate others, leaving me with whatever spatial arrangement represents the order my intuition suggests. Then having decided on some arrangement and some grouping I can represent that

graphically by colouring groups of boxes differently. I’m free to say what the color means, based on the grouping I’ve established, maybe priority, maybe similarity, or whatever.

Say three of the boxes (now all made green say by slecting a colour for this sub-group) are places. I select them, open the new attributes dialogue and add a common attribute ‘geo’. I decide that this attribute is boolean in character (that is it can be set to true or false) I set the ‘geo’ attribute for each of the three ‘place’ boxes to true. then I add two more attributes for this green group: latitude and longitude. Incidentally having defined them once these are now global attributes and I can set geo, latitude and longitude values for any box (most new, and existing, boxes will by default have geo set to false and, not being places, will have neither lati­tude nor longitude values set or immediately visible.)

So now i have three ‘places’ and have decided that places are a new class of thing in my document.

Say three more of the boxes reference recent images i’ve cre­ated, I set their colours to blue to differentiate them, since ‘images’ suggest various properties I open the new attributes dialogue and create relevant attributes. I create a new attribute ‘image’ (boolean, and set to true), also ‘path’ – the path to the image file (a string attribute), ‘height’ and ‘width’, image file format etc.

Two of these images are schematics, but one is a photo of a place, so I set geo=true on that image and add longitude and latitude. Now should this box be blue or green? Doesn’t matter. If I search my document for ‘geo=true’ it’ll turn up and if i search for ‘image=true’ it’ll turn up (and there’s also now the new intersect­ing set of images which are also places which may turn out to be useful).

The remaining four boxes contain specific thoughts and are conceptually related, I decide that one is the central thought and the others are attendant so I drag the three dependant thoughts on to the conceptually central thought box and the main thought turns into a small container with the three dependants inside it. Hierarchy

When I double click the central thought box, this takes me down a level to where there are just the three attendant thoughts. Given these I decide to link two of the boxes to the third, I do this by click and dragging, arbitrarilly deciding to name the link type as ‘requires’ when the link type dialogue box appears, the boxes are now joined with two arrows with the small annotation ‘requires’ visible above the connecting lines.

I go up a level, double click the central thought box and add more to the text description. I also decide that one of the images is relevant and add an ‘include’ reference to the one of the image boxes.

Now I have given a shape to what were ten thoughts jotted down linearly on a piece of paper.

And not a cosmetic shape, a structure based on association and categorisation. In the document I have many more pre-existing boxes from earlier work and I can start to link boxes from the rest of the map to the new boxes and maybe move some from else­where into the new central thought container.

This map view is just one of many available ordering views on the box entities. As far as there is hierarchy I can choose to view that hierarchy as a tree diagram where all notes are present but notes that are inside other notes are shown indented. There are a number of other views.

I can also create a box and associate a search query such as ‘geo=true’ and have aliases of all the relevant boxes appear inside that box. i can also simply open a search window and have all the boxes matching a keyword appear as a temproarilly accessible list.

[end basic introduction]

At its heart is a database, which is fine but nothing new. What is different is the level of freedom and intuition that can instantly and flexibly be applied to an aribitrary set of ‘things’ without starting from a preconceived idea of what they are and where they should go. The rectangular boxes (the basic thought unit) can be any­thing I need to organise, or think about.

I start with boxes, cluster them, colour them, add attributes. I develop objects based on common sets of attributes, and allow real order to emerge rather than deciding on a data structure and trying to fit my thoughts into it. It’s not that all of this is not possible with MYSQL, python and a piece of paper, but the extent to which I don’t have to think about MYSQL, python (or the edges of the piece of paper) at the point at which i’m defining my knowledge representation, means that the knowledge can get on with decid­ing how it wants to be represented.

In fact once you have your spatial map, your attributes, your hierarchy (and changed them all around a few times, continually tweaking all the way), you can output your data as an xml file and feed it straight into MYSQL or whatever.

Alternatively you can create templates and output straight to html, rdf, rss (place feeds, image feeds, thought feeds) or just plain text.

At this point you can also simplify your knowledge representation, for example outputting a complex structure as a linear timeline listing only your latest ‘thought’ notes (ignoring ‘place’ and ‘image’ objects except where they are included within ‘thought’ notes, or where thought notes have ‘geo’ attributes). Maybe only output orange thought notes. The resulting ..blog is a watered down digestable feed derived from a more complex structure (you can of course output the complex structure as well – no rules).

So it lets your thoughts decide how they fit together using user defined spatial maps, links, attributes and hierarchy. All flexible. You end up with a knowledge representation that helps you both to organise further thoughts and derive further thoughts.

The level of freedom may not make everyone comfortable. Having to continually define attributes and hierarchy and remember where you are in mass of densely connected multilayered mess of boxes might not be for everyone [..it’s great]. The level of constraint may offend some programmers who want to hack together something very specific and outside the shapes tinderbox allows. But for people somewhere between those extremes it’s more than useful.

There are some issues (take it as you find it, it pretty much works as promised and for something so useful that is no small achieve­ment), but it’s obviously been around a long time and been worked on by some very bright people (and people who think about interfaces). The documentation is minimal but intuition and persistence usually get you where you want to go.

In fact tools like this (and there are a few, although Tinderbox is the one I’m working with, Ideagraph being more PC focused) are the missing link as far as ordinary users are concerned. Browsers,

 

filemanagers, email and newsreaders, all of them fail to impose any useful order on the material they continually stockpile. The basic unit of the internet from a general user point of view looks like being the paragraph of text, whether email, blog entry, section of an IM/IRC exchange or whatever. Tools like Tinderbox can break through the stranglehold of timelines, alphabetical indexing and a few inflexible categories, that for many users are starting to feel like bleak living arrangements. It is still the case that most of the tools that offer you flexible control of your metadata are ‘roll your own’, or enterprise level, at least at the moment.

simply put

file system <-> personal knowledge representation <-> browser <-> aggregators and peers

the first two should be integrated maybe?

Tinderbox and Ideagraph may well be what mosaic for the seman­tic web looks like.

On the Tinderbox site and elsewhere it’s been called a ‘personal content manager’ which is kind of OK, but I think it overstates the outward cosmetic view. Multiple and flexible presentation output forms are an easy byproduct of the data knowledge representa­tion possible using tinderbox, but the visual, spatial, intuitive, conceptual model is much more valuable, its a place to think. In terms of thinking tools it’s the difference between making a model that looks like an aeroplane and one that flies like an aeroplane. Tinderbox being in the latter category.

Recently headmap produced a movabletype plugin, reached the point where it needed two extra fields: longitude and latitude, and found that short of getting users to hack the Perl (which didn’t feel like an option) it wasn’t possible (at the time) [In defense one of the reasons for the success of blogging tools is the simplicity of the interface]. It wouldn’t be so hard to create a specialised authoring tool for ‘place’ feeds or to find a blogging tool that allowed extra fields. But really the problem is not just adding extra fields, its more general, how can ordinary users work with open frameworks like RDF without flexible agnostic authoring tools. Tinderbox is such a tool, RDF no problem as long as you create the right set of attributes and build a template, the output can be anything and is very much a side effect (its form agnostic).

It allows the building, authoring, and organising of knowledge rep­resentations (not arcane databases accessible through the slit of minimal web form or regular expressions at the command line, not collections of oddly named text files or an endless spreadsheet grid, and not a $6 million custom built enterprise specific solution).

Referencing the example above, having set the ‘geo’ attribute and added ‘longitude’ and ‘latitude’, those values are accessible when you export. The export template for an RDF place feed for one of the green ‘geo’ notes above might include:

^get(geolat)^ ^get(geolong)^

which in the final feed resolves the tinderbox attributes to

..a great tool for ontological anarchists

interfaces to the semantic web

Ted Nelson, who was the first to see the potential of hypertext had as his data ideal layers of acetate representing user annotations of an original document – you choose the layers you want to see.

Apparently Google’s initial goal was to develop a web annotation layer.

Personal data is increasingly structured and parcelled up (XML), parcels of marked up data are given unique addresses (a URL), then metadata about and relationships between URL’s (and more generally URI’s) can be stored anywhere with URI’s, XML and RDF tags acting as keys asserting the links and relationships between the seperated data.

This allows for a personal XML feed representing personal annotation applicable to various user defined URLs (the original document [URL] may contain author annotation, and allow direct reader annotation – so such seperations are arbitrary – but thinking about personal annotation feeds and documents seperately helps in thinking about this stuff).

Moreover using RDF it is possible for a machine (or a person) to succinctly deduce the *meaning* of the link a person (or machine) perceives between URI’s – and further those connections are expressed in terms of a shared and agreed and extensible vocabulary (RDF)

i.e. not just conventional links and metadata but traversible Triples:

Sam [subject - URI = sam’s email] –> KNOWS [connective (from shared RDF vocabulary e.g. FOAF)] –> Anna [object - URI - anna’s email]

That is a machine and human comprehensible relationship for­mally asserted between two URI’s using defined ontologies and vocabularies.

On the interface level structured data makes for a positive feed­back loop. Which is what has been experienced with blogs. A bit of structure has led to blogdex, technorati, trackback, feedster etc. Adding explicit machine readable meaning to links offers similar possibilities.

exposing and structuring data and clearly defining relationships in a distributed environment offers a vision of a new kind of interface.

Something that looks more like Danny Ayers Ideagraph or Mark Bernstein’s Tinderbox .

These tools allow you to create a personal and sophisticated annotation layer to data both local and external, and also to expose your annotation layer as an XML feed. They are very visual tools. More tangibly like maps and graphs than conven­tional PIM’s like Outlook.

A new object is depicted as a coloured rectangle, it can refer to itself or a file elsewhere, you name it, you can open it and edit it, adding text and images. Close it again and connect it to other boxes using RDF or your own vocabulary to define the nature of the links. Your main view is boxes arranged in front of you with arrows (carrying link annotation) connecting them.

 

These kind of tools allow for grouping of all kinds, by color, creation date, parent child, and hierachical relationships, link attri­butes, keywords – all allowing you to rapidly define different views on your data, both in terms of search criteria and in terms of the visual appearence of your map view (treemaps, outlines, charts).

From the point of view of the graph based front end note also the Plumb Design Thinkmap application Visual Thesaurus , and all the Touchgraph applications, these graphical views on data are starting to look like genuinely viable models for future desktop (and wearable) interfaces. Intensely structured logically linked data lends itself to this kind of visualisation.

Just using these tools results in smaller chunks of data, more structure, more link attributes, more metadata and more URI annotation (in the same way traditional blogging tools enforced structure and added metadata).

Given connections and nesting and a range of attributes to choose your focus attribute from, these models are highly navi­gable, and in an open context start to realise some of the promise of mindmapping and mindmap sharing.

More than personal content management tools they give the power to define relationships between things to the only intelligent agents on the net: people (intelligent tools + people = intellingent agents)

After a decade of hugely expensive visual, graph based, business management tools focused on exposing arcane databases as simple objects that can be linked according a vocabulary in tune with busi­ness logic, for business leaders to apply their intuition to (without having to send requests to the IT department), some of that power is trick­ling down into the hands of ordinary internet users.

Create a simple graphical representation of a local file with a URI linking the representation to the original file on your computer. Add attributes and metadata to the representation and then link the representation to other representations of other files both local and external, and logically define the links. Share parts of this map and have the ability to expose local files within the shared parts of your maps. Further these representations can become more complex [defining methods and attributes] defining the terms of interaction and function of what they represent. Drop, or link, a simple file representation on, or to, a function representation and generate new entities, or change the nature of existing ones, or maybe add representations of particular types together.

..and these ideas are rapidly headed towards the ordinary user: from the Semantic Web, open and closed source interface proj­ects like Ideagraph and Tinderbox to Microsoft’s Longhorn and Mitch Kapor’s Chandler.

these developments address..

the connections between things, the nature of the connections between things and seeing the connections between things.

These connections are now viewed as valuable enough to be considered seperately from the the things they connect.

..you can choose to expose as much or as little of your personal map as you like.

..you can traverse these maps to find information relevant to a given search criteria, or if you like someones point of view, just follow where they and their map leads you.

the paragraph of text

..have a lot invested in skywriting

been thinking about the paragraph of text as the sort of ‘golden section’ of internet communication

how blogs and email assume the same basic form, roughly a paragraph of text

and how they both (one sometimes seemingly, the other actually) resemble a part of an ongoing conversation

SMS users struggle with great ingenuity to get text messages full enough of meaning to reach the email/ blog paragraph level of useful meaning.

Telephone conversations are useful but email and blog entries have the advantage of being written down and we can do a lot more at the moment with stuff thats written down than recorded voices.

blogs, email, usenet, news feeds, text messaging.

. just paragraphs, metadata and a database on a network

these thoughts stem from the idea of annotating space, there will be visual ways to annotate space, but a paragraph of text would go a long way towards starting a conversation about a place.

back to the oral tradition through skywriting

“What was the adaptive advantage of language? It can only be measured in relation to the competition. Those who cannot acquire knowledge by hearsay must do it the hard way: by direct, trial-and-error sensorimotor experience.

.. In an evolutionary competition, the symbolic “thieves” quickly out-survive and out-reproduce the honest sensorimotor “toilers,” who must learn everything the hard way, from experience.

.. language is a form of reciprocal altruism: Except if we are competing for the same finite resource, you lose nothing if you tell me, honestly, what is and is not edible, or which are and are not dangerous predators; and tomorrow it may be I who know something that you do not. So “cognitive barter “ may be a better descriptor than “ theft “ for the adaptive advantage conferred by language.

.. Dialogue not only informs, and trades existing information; it also elicits and stimulates novel interdigitating thoughts that again may not have occurred solo. In that sense, interactive cognition may create information.

.. Surely it is writing that made science and scholarship if

 

not possible, then at least far more likely … But writing also had a dramatic negative effect … on the temporal, interactive dimension of linguistic discourse. It instantly transformed it into asynchronous, off-line monologues instead of the synchronous dialogues for which our brains and our thinking capacity are optimized.

.. One of the limiting factors in oral monologues is memory: If, in a conversation, you speak for too long without letting me reply, I will surely forget some of what you said, and my eventual reply is bound to be much less focussed than it could have been if the chunks between interventions had been smaller.”

..thinking about location awareness in terms of cutting together different subjective viewpoints

..and also about knowledge management tools.

The conscious mind seems to be one strata of a larger internal awareness.

The conscious mind has many ways to communicate with and access this larger awareness.

..and one way is through cut-up texts

The cut-up techniques of Brion Gysin and William Burroughs aimed to actively liberate meaning from texts and to bypass the tyranny of conscious attempts at organisation of ideas.

Gysin suggests taking texts that have meaning for you and some that don.t, cut them together and find what you are looking for (or at least something new) in your interpretation of what results from the cutup

..a good addition to a knowledge management tool would be one of the many cut-up engines on the net

There are a number of software cut-up engines, all you have to do is cut and paste one or more texts into them and hit the ‘cutup’ button

The ancient Art of Memory was a highly prized and praised skill as Frances Yates has shown (YATES66). It is of no coincidence that the ancients used architectonic models for their artificial memory technology.

[.]

It was for this reason, that everyone learning to apply the Art of Memory did so perambulating the halls and staircases of the temples and monuments. In these perambulations, the candidates learned unconsciously the intricate connections that had been incorporated into the construction of these buildings.

4.1. The tradition of the Ars memoriae

Art of Memory, Raimundus Lullus, Giulio Camillo, Giordano Bruno, Leibniz: Characteristica Universalis, Aby Warburg.

The issue of memory is a focus point in the discussion.

We must not be confused by contemporary mis-uses of the word memory for technological storage devices as they appear in computers: e.g. Random Access Memory RAM. Human memory is still an entirely different matter. This is just a good example how we can be totally mislead by wrong terminology.

These ratios could be experienced fully by the kinesthetic sense and much better than through alphabetically framed analytical and mental exercises as has become the norm in our linear-text based age.

Anything experienced and walked-through physically, with the kinesthetic sense, becomes an engram. It is memory matter that will not decay for life. (Everyone who has learned to ride a bicycle will attest to this. Totally unlike anything one has learned analytically and mentally only. This was, and still is, the secret of the Ancient Art of Memory. Since the alphabetically framed mind will be reluctant to even consider such an option, there is a good chance that it will be lost forever, even though it is mentioned here. It is hard to penetrate the fortified walls of 3000 years alphabetikolobos.

4.1.2. The peripatetic school and the implantable Walkstation

 

Perhaps it is not just a coincidence that the school of Aristoteles was called the peripatetic school (=perambulate). Because even though he never mentions the principle, Aristoteles was a quite acute observer, and the fact that all the orators and lawyers composed their speeches perambulating in the halls and staircases of the temples and public buildings, might not have escaped him. Even without the more esoteric principles of cosmic harmony, it is undoubtedly a definite factor that helps learning, and thinking, when you keep the body in motion, breathe some fresh air, and see some beautiful vistas.

The public building programmes, starting with Perikles, had seen to it, that this place was one of the most breath-taking and stunning visual experiences that any place on the globe could provide. So, even if he doesn’t mention it in his philosophy, Aristoteles might have known what he did, and why he did it.

[.]

Of course, a little technology that helps us do our word processing while walking might come in handy. If we have a Walkman, we can also afford a Walky-Symbolator. We are technically not too far away from the implantable Workstation, which we then call a Walkstation.

the connections between things more interesting than the individual things

Doesn’t it seem like the action in personal publishing has moved away from weblogs… and towards the interaction between weblogs? The blogosphere has become a living breathing entity, capable of behaviour that’s increasingly difficult to predict.

Which of course, brings us back to my latest obsession: Ants. As Mitchel Resnick puts it, there’s a similar relationship between ants and their colony (emphasis added)

Why the growing interest in ants? Many people, it seems, are intrigued with the collective nature of ant behaviour. Each individual ant is quite simple. But an ant colony as a whole is capable of rather sophisticated behaviour.

This is exactly what I mean! Extending the metaphor a bit:

PCs : Networks :: weblogs : blogosphere :: ants : colony

I definitely wouldn’t say that ‘each individual blogger is quite simple’. But there’s definitely some extremely sophisticated behaviour emerging out of the interaction between bloggers.

context aware applications

The following is an example of a complete stick-e note:

[The above note would be triggered if the user was within the specified area, facing South in December.]

[...]

PARCTab applications created at Xerox PARC were concerned with presenting information. These included:

- presenting information about the room the user was in, e.g. when in the library they could be presented with information about the library. This information could either pop up automatically, or could be under the user’s control (e.g. there could be a This-room button in the menu which, when selected by the user, gave information about the current room).

- helping the user find the most convenient local resource, e.g. the nearest printer. The PARCTab can present a menu showing all the available printers, and the distance of each from the user’s current room.

- attaching a certain UNIX directory to a room; when any user enters the room all the files in the directory are shown. The directory is writeable by everybody, so anyone can post a note in a room by creating a file within its directory (in an office: “Back in 5 minutes”, “Remember to turn the equipment off if you are the last to leave”).

[...]

Authorship [of stick-e notes]

how an author sets about creating a set of notes.

The approach to authorship follows the simple Post-it note metaphor:

(1) You write a note on your PDA screen, using a keyboard, stylus or whatever other means is offered. As an example you might be on the outward leg of a hike, and your note, written on a PDA with a location sensor attached, says “Turned left here, by the pond”.

(2) This is automatically stored as the body of a stick-e note, with the present context attached as its context. Thus if you are at a certain location, this is the context for the new note.

(3) Whenever you return to the same context, the note is triggered. Therefore, on the return leg of your walk you will be alerted to the point where you turned left on the way out.

At the end of the walk you might wish to save all the notes you made; these would form a stick-e document. You might give the document to a friend or even publish it on the web after you had refined it a bit.

The above approach applies equally well to our animal example. Here the context will be in the presence of a certain animal rather than at a location. We will take this to be the animal most recently detected by the sensor.

 

[...]

Stick-e notes are, perhaps, half way between a program and a document: certainly the contexts have to be as accurately specified as a program. There is little doubt that maintenance questions will be the limiting factor on how many notes it is viable to handle: would a tourist application of 10,000 notes be tractable? We have tried to anticipate the potential maintenance problems by adding features associated with programming languages: these include the use of types, declarations and testing facilities.

the declaration of interdependence

WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT (UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES).

ABSTRACT

The internet is a form of currency with more cool features than cash.

Thingster

The internet is a transport mechanism. A way of transfering infor­mation from one place to another.

As a transport system it is well suited to facilitating exchange.

It’s an economy engine, rather than an economic engine. It hosts markets.

Link economies, file sharing economies and one particular world wide garage sale.

It can bring a whole complex market infrastructure to any given physical transaction

rather than looking for cash replacements, for some mythical ecash, consider the internet itself as the exchange facilitating mechanism.

Lists

Napster was about everyone making a list (computer generated list of your mp3’s), aggregating all the lists and then allowing people to search the final indexed Uberlist for a fast match (local being a metaphor for fast).

Blogging is about a list of discrete diary entries each containing the currency of the blog world: identity, thoughts and links.

Again the lists are aggregated, you can search for thoughts, and blogs get ranked according to how many inbound links they accu­mulate and how fresh they are.

Like napster you can see what else a user has, if you happen accross something you like from that user. You just use an RSS newsreader to subscribe to that bloggers changing list of thoughts.

Its about structured aggregated lists…

Geourl

Now there’s GEOURL

geourl means that bloggers can specify the geographical location of there blogs in a general and machine readable and more specifically an aggregator/search friendly way.headmap has focused on the idea of overlaying the internet on to the real world and the real space,

and this line of thought extends to..

CONNECTING THESE NEW AGGRESIVE COM­PETITIVE DISTRIBUTED, AD HOC, ‘WEIGHTLESS’ ECONOMIES TO THE WORLD OF REAL THINGS.

Back to ebay

..all of which leads back to Ebay

“the market may be bottom up but its populated by chronically top heavy agents” Steven johnson, Emergence

maybe you have a lot of stuff, and some of it you’d be prepared to exchange or sell. You could use a service like Ebay, but they charge you for the privilege of selling your stuff, you have to go to them and you have keep an eye on their site.

Why not just make a list of your stuff and put it somewhere so that potential buyers can come to you..

Aren’t there tools for that now?

Couldn’t you make a tool to allow the creation of structured lists of real physical stuff and create a specialised list aggregator for this? Put GEOURL tags in the individual lists and have the aggregator index the lists by location, category and freshness for ordinary people to search for stuff in their area.

And this is the bare minimum..

 

..couldn’t you create external modules to plug into this open system? Reputation modules, privacy modules, maybe FOAF (friend of a friend) networks for distributing lists among your friends rather than just to everyone.

Wouldn’t this create a more generalised open and competitive market than Ebay?

And why stop there?

Exchange Criteria

Extending the principle you could also add a list of the stuff you NEED. Then the aggregator can start automatically matching needs to wants and buyers to sellers; connecting the right people in the right location. And this kind of market could sustain more complex exchange criteria than cash. In fact it could support ALL KINDS OF EXCHANGE CRITERIA

If two people want what the other has this system can hook them up. They can then decide the basis for the exchange.

One alternative criteria would be barter. Barter could work. If time, location and needs and wants are all in the sytem, needs can matched up to wants.

This doesn’t have to be a simple two person match. If joe needs what tom has and tom needs what sam has and sam needs what joe has, and they all live locally, the system can hook them up.

Mobile Computing

None of this takes into account the mobile computing revolution thats under way. Decen­tralised mesh networks. Take the center out of the system.

Theres room for a gift economy and trust modules here.So maybe barter has been forced so far into the subconscious of western society that its going to be hard to bring to the surface.

People still remember libraries though…

Books

Perhaps intitially restrict the systems exchange space to books.

Josh Schachter of GEOURL suggests: consider a ‘like for like’ exchange of just and only books. You make a list of books you have and books you need. Books have a namespace (ISBN) which is useful. And books have an abnormally large spread; that is you tend not to be able to sell a book for anything like what you paid for it despite its continued value to someone else who wants the book. So if you can exchange a book you no longer need you’re saving money and recirculating something which previously wasn’t cost effective to get rid of. Also if someone has a book you want and you have a book they want, you might have something in common.

The consequences of such a system working could be far reach­ing.

Just taking the final limited book example: this is a worldwide interconnected and distributed library.

If the system were generalised it could become a payment mechanism. A real supplement to cash. Your exchange list could include services (things you can do for others) as well as things, so that you could refer people to your list as means to get what you need. The internet is facilitating a wider range of exchange possibilities and market permutations, and by extenstion real life cooperation and collaboration.

Commercial Opportunities

None of this excludes traditional business oportunities. In fact an open system would create considerable opportunities and compe­tition. An intermediary could handle the transaction much as ebay does, maintaining a reputation database that determines the level of risk involved with dealing with a particular seller and taking a cut of the transaction. But fundamentally this system leaves the choice up to the user, whether to negotiate directly or engage a third party to handle the transaction.

Identity and Reputation

More interestingly it reinforces the right model for the future of the internet. The identity and reputation component, and the links between things are the only part behind walls everything else is distributed and open (even when its secured).

Hedges not walls.

Initially such a system could be linked to blogs. The reputation of buyer and seller can be assessed in terms of the bloggers repututation.

and community or social links implied by a system like FOAF (friend of a friend).

Exporting successful internet models to physical reality

Our collective distributed abstract exchange mechanisms are resulting in exponential (abstract) gains

physical exchange along the same lines will behave differently. But without a new model for physical interdependence how are we going to sustain these abstract models?

looking at the fascinating, aggressive and competitive collective distributed internet models – open source, napster, blogs..

We can stretch the models of cooperation, collaboration and decentralisation and above all collective interdependence

to include world of real physical things

“Decentralised production and development have done wonders for the world of open source software, where certain fundamental rights of ownership have been disavowed, but it remains a real question whether the more proprietary wing of late capitalism can model its internal organisation after ant farms or neural nets.” Steven Johnson, Emergence.

But this is about augmenting capitalism not replacing it. Its not

a Let system its instant localised market making. Cash is very efficient and will persist, but perhaps alongside a raft of other exchange mechanisms (including Let systems)

[..and doing all this is not that hard all of a sudden]

Napster and Ebay

..at its height napster may have had somewhere in the region of 50 million users.

..an estimated 30 million people were using Ebay in 2001

Ebay was one of the first internet stocks to be excessively over­valued. It is also one of the few internet companies that has been consistently profitable

When Ebay emerged as a phenomenon, people questioned its value. There was an argument in Ebay’s favour that went something like this: Ebay is a model for how all business will be conducted in future. When questioned, the woman running the company stated that Ebay was just a big garage sale.

Trade on Ebay doesn’t show up in the GDP. But it is having an impact on the economy.

Manufacturers have reported dramatic falls in returned good. People just sell the stuff they used to take back on Ebay.

And Ebay is efficient for both buyers and sellers. There’s a story about a woman who was selling a broken printer on Ebay, in the end someone bid $50 dollars for it and went round to pick it up. When he arrived she said to him ‘it’s not worth $50, i can’t take the money from you’, he replied ‘it is to me’ left the money on the table and took the printer home.

Ebay in many ways is an old school DotCom. You enter Ebay’s world, you play by Ebay’s rules. Even though it looks like a decen­tralised market the center holds, the buyer is seperated from the seller even as they are brought together. Ebay is not peer to peer. Ebay is not like gnutella or kazaa.

What components are most valuable?: maybe the central idea, the cash in the bank, the brand, the reputation system, the ability to mitigate risk and preserve the privacy of both the buyer and the seller, the payment system.

Internet Evolution

The last six months have seen a new embryonic internet emerge into the light.

This new internet is more decentralised, structured, logically inter­connected, people centred, and increasingly location aware

..maybe you have a newsreader that goes and gets rss feeds to save you trawling your favourite sites, maybe you have a blog which kicks out a structured rss feed and pings a blog search and analysis engine. Maybe you use one of the new selective blog search engines like feedster or blog link analysis engines like blogdex and technorati, or even a blog extended family tracker like blogstreet. Maybe you see the patterns emerging at a higher level. Blogs are now less interesting than the relations between them. Blogs are things to be aggregated, searched for patterns, ranked, indexed, analysed, those results being valuable to ordi­nary users as much as academics. What are bloggers tripping out on right now? Check blogdex. Feedster has a lag of about an hour, Google sometimes as much as a month. These tools are selective and they can become more so, answer questions like: what is this extended familly of bloggers tripping out about, what are my friends tripping out about?

All these new capabilities are emerging through distributed col­lectve tweaking.

rabid change in the techno economic subsystem

“the realities were money, prices, capital, shares: the environment itself, like most of human existence, was treated as an abstraction. Air and sunlight, because of their deplorable lack of value in exchange, had no reality at all.”

“the new style, as it diffuses, is bound to cause rabid change in the techno-economic subsystem. However this system coexists with the other main subsystem within capitalism, the socio-institutional framework. If the latter is mismatched to the former, problems ensue.”

Andrew Tylecote

free stuff

“However even those that have the technology to use a digital document on a primitive personal computer also have the power to reproduce and redistribute the document at virtually no cost. For this reason, publishers have had little interest in distributing articles in electronic form. Instead, publishers have focused on electronic publishing as an enhancement of bibliographic indexes. Copyright has encouraged the growth of libraries as an institutionalized system for allowing individuals the privilege of trading cost against convenience, of reading or borrowing rather than buying. In effect, this means that those who acquire and collect books and journals subsidize those who merely read them. Digital, networked information changes this, presenting a seductive vision of a library without walls but eroding the paradigms of print publishing at a very basic level. As network and storage resources grow in abundance, decline in cost, and are used for an increasing variety of purposes, the medium itself becomes increasingly non-specific, abstract, and trivial. [29] The distinction between the medium (the book) and the content (information) disappears with the dematerialization of the medium and disembodiment of information.”

Ebay seems a little bewildering, but they were considered by market analysts to be a potential model for future commerce on a more general level.

misunderstood technology

Redefining space.

Refining community, conflict, movement through space and con­trol of space in terms of new technologies.

The Germans decided to see the space very differently prior to WWII. In tanks and planes that hadn’t existed a few years earlier, they drove round and flew over static defences. They used radio communications and speed of movement in a way that those they attacked could not respond to. They spoke a new machine language.

Military theorists are struggling to assimilate the implications of new technology for future conflict.

Networked culture has yet to articulate itself clearly in spatial terms.

The real change happens when networked communities and data manifest in spatial terms.

Network culture is already colonising without being noticed.

..the nineties resemble the twenties

In this regard, the 1990s resemble the 1920s – the period after World War I – a time of major technological changes – with improvements in tanks, planes, and electronic warfare – leading to new doctrines that would optimize their use (e.g., blitzkrieg)

- achieved striking successes in the opening phases of World War II

the Germans, who, in their victory in the Battle of France in 1940, achieved success in four weeks on the same ground where victory had eluded them for four years during the previous war.

The implications of a revolutionary technology are often not widely perceived at first.

People try to fit the new technology into established ways of doing things; it is expected to prove itself in terms of existing standards of efficiency and effectiveness. It may take time to realize that inserting the new technology into old ways may create some new inefficiencies, even as some activities become more efficient. It may take still more time to realize that the activity itself – in both its operational and organizational dimensions – should be restructured, even transformed, in order to realize the full potential of the technology.

psychological time

[TIME]

The form of the environment can also affect one’s conception of time; psychological time as opposed to chronological time, and a varied and rich spatial environment can have the effect of making the experience seem longer than it actually is. This manipulation of experience works at a very basic psychological level. For example, we may recall times in our lives when we have moved to a new city or started a new school, and the first few months felt like years. Conversely, subsequent weeks or months seemed to pass much more quickly. Similarly, when we are young, time seems to pass very slowly, whereas when we are older, the years tend to blur together. It all has to do with how we take in information in our environment. When we are in a situation where everything is new and we are responding to a lot of stimuli, then time seems to pass slowly. When an environment is familiar, it becomes a seamless blur, and time appears to go by more quickly.

[where we are affects the quality of our lives]

Literature and theatre often make use of the manipulation of time to further the desired message and experience, either speeding, slowing, or an interplay of each in the narrative. The broad sweep of time in Tolstoy’s ‘War and Peace’, the slowing almost to a standstill of action in Joyce’s ‘Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man’ or Sterne’s Tristram Shandy, or the freezing of the moment epitomised by the Japanese haiku poem. Shakespeare, it is said, deliberately speeded up the action at the end of his plays to counteract the flagging attention of the audience. Analogously, architecture can be seen as a narrative of spaces and events, an unfolding story, that similarly manipulates one’s sense of time.

getting outside

facilitating community

Local communities can be brought closer together if common interest is allowed to intersect with location in a more efficient way. Why should people in a town not be able to establish more accu­rately where the people are who share their interests.

On the street where you live, the block where you live, the neigh­bourhood you live in, how many people do you know? And if you wanted to meet the subset of those people you might have some­thing in common with, is there any reasonable way to do it without waiting for ten years worth of arbitrary random interactions.

proximity

What if there was a system that could establish that someone like you was sitting around bored in the next street, that you had a mutual friend in common and the system can arrange to introduce the two of you, in a way acceptable to each of you.

Leverage proximity better.

Space games

What if you had to run around and climb things to play computer games rather than sitting in a room listening to headphones.

Imagine games which involved spatial challenges, and involved whole communities of kids, both building the levels and playing the games.

‘go to the end of the road and climb on the roof of the deserted cinema’

or rather (introducing a time element, and in order to get the next instruction)

‘RUN to the end of the road an climb on the roof of the deserted cinema.’

Such games might result in a few fatalities, but at least it would get kids out of the house.

mechanically regulating community

Church clocks predate personal time keeping.

The clock strikes loud to regulate a community otherwise discon­nected from awareness of mechanical time.

In this small japanese village a megaphone wakes the whole com­munity up in the morning, barks advice during the day and plays a lullaby at bedtime.

seemingly innocent english villages

Remember those hammer films, or those episodes of the Aveng­ers, when seemingly innocent English villages turn out to be living according to entirely different and usually malevolent rules and regimes. ‘The Wicca Man’ being the definitive example, a police­man (Edward Woodward) arrives on a small island to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, he slowly establishes that he is in a thinly disguised pagan community. At the end they trap him in a large wicca man and burn him to death according to pagan ritual practice.

In the absence of visual cues, and given the extent to which people can be permanently connected to distributed communities, it is going to be harder to make assumptions about people and there communities and affiliations.

Dualities

A person may seem to be one thing and turn out to be quite another.

double meanings [howard hughes hitch hiking]

“A recent tragic example of this occurred in the small town of North Zulch, Texas. There, some rural law enforcement officers apprehended a scruffy vagabond on a motorcycle after a high speed chase. Unfortunately he was killed. A search of his backpack revealed a device the size of a cigarette pack. The police officers, who were not computer literate, accidentally broke the device. This tiny device was actually a privately owned computer bulletin board system with some 15000 registered users.”

Bruce Sterling. Wired 1.4 Page 91

the richest most satisfying playground

Ignore mental abstraction for a moment in favour of physical real­ity. The real world is beautiful and complex and detailed.

simulation

I remember driving down a motorway on the way out of London once and seeing a tree in bright late afternoon sunlight and (after having spent too much time over the previous couple of months in dark rooms with 3d studio and photoshop), feeling struck by how much detail there was in the tree and how well rendered it was. This seemed like a dark thought at the time. Later on I worked at a company that worked on real-time physics simulation, and the implication (and motivation) was that reality could be simulated not just visually but at a deeper more fundamental level. Ulti­mately the simulation would be a satisfying alternate reality.

The vision of a 21st century games console hooked up by a fat pipe to the network, with accurate physics, stunning rendering, AI and other people to play with or against is still current. It is coming to pass in the shape of the Playstation 2 and the Microsoft X box. But it all seems rather dull and peripheral relative to the real revolution. The internet doesn’t need 3d, it certainly manifests in 3d, in the form of Quake, but it is not fundamental to it’s success or growth. Interesting but not core, not fundamental.

outdoors

The outdoors has been refined into an urban playground on the one hand, or a backdrop for extreme sports and ‘nature’ on the other. In some real sense it has already become a stage set.

The idea that you can now make a phone call from anywhere means the notion of wilderness is now defined by personal eco­nomics and technology rather than geographic location.

A friend of mine who recently returned from Africa told me about the battles and alliances in the bush, where multiple film crews from different networks and natural history programs were attempting to get shots of the same animal without getting each other in the shot. The noise and the lights and the generators transformed the wild into something else, but the product would ultimately be cut and dubbed to reflect the idealised image of ‘nature’ that audiences demanded

Mountaineers queue up to climb once rarefied and remote moun­tain peaks like Everest and K2. Western sport climbers bored of Thailand are bolting routes in Cambodia and Vietnam, widening their field of play. Snowboarders are helicoptered into remote areas to board down inaccessible runs.

Kids in urban areas skateboard, rollerblade and bike there way over every conceivable urban obstacle. Technology just makes outside more fun.

the space program

Two things are experiencing explosive growth, the internet and cell phones. Now the two phenomena are about to get integrated. From anywhere on earth for a relatively small amount of money you will be able to send and receive information including your geographical position.

During the sixties the space program began in earnest. From a cultural stand point it represented some assumptions: that there would be something on the moon when we got there and that actually going there was worthwhile.

When NASA abandoned manned missions to other planets, it represented a shift from an externally focused world view to an internally focused world view. From a belief in an outside that was worth reaching out for, to an obsession with creating internal worlds.

Computers have dominated our lives since that point, and the computing experience is epitomised by sitting at a screen and focusing on abstractions.

The idea of building whole worlds inside a computer, of not having to travel to real places because we have cameras and sensors that can tell us what is there persists, as does the conception of a computer as a complete internal world we can inhabit without leaving the safety of a bedroom.

Geography is unimportant we are told, communities, trade, com­munication, all are free of geographical constraints as a conse­quence of the internet. But communities of real people should be able to meet in real life, trade would be more efficient from at least a logistical point of view it were sensitive to geography, and com­municating with people who share a common interest locally can be more interesting given that you might be able to actually talk to them at some point without traveling to the other side of the world.

The frictionless abstractions that the internet has facilitated have already proved there worth, but imagine if those abstractions could be further leveraged to increase there potency.

Mobile phones are already augmenting reality in the moment. I can walk down the street (or through the bush), decide I need to know something, or talk to someone, and call to get an immedi­ate resolution to my need. (‘I’m lost, are you sitting in front of a computer?’ or ‘Melanie, you know about plants, can I eat these yellow berries..’)

1-800-questions

signs

The world is already full of external and consciously (and uncon­sciously) constructed visible symbol systems, advertising hoard­ings, street signs, bar-codes, lists of ingredients, post-it notes, shoes hanging from tram wires, clothing, architecture. All of which make reality richer more interesting or easier to navigate

One day there will be no visible signs. Or rather, visible signs will persist but the invisible visible (or audible) signs will be more important.

Knowing where I am and what I’m doing I can ask the network to tell me what information I should see or hear that would be useful or relevant given my position and interest.

Real signs might be reduced to machine readable symbols that just exist to link to the relevant information on the network. I read in the symbol on the engine block of my car and a repair manual (or voice link to a mechanic) opens up. Knowing the location of a wooden box exactly I could place a note in it without it actually being there. I could leave a huge burning skull in a restaurant I decide I don’t like.

augmentation precedents

The success of the film the Matrix was built on a vision of a digital world as complex and rich as our own. The interface to the out­side (the real world) was a cell phone [Nokia].

Neo: I need a little help

Operator: door on your left [Neo tries the wrong door] …no your other left

Morpheus at one point in the film asks the operator for a structural architectural plan of the building they are in.

The film can be read in a number of ways, one of the readings is as a key reality augmentation film, with just a cell phone the field operative can get any kind of information or help needed.

[Having an argument at the checkout at Safeway and calling in an airstrike from your cell phone. ]

Good film precedents for augmented reality technology include Terminator 1, which came out in the early eighties before 3d graphics were being used in films. The Terminator uses a 2d head up display which can supply schematic diagrams, telephone direc­tories, appropriate things to say and basic useful information like how to drive a truck. If anything that functionality is short of what is now possible.

Neal Stephensons ‘Snow Crash’ has characters who do noth­ing but gather arbitrary data using cameras and other sensors attached to there bodies. The information is fed to the library of congress and the data gatherers only get paid if anyone access­ing the library uses information they have gathered.

Another precedent is military technology, night vision, HUD’s, GPS, the whole C4i (Command, Control, Communications, Com­puters, and Intelligence) infrastructure.

For some time now wearable computers have been an area of interest in geek circles, at MIT and elsewhere, cameras and dis­plays strapped to the head, keypads sewn into jackets, computers in shoes.

At siggraph 99 there was a demonstration of a machine readable symbol system that would link to information on the net if it were scanned, scanning was done using pattern recognition and a worn camera.

All this reliance on gear is a little tedious

Cellphones (some location aware) with an internet capability are a reality. This is sufficient to begin moving in the right direction. Having said that, retinal displays exist and will soon be available and cheap, and as people become aware that the ability to aug­ment reality is no longer just a geek dream but a mass market

incompleteness

“Although the landscape before my eyes may well herald the features of the one that is hidden behind the hill, it does so only to a certain degree of indeterminacy: here there are meadows, over there perhaps woods, and, in any case, beyond the near horizon, I know only that there will be land or sky and, as far as the limits of the earth’s atmosphere are concerned, I know only that there is, in the most general terms, something to be perceived, and of those remote regions I possess only the style, in the abstract. In the same way, although each past is progressively enclosed in its entirety in the more recent past which has followed it, in virtue of the interlocking of intentionalities, the past degenerates, and the earliest years of my life are lost in the general existence of my body, of which I now know merely that it was already, at that time, confronted by colours and sounds, and a nature similar to the one I now see before me. I possess the remote past, as I do the future, therefore, only in principle, and my life is slipping away from me on all sides, and is circumscribed by impersonal zones. The contradiction which we find between the reality of the world and its incompleteness is the contradiction between the omnipresence of consciousness and its involvement in a field of presence.”

I know you will think it a good joke, as indeed it is, when I tell you that your old friend has caught three boars, very fine ones too. Yes, I really did, and without even changing any of lazy holiday habits. I was sitting by the hunting nets with my writing materials by my side instead of hunting spears, thinking something out and making notes, so that even if I came home empty handed I should at least have my notebooks filled. Don’t look down on mental activity of this kind, the mere fact of being alone in the depths of the woods in the silence necessary for hunting is a positive stimulus to thought. So next time you hunt yourself, follow my example and take your notebooks along with your lunch-basket and flask; you will find that Minerva walks the hills no less than Diana.

behind the next hill

I live in a box, I walk down the street and I pass other boxes. Occasionally I see someone briefly at a window, I somehow know that there are people in all the boxes, that the there are lives going on all around me that I cannot see. So much is taken on trust and the percentage of other lives that I see with my own eyes is small. Media feeds the feeling that I have a grasp of what is going on around me, and dulls my sense of distance and dislocation from the world. I think I know what other countries are like, what other parts of my home town are like, what other people are like, based entirely on information derived from media rather than personal experience. People are always different when you meet them, even if you know a lot about them

Zero media is a ‘year zero’ position. Seceding from passive media is quite common, lots of bright people I know don’t watch TV or read newspapers. They don’t trust the mass media, it seems to be feeding them a false sense of knowing and comfort, and dulling there capacity to know and act in the real space. How distanced is the news from the event it reports on, how much do I really know about the real experiences of others from having them presented to me on television in my living room. Doing a thing or being somewhere is always different than I thought it would be, even I’ve seen it done or been told what its like. The media offers me something, but not the experience itself. It can offer me a clue (and that can be a good thing), bad things have happened in former Yugoslavia for example, but I’d have to be there to begin to know what the pictures mean.

Cutting the media umbilical chord changes the whole shape of the world. Everything changes, you think about the space differently, you do more, you have more time and you make more of an effort to actually see rather than relying on mediated sources, rather than grinning mindlessly.

Cut television out of your life and life changes.

‘It was three days, before I was told that Princess Diana had died (very weird), I noticed a Union Jack at half-mast over the engineering building (extremely unusual), jets flew over Oxford in formation.

I overheard a conversation

‘how was London yesterday?’

‘lots of flowers, flags at half mast’

No information to tie all this together. And why should there be? It wasn’t a direct part of my life, I wasn’t tied into the mass media so it didn’t reach me.

Ironically you still hear about everything eventually anyway. People tell you things that only make sense if you assume some context you have no direct grasp of. I knew there were Spice Girls because people told me Spice Girls jokes.’

I have some vague model in my head of countries I have never been to, I trust that they are there and that if I boarded a plane and headed in the right direction that place would be, at least very roughly, as I had expected.

How to enhance appreciation of the world around you without, becoming dulled by a false sense of knowing.

Subordinate all information about an experience to what you con­sider to be the real experience.

guides

I want to have access to every conceivable kind of guide. I want voices to tell me about the place I happen to be in. I want to see the footprints of local people showing me how they navigate the space. I want to be able to ask for help of any kind and get it. I want to be able to call in air strikes at safeway.

wireless networking as a precursor to augmenting

In the wake of huge investment in high bandwidth wireless net­working, the networks that are evolving are different from there wired predecessors. The world wireless networking makes pos­sible is still to be built.

A world will emerge in the new spirit spontaneously and it will take time to establish its characteristics and determine its shape.

connect everything to everything

“The central act of the modern era is to connect everything to everything” Kevin Kelly

semantic reality

the initial impulse to connect everything to everything has already started to mutate into connecting everything to everything in a meaningful way, the semantic web adding meaning to the ele­ments of the network (data) and to the links between the elements (creating vocabularies to describe the nature of a given link).

the expansion of the highway system

“In 1919, Major Dwight D. Eisenhower had led his motorised military expedition across the United States with barely a road system to follow. It got him thinking about the motorways of the future. Thirty-seven years later, in 1956, president Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Interstate Highway Bill, which provided for a 41,000-mile superhighway system (later raised to 42,500 miles) that would crisscross the nation. The Federal government would pay 90 percent of the cost, with most of the money coming from a specially designated, non-divertible highway trust fund accumulated out of gasoline taxes. The program was actively advocated and promoted by a broad coalition of interests that became known as the ‘highway lobby’- automobile makers, state governments, truckers, car dealers, oil companies, ruber companies, trades unions, real estate developers. There was even the American Parking Association; after all, no matter how great the distance covered, drivers would eventually have to come to the end of their trips – and park their cars.

Eisenhower himself advocated the interstate highway program on several grounds: safety, congestion, the many billions of dollars wasted because of inefficient road transport, and, evoking the darkest fears of the Cold War, the requirements of civil defense. “In case of atomic attack on our cities,” he said, “the road net must permit quick evacuation of target areas.” The resulting program was massive, and Eisenhower took great pride in the scale of the construction, using wondrous and mesmerising comparisons. “The total pavement of the system would make a parking lot big enough to hold two third of all the automobiles in the United States,” he said. “The amount of concrete poured to form these roadways would build eighty Hoover Dams or six sidewalks to the moon. To build them, bulldozers and shovels would move enough dirt and rock to bury all of conneticut two feet deep. More than any single action by the government since the end of the war, this would change the fate of America.” His words were, if anything, an understatement.”

The Prize – Daniel Yergin

internet is not the same as freeway

The internet is not the same as the freeway network in america, but it has some themes in common.

The internet was designed to be able to survive a nuclear attack and at least a stated proposed use of the highway system was to enable evacuation during a nuclear attack.

Despite all the focus on internet companies like Amazon and Yahoo (the dotcoms), the real economic issue is not the compa­nies that claim to be the commercial internet, but the fact that like freeways, the internet just changes the way information and goods flow through the system. If the internet is having an impact on the real economy it is because it is affecting the way all transactions are being conducted (taking the broadest definition of transaction to include receipt of information, email, trade, website hits etc.).

a spatial external network

Unlike the internet, the freeway network is external and deals with the movement of goods and people as well as information.

augmenting the road system – parasitic technologies

The freeway network also represents a nexus point for the conver­gence of internet access and wireless location aware devices.

The freeways reshaped America, they conjured up suburbs, malls, motels, restaurants and gas stations. They reinforced America as a huge homogenous market that distributors could easily supply. They enabled easy migration from anywhere to anywhere. Given the level of mobility already built into American life and consciousness (LA is a great big freeway). What will the result of the addition of a new layer of technology augmenting this infra­structure conjure up. Cars will be location aware and connected to the internet. Driving through some remote valley you will know if something interesting is happening outside your field of view, or if a particular town is worth stopping in, or if someone in your extended community lives nearby. Your immediate surroundings can become more than just scenery merging into an irrelevant blur.

coordination and support of field operatives

“I asked the major over wind and noise about the strange warning sign that had caught my attention early in the morning. “Desert tortoise,” he shouted. “Fifty thousand dollars if you kill one.” “The scientists claimed to be matching the warfighters chip for chip in the information war. Tortoises were tagged with transmitters, tracked by radio telemetry, and graphed in grid locations by

computers. Landsat satellites were used to identify good habitat areas, aerial mine detection technology to find tortoises moving on the ground, and electronic sensors to warn off vehicles that might endanger the creatures.” James Der Derian – Cyber-Deterance [Wired 2.09]

military origins

the military gave us GPS, head up displays, computers even. C4i (command, control, communications, computers and intelligence) integrates all kinds of technologies, to augment the capabilities of troops in the field with every kind information and support, and to supply commanders with a model of the entire theatre of opera­tions.

prototypes

The technology developed to equip special forces for the next low intensity conflict.

Even less technologically advanced, and civilian orientated, forces are useful for determining precedent.

Police forces around the world make heavy use of the radio. Radio communication is a fundamental capability upon which command and control can be built. The radio links back to a com­mand centre, full of operators in contact with officers, with access to information (maps, databases etc.) men, vehicles and equip­ment.

This kind of support infrastructure is what is being made avail­able to civilians through the convergence of cell phones and the internet.

the ally

THE NATURE OF THE ALLY

The old doctors had helpers

Maybe the power plant was a conduit, or a call, a sort of whistle. Or the plant was like a delivery service. Not like the plant itself was the ally

maybe the ally lived in the plant, or maybe the ally lived in the next world, and the plant was like a bridge

That plants have virtues, or ‘vertues’, was known by the ancient herbalists. The Virtue of a plant was its truth, its strength. Maybe the best synonym is integrity. Or power. Or poison.

The ally is the one who helps you. That is what an ally should do. Allies assist each other in the prosecution of some task.

Allies may also have agendas of their own, however. That is, an ally is not like a fairy-godmother, but is a powerful force in its own right.

An ally is like a half-broken horse, a horse with spirit. A horse that will carry you many days, only to suddenly knock you off on a low branch. Some allies are the subtle type. Maybe You have an ayahuasca saly. She is friendly. She gives you things. She doesn’t seem at all malevolent. Or maybe you have an opium ally. She is more than friendly. She’ll call you up and invite you over. And she is voluptuous, so you go. She is so good to you it seems like heaven. You get what I mean.

instant tools

Aborigines have few tools or objects and rely on ‘instant tools’, that is they recognise potentially useful objects in the environment. If this object matches a ‘mental template’ or idea of a tool, for example a spear thrower, a concrete object results.

Group members share food as well as other possessions, and among aborigines articles have been traced through 134 persons. This sharing creates friendship and social values are more important than economic ones.

Hunters do not store food but regard the environment as a storehouse. While each local group is associated with a geographic range there is considerable visiting among groups which do not maintain exclusive rights to resources but have flexible arrangements. At the same time most groups have a home base or camp.

This generalised description of the way in which hunters and gatherers (including aborigenes) use space can be expressed in terms of a set of concepts derived from animal studies

Home Range – The usual limit of regular and activities, which can be defined as a set of behavioural settings and linking paths.

Core areas – Those areas within the home range which are most used and most commonly inhabited.

Territory – A particular area which is owned and defended – whether physically or through rules or symbols which identify the area of an individual or group from others.

Jurisdiction – ‘Ownership’ of a territory for a limited time only, and by some agreed rules.

Among animals the size of home range and core areas and their coincidence, and the times and duration of jurisdiction depend on the natural conditions (climate, rainfall, resources) on the one hand and the animal species on the other. In the case of hunters also the same physical factors play a role as do the values and life-style of the group.

mesh networks politics and law in software

software as constitution and law

[users]

Any piece of software has conventions and methodology that govern you while you use it. You have to work in the way the soft­ware prescribes. Hotmail conditions the way you use email. Micro­

 

soft Word conditions the way you write; it forces you to capitalise words at the beginning of sentences when you don’t want to and alters the spelling of the words you misspelled on purpose. In fact all Microsoft products condition your behaviour. They proscribe the way you carry out the task they are helping you perform. You are governed by an imposed constitution and law, by the philoso­phy of the people who wrote the software.

Software is often reconfigurable and extensible, the environment you are working in can usually be radically changed to suite the way you work. Microsoft Word for example is actually massively reconfigurable and below the surface is very powerful. In the hands of a Microsoft Word guru, Microsoft Word can do almost anything (one of the reasons why there are so many Microsoft Word viruses). Even a dumb user can stop it from correcting their spelling. But most people don’t customise their environments and live under the tyranny of the software’s defaults.

linux

In the Unix community hackers fight religious wars in defense of their prefered on screen working environments. The arguments centre on questions like whether a particular editor is less intru­sive or more flexible or powerful, and the tone of the arguments imply that using a particular editor implies an entire world view.

The arguments extend to operating systems. Being a Unix user or a Mac user or a Windows user implies differences in your whole way of life.

Beyond editors, hackers have the way they work, the way they write code, conditioned by operating systems.

Consequently we have Linux. Linux is an entirely free operat­ing system, with all of its underlying code available for anyone to peruse and hack away at. Generalising somewhat, the Linux com­munity see the collective development of Linux as a political act. Linux represents freedom from the tyranny of closed and arbitrary constitutions. The Linux community sees itself in direct opposition to the closed orthodoxy of Microsoft.

addapt

Addapt [www.addapt.org] is an experiment in developing net­worked community. Addapt was developed by Rich Persaud as generic community building software.

Each member of an addapt community has a profile. If you want to see the photo of another member you have to submit one of yourself. If you don’t submit a photo of yourself you can’t see anyone else’s, if you don’t submit a bio you can’t see anyone else’s.

You have to contribute to see what others have contributed.

No spectators.

“Chess is an example of how a fixed set of rules does not restrict freedom but rather creates freedom” Herman Hertzberger

the landmark lessig ruling

This is the final statement, at the end of the last of the P2P file sharing cases (which was presided over and concluded by Shakil Meritam, who some considered the ideal geek judge).

It was directed at artists and programmers of all kinds but specifi­cally at the 22 year old singer who had filed the prosecution case.

The summation took place in late 2005 at a point when the Lessig presidency was forcing through the fastest most far reaching legal and political transformation in American history.

Shakil, a young judge at 33, was a man who had some empathy for artists having written some really clever and much respected open source code in his younger days.

“This ruling will be hard to swallow if you were comfortable in the old world, but in the light of the recent dramatic world events and the logic of the new administration, and specifically the landmark majority verdict reached by the recently repaired Supreme Court, it’s clear that not everyone was. Let me outline where we are now with respect to this case.

It is my greatest regret that it will affect artists themselves not just the parasitic industries that have grown up around their talent. Those of you, for example, that make a living directly from writing or coding or making movies or singing,

The essence of my ruling, which follows from the technical and market realities as this court perceives them, is that you can still charge for access, and for physical things, but you cannot impose constraints on the redistribution of bits.

Also there is no change, despite the prosecutions arguments con­cerning the technical difficulties of enforcement, in the Supreme Courts caveat ruling against abuses of personal data privacy. Aggregating or redistributing pesonal data without explicit permis­sion is still unlawful.

The truth is that copyright as we used to understand it wasn’t just easier to uphold because copying was hard and distributing was easier to control, it was predicated on it. The law can only help you so far. Copyright as we used to understand it was reasoned, and in some cases reasonable, opportunism based on technologi­cal circumstances.

I have not ruled that all the ideas behind traditional copyright should be abandoned just that they should only apply where it makes technological, political, and social, sense.

I’m sorry you steal feel they stole your work, I have to confess I even have some mp3’s of your songs myself. I really like your stuff. But heres the position: I can’t allow you to invade privacy, lock everyone of us up, cripple everyones machines and remove useful functionality just so you can buy a huge condo and a pri­vate jet.

What I can do is sign you up early for the new ‘artists wage legis­lation’ that you and the recording industry are so bitterly opposed to. That legislation, as you probably know, gets users (people mostly) to register their media downloads.. Based on the down­load measure you can get paid the new ‘artists wage’ (on a sliding scale based on popularity). The system is not in place yet and It’ll be hard to do and hard to verify, but i think its going to work out fine.

 

That will give you just enough to live on, and maybe a bit more cos its you and you’re a really popular strategic propoganda asset of USA inc.

After that you might want to consider this:

I am not abolishing the market, all of the underlying principles of copyright, or money, as some old (and controlled) media head­lines have suggested.

Neither am I removing all your possible means of supporting your­self or growing wealthy.

This and the points i will now make are not facetious, they are the consensus reality my ruling subjects you to,

If you want to keep the public from just ‘stealing’ what you have and not giving anything back you will have to alter the nature of what you give them and the way you give it to them. It is my view that despite your denials you have already gone some way towards this reality.

I’ll try and give you some examples of what I am suggesting.

You could make something real and not reducable to bits (but still distributable) and make it intrinsic to your bit reducible art.

You can require or suggest real things to complete the digital experience (or become marketing material for harder to reproduce and easier to control goods) and make money that way (incidentally if you were thinking of arguing the point that logically follows that – at the point at which everything is easy to reproduce, money won’t matter so much anyway.)

What I am suggesting, you and your industry already well understand. Acknowledging these unwritten rules (not locking down copyright) will lead to innovation beyond the computer screen. That is, it will be good for the transfromation of physical reality..

To get a user to pay to view or listen, you must make your work more satisfying if viewed in a complex, hard to reproduce setting. People will pay in those circumstances. Moreover the law will back you if you ask them to pay for access and they try not to.

..that doesn’t give a license to cripple copying and distribution mechanisms (look how much good feeling that generated)

I’ll say again I can only help you protect physical things and access to streams of bits, but not the bits themselves.

You can argue as long as you like about the supposed injustice of that, but it is your reality and you must learn to live and survive in that reality.

You can still get paid. You could create an environment that is always on, ever changing and that fundamentally requires real time interaction. That is, an environment that is only relevant when connected. You could then charge people who want to be connected to your world. You can charge for an account on the server, specifically *not* the client software, or a *track* or what happened yesterday.

Offer a real time service not a dead chunk of data.

The industry that funded your appeal had an opportunity early on to build a culture of subscription for tracks and movies but you blew it for the sake of greed, and i can’t put that genie back in the bottle for you.

I ask you to think of George Lucas realising the potential for star wars toys,

Different kinds of artists and creative industries have evolved different approaches in each new creatively, technologically and legally constrained circumstance and they *must* continue to do so.

here are some of those historical, extant approaches, that prove my point about creative industries understanding these ideas prior to the new legislation:

Sell fast machines and graphics cards (video game tactic), public performances and tshirts (music tactic), big cinema + blobject + mcdonalds license (film tactic), physical books and rubber chicken circuit (author tactic), the unfeasibly huge freeway sculptures by Arnish Kapoor in LA (fine artists tactic)

Face it, you go and see ‘Lord of the Rings 4’ in a cinema because it is more satisfying than watching the DVD on your laptop, and you pay because you want to be there and they own the building.

You bought a computer because without it you couldn’t see the DVD.

You read a book cos at the moment its easier than printing out the hacked PDF

Now think of all the bands that get paid to play live and make all their money selling tshirts from a table at the back of the hall

Major commercial artists and producers already recognise this, you realise this, and you just want to get paid many times over. Which is OK in principle, but if one of those ways you want to get paid requires crippling peoples computers and slowing down the flow of digital information then that way is *not* OK.

Access rights I can enforce, privacy rights i will try and enforce, dead data redistribution rights i can’t.

I think the honest way forward isn’t crippling the machines it’s constant evolution and imaginatively binding digitised art to reality in *new* ways

In physical terms i think that means more than t-shirts.

..to be valuable within this new legal framework data can be bound to the outside, to the physical world and to the real pres­ence of the artist

From a marketing perspective companies like Nintendo already recognise this: look at their swipe card trading cards, but i’m afraid even that falls short of my ruling

Mobile computing has already opened up the possibilites and not just to marketing scams but to real innovation

Location aware games now allow locations to be critical to games and you often have to pay to get in to a game critical location.

This legislation is a carefully considered challenge to artists, The public won’t let you starve because we like your stuff (or some of us do) but i’m afraid today we want more from you.

don’t just make things reducible to dead sequences of bits

you must now take responsibility for (and the rewards that follow from) transforming physical reality, don’t just sing into a computer for three minutes about change and hope someone else does it

you’re likely to get paid if you change the outside (or force a change in our real time experience of the inside)

On your way out, remember you have a mighty and unfettered network that wants to hear and see you

and you can use that network in innovative ways that i haven’t forseen, you can also use the digital media you already know how to create, distributed free, to support your efforts to transform reality. And if it matters to you and you’re clever or you partner with the right people you could get paid a lot of money for finding a commercial interpretation of this landmark ruling.

..and finally remember that your physical presences as an artist increases in value according to the square of the number of mp3’s that people ‘steal’. It was a real buzz to spend so many weeks with you.”

headmap received this important clarification by email shortly after this was written

“note that the audience’s untilled, emotional farmland is a single-use commodity that will be recapitalized by many industries exter­nal to the “music” industry

imprinting certain songs on the brains of a teenage audience during their formative years serves as a selection mechanism for future radio stations, commercials, period movies, etc

the period of harvesting the fruit of these early seeds is when the onetime teenagers reach their early-thirties – old enough to have earning power, young enough to have disposable income (low chance of mortgages, kids, etc).

the teenagers’ attention should be treated as part of a transac­tion … companies that engage said attention are benefiting from a (re)transmission medium for which they are never billed … and can never be reused … formative memories (imprinted on virgin minds) are never lost or less intense than their successors.

songs are like links in blogs … molecules that anchor chemical reactions, given appropriate catalysis … they are chrono-emotio-spatial hash signatures by virtue of early binding to formative experiences

the limited resource, the economic resource is not the songs … it’s the formative experiences … which are being sold in an invisible transaction that commits the memory’s owner to a lifetime of sub­sequent heartstring-pulling … unpaid and involuntary.

the music industry can and does make money by selling perfor­mance rights to these songs, into infinity … even if _all_ the songs were given away for free on P2P networks … they are an anony­mous sorting mechanism … the only problem is the 17-year gap between binding the song to a memory and harvesting the dispos­able income of the memory’s owner.” Rich Persaud

social organisation

twelve principles of collaboration

12 Principles of Collaboration

[from mongoosetech.com ]

Purpose

Community exists because the members share a common purpose which can only be accomplished jointly.

Identity

Members can identify each other and build relationships.

Reputation

Members build a reputation based on the expressed opinions of others.

Governance

The facilitators and members of the community assign management duties to each other, allowing the community to grow.

Communication

Members must be able to interact with each other .

Groups

Community members group themselves according to specific interests or tasks

Environment

A synergistic environment enables community members to achieve their purpose.

Boundaries

The community knows why it exists and what or who is outside and inside.

Trust

Building trust between members and with community facilitators increases group efficiency and enables conflict resolution.

Exchange

The community recognizes forms of exchange values, such as knowledge, experience, support, barter or money .

Expression

 

The community itself has a “soul” or “personality”; members are aware of what other community members are doing.

History

The community must keep track of past events and must react and change in response to it.

heterarchy

technological constraints on organisational structure [e.g. distance and time] are changing

There is as yet no new social framework that is as interesting as technology, and ideas, now allow.

a new dominant form of social organisation

“It is the shift from hierarchy to heterarchy, which is still in progress worldwide. (“Heterarchy” was coined by early cybernetician Warren McCulloch at MIT to designate networked structures in which the center of control constantly moves to wherever is most relevant and useful; he was thinking of brain function.) At a time when the New Left was calling for grass-roots political (I.e. referred) power, Whole Earth eschewed politics and pushed grass-roots direct power – tools and skills.” Stewart Brand on founding the Whole Earth Catalog in 1968

the network is the new dominant form of social organisation

the emphasis [...] is less on the advance of technology than on the challenges for organization”

netwar is not simply a function of the Internet; it does not take place only in cyberspace or the infosphere. Some key battles may occur there, but a war’s overall conduct and outcome will normally depend mostly on what happens in the real world.”

Netwar is not Internet war.

the information revolution is not solely or mainly about technology; it is an organizational as well as a techno-logical revolution.

Consider the four major forms that, over the ages, appear to account for the organization and evolution of societies: tribes, institutions, markets, and networks (see Ronfeldt, 1996). Very different types of information – and different information cultures and strategies – pertain to each form. In the case of tribes (and clans), the most valued information is often about kinship ties; in the case of institutions, it is about the reasons for hierarchy; in markets, it is about opportunities for exchange; and, while it is still early to be sure about information-age networks, information about the capacity for team-work may be highly valued.

The rise of network forms of organization is a key consequence of the ongoing information revolution.

[Four examples of network organisation

• The chain network, as in a smuggling chain where people, goods, or information move along a line of separated contacts, and where end-to-end communication must travel through the intermediate nodes.

• The star, hub, or wheel network, as in a franchise or a cartel structure where a set of actors is tied to a central node or actor, and must go through that node to communicate and coordinate.

• The all-channel network, as in a collaborative network of militant small groups where every group is connected to every other.

Of the three network types, the all-channel has been the most difficult to organize and sustain historically, partly because it may require dense communications

In an archetypal netwar, the protagonists may consist of diverse, dispersed, often small groups (“nodes”) who share a set of ideas and interests, and agree to communicate, coordinate, and act in a highly Internetted (“all-channel”) manner. Ideally, this actor (or set of actors) has no single central leadership, headquarters, or command - no precise heart or head that can be targeted. The overall organizational design is flat and non-hierarchical - it is heterarchical, both polycephalous and acephalous. It functions as what might be termed a “panarchy” in that all members subscribe to a common doctrine that reflects their shared ideals and objectives, and guides their strategies. Tactical decision making and operations are decentralized - they may involve mutual consultation, but they emphasize local initiative.

society as shelter

“our increased dependence on technological shelter may lead to the weakening of human interdependence, which is another source of security. We should not forget that society too provides shelter, and in many cases a more flexible and effective kind.” Rosalind Williams - Notes from the Underground

domestication of grains made possible living in cities

“As ancient as wine is, however, beer is probably older, as attested by brewers Slops found on Neolithic middens. As Edgar Anderson says, man was a brewer before he was a baker. Some believe that brewing was the impetus behind the domestication of grains. The domestication of grains made possible living in cities, and it was living in cities that made possible imperialism, police, and slavery, which, in turn, led to writing, which led to, well, we all know: our present dilemma.

Ale comes from the Indo-European root alu-, relating to magic, sorcery, possesion and visions, and is cognate with our word hallucinogen”

peer to peer companies, klogs and blogcliques

here are commercial companies trawling and targeting blogs and selling what they find to corporate clients

this ultimately is one of the directions the knowledge management / klogs threads point

use the free stuff to make some money

seems like bloggers need a license or a mechanism that ensures that their writing is attributed and their contribution gets paid for if it is used in a commercial context.

ridiculously utopian to imagine everyone doing their thing, and getting paid if what they do gets exploited commercially

even so

creative commons as it stands is not enough

one alternative is companies like Sense who allow bright people to blog amongst themselves for the benefit of commercial clients

..another alternative is the decentralised company

the difference being: rather than either the suited trawlers or net­worked consultants model..

you have an active open coalition of openly (and privately) blog­ging individuals focused on a shared purpose

in the context of ‘free and open’ this is the open source model

but in a commercial context

all this feeds into the nagging feeling that variant forms of all these ideas are already well advanced

and there are some dark undertones already evident

its not a new thought that bloggers and blogrollers are the end­game in advertising

bloggers with an audience can [and to varying degrees do] sell their voices [mentioning products and individuals and compa­nies apparently in the context of a subjective open dialogue but primarilly to serve the individual, interest group or company they have a financial or other interest in serving]

this is the full on blur that guerrilla advertising seeks:

targeted advertising in the context of an apparently ‘open subjec­tive dialogue’ is heavy duty hypnotic suggestion

no need for indicators, no requirement for a break in the discourse indicating ‘advert for individual/company/ideology follows..’

its not as simple as it seems either

you want to get paid cos you’re hungry [example deleted] or you need another titanium imac [example deleted]

you want to talk in public cos you understand that you’re going to get the feedback you need to push your own ideas forward if you place them in the biggest open technically sophisticated network forum possible

so what to do?

get on with it

read critically

keep working

blogging really is doing for text and ideas what open sourcing has done for software

blogs are not just public diaries they are mechanisms for structur­ing thoughts and ideas so they can be ordered, searched, aggre­gated and trawled

look what open source (with its often contrasting and diverse motivations) has managed to drag into a world a lot of people tried to keep closed

[..but maybe think about this stuff]

..and then there’s the politics of blogcliques that coalesce and exist only to keep each other permanently overflowing with links back and forth [to be fair: often a mix of reasonable talent and machiavellian instincts]

the blogclique is disticnct from the blogroll because blogcliquer’s are making sure they all get paid and stay in the news, industry pundits, journalists, industry insiders, freeloaders and hardworkers alliied with a common goal – not to disappear from view

[begin paulo valdemarin P2P companies quote. via Ben Hammer­sley]

“Along all the .com era, all new companies that have been created were after all “traditional” companies, meaning pyramidal struc­tures with managers, employees, offices, etc.

In the last few months I have met (most of times virtually) some very smart people from all parts of the world I would like to work with: to start new projects, to create new technologies, to develop new solutions. But when I think about how this could work out, I

keep bumping in the same old “company” idea. We could work together, with the ultimate goal of creating a new company.

But is this really the way to go? With the kind of collaborative tech­nology that we have today, do we really still need companies?

Well, of course, the answer from many points of view is still yes, but it could be a whole new breed of company: a P2P company.

It could be something between a secret society, where all mem­bers are somehow guaranteed by other members and are sup­posed to help each other (of course, this should not be secret!), eBay, where everybody has a “digital reputation” (co-workers and customers commenting on different members of the group) and a true P2P network, where everybody is both a client and a server (there’s just people working together, not necessarily anybody is working for anybody else).”

“the human propensity for noticing outliers in statistically opaque data.

it turns out this is a phenonema that people who appreciate music are quite familiar with. you will be listening to a song, and then you will hear a very faint hint of a new direction in the melody – your ears amplify these outliers and soon you are waiting for it to really pick up…

the point is that it is not major trends that people necessarily listen for; but hints at novelty – and a blogging scavenging busi­ness would likely do quite well… could affiliate with some of the venture capital firms, and make strong efforts to make people aware that they will be credited for their concepts.

howard rheingold barcode observation

“My friend Marc Smith, a sociologist-geek who works for Microsoft Research, has connected an inexpensive barcode scanner to a handheld computer with a wireless connection, and has installed code that connects the info returned from the universal product code database to the Google search engine. The UPC database provides salient information about the product linked to a bar code. It’s all part of AURA , a research project to explore ubiquitous computing using off-the-shelf technology. People who register at the site can send their scans . and their comments on their scans . to a website. Their comments thus turn up within days, open to everyone with Google access, as results of keyword searches relevant to the scanned object.

So what does that mean in practice? I went in his kitchen and scanned the first two objects I found . a box of prunes and a box of breakfast cereal. Then I googled the names of the products and the names of their vendors, as revealed by the barcodes. The first link to the prune growers , the Sun-Diamond Growers cooperative of California , was to a political polemic about “Bromide Barons attempting to undermine the democratic process with their financial influence.” The “Corpwatch” was clearly a political group with an agenda. However, the second link revealed the syllabus of a Supreme Court decision against Sun-Diamond ; the first line of the syllabus states: “Respondent trade association was charged with violating, inter alia, 18 U.S.C. ¤ 201(c)(1)(A), which prohibits giving .anything of value. to a present, past, or future public official .for or because of any official act performed or to be performed by such public official..” I

Amazing! But perhaps an anomaly. The second item I scanned, however, was “Kellogg’s Cracklin Oat Bran.” The first entry in Google’s list of links was headlined: “Kellogg USA Issues Allergy Alert on Undeclared Eggs, Milk, Soybeans, or Almonds in Kellogg’s® Cracklin’ Oat Bran® and Kellogg’s® Smart Start® Cereals.” Talk about your sentient things! As Marc says, “every thing has a story.”

Labels on products reflect political decisions, often influenced by enormous economic forces. Witness the current battles over labelling foods that contain genetically-modified organisms. A product label is a closed system. The barcode, which links products to the machines that sort, track, and organize the distribution of the products, is connected to another closed system, the UPC database, which is open to public inspection but not public modification. However, when you apply Google searches to the information returned from the UPC database, the closed system is pried open by its connection to a vast open system of documents, links, comments, and debates from public records, websites, and usenet postings. Citizens and consumers have been relatively powerless in regard to influencing the kind and amount of information revealed on product labels. A few off-the-shelf technologies, costing a few hundred dollars, some custom code, and a universally available web utility, threatens to upset this crucial balance of information-power.

‘We are interested to study emergent individual and group behaviors associated with the ability to digital tag objects and places. In our system, a user can associate text, threaded conversations, audio, images, video or other data with a specific tag. Users can review the tags they have encountered and annotated in a custom web portal. Optionally, they can opt to have their comments be posted onto newsgroups. This allows search engines to index and essentially publish the association to other users. Physical annotations can be shared with other users and be rated by the users. reputation statistics. ‘”

corporations as robots

Corporations are created by humans to further the goal of making money. As Buckminster Fuller said in his brilliant essay The Grunch of Giants, “Corporations are neither physical nor metaphysical phenomena. They are socioeconomic ploys – legally enacted game-playing…”

Corporations are non-living, non-breathing, legal fictions. They feel no pain. They don’t need clean water to drink, fresh air to breathe, or healthy food to consume. They can live forever. They can’t be put in prison. They can change their identity or appearance in a day, change their citizenship in an hour, rip off parts of themselves and create entirely new entities. Some have compared corporations with robots, in that they are human creations that can outlive individual humans, performing their assigned tasks forever.

Isaac Asimov, when considering a world where robots had become as functional, intelligent, and more powerful than their human creators, posited three fundamental laws that would determine the behavior of such potentially dangerous human-made creations. His Three Laws of Robotics stipulated that non-living human creations must obey humans yet never behave in a way that would harm humans.

Asimov’s thinking wasn’t altogether original: Thomas Jefferson and James Madison beat him to it by about 200 years.

Jefferson and Madison proposed an 11th Amendment to the Constitution that would “ban monopolies in commerce,” making it illegal for corporations to own other corporations, banning them from giving money to politicians or trying to influence elections in any way, restricting corporations to a single business purpose, limiting the lifetime of a corporation to something roughly similar to that of productive humans (20 to 40 years back then), and requiring that the first purpose for which all corporations were created be “to serve the public good.”

The amendment didn’t pass because many argued it was unnecessary: Virtually all states already had such laws on the books from the founding of this nation until the Age of the Robber Barons.

..from a recent article by Thom Hartmann

community

community can be seen in the context of families, tribes, coun­tries, federations of countries, continents, or a commonly held idea. Commercial, military and political units can be thought of as separate to or bound up with the communities they serve or are aligned to.

..what constitutes a community is a classification problem

classification

..evolutionary biology really began as a science concerned with classification from Aristotle’s legacy. What is so beautiful today, is that the whole thing is being turned on its head. All of a sudden, evolutionary biologists, particularly those concerned with more theoretical work, are questioning our ability to define, name, or classify even the most fundamental things. For example, there are at least a dozen different species concepts in use. Systemetists [biologists concerned with classifying living organisms] cannot even agree on what a species is. And this is not because they are being limited or petty. It is because, knowing what we know about the world today, there is a philosophical problem with deciding where to draw species borders. You may disagree and argue that a lion is clearly different than a bobcat so that the argument must be purely theoretical. However, there are such practical concerns that come out of the species concept debate that it is impossible to dismiss it as a purely philosophical concern. The most important application of this work is in the area of conservation biology – where it is essential to come to some consensus about what is or is not actually unique and worth protecting. [This gets into a bunch of other things. One is about whether we should be protecting genetic or morphological diversity [a discussion that didn’t exist 50 years ago]. The other is about how we make sense of the fact that human and chimp genomes are only 5% different while identical looking salamander species have more than 14% divergence. I’ll spare you the details because I’m already rambling.]””There are a bunch of central dichotomies which evolutionary biologists are working through. I won’t give specific example for each now, but they give rise to very practical issues [in addition to the theoretical]. I list them for you just to illustrate that I think evolutionary biology can act as quite a bridge between technology and philosophy. Erica Rosenblum

Security and privacy through encryption should arguably be discussed in terms of a right rather than as a feature (hotmail etc. should be private and secure).

As borders and boundaries become a principal concern of real communities, so encryption is becoming a concern for networked communities. As mobile devices evolve to the point where they are by default broadcasting your location at any given moment, encryption becomes a clear synonym for security and privacy. Encryption will be a defining factor in the evolution of new forms of spatialised networked community.

“’The mandarins draw their power from the law; the people from the secret societies.’ — Chinese saying

[secret societies in software]

Last winter I read a book on the Chinese Tongs (Primitive Revolutionaries of China: A Study of secret Societies in the Late Nineteenth Century, Fei-Ling Davis; Honolulu, 1971- 77): – maybe the first ever written by someone who wasn’t a British Secret Service agent! – (in fact, she was a Chinese socialist who died young – this was her only book) – & for the first time I realized why I’ve always been attracted to the Tong: not just for the romanticism, the elegant decadent chinoiserie decor, as it were – but also for the form, the structure, the very essence of the thing.

Some time later in an excellent interview with William Burroughs in Homocore magazine I discovered that he too has become fascinated with Tongs & suggests the form as a perfect mode of organization for queers, particularly in this present era of shitheel moralism & hysteria. I’d agree, & extend the recommendation to all marginal groups, especially ones whose jouissance involves illegalism (potheads, sex heretics, insurrectionists) or extreme eccentricity (nudists, pagans, post-avant-garde artists, etc., etc.).

A Tong can perhaps be defined as a mutual benefit society for people with a common interest which is illegal or dangerously marginal – hence, the necessary secrecy. Many Chinese Tongs revolved around smuggling & tax-evasion, or clandestine self-control of certain trades (in opposition to State control), or insurrectionary political or religious aims (overthrow of the Manchus for example – several tongs collaborated with the Anarchists in the 1911 Revolution).

A common purpose of the tongs was to collect & invest membership dues & initiation fees in insurance funds for the indigent, unemployed, widows & orphans of deceased members, funeral expenses, etc. In an era like ours when the poor are caught between the cancerous Scylla of the insurance industry & the fast-evaporating Charybdis of welfare & public health services, this purpose of the Secret Society might well regain its appeal. (Masonic lodges were organized on this basis, as were the early & illegal trade unions & “chivalric orders’ for laborers & artisans.)

Another universal purpose for such societies was of course conviviality, especially banqueting – but even this apparently innocuous pastime can acquire insurrectionary implications. In the various French revolutions, for example, dining clubs frequently took on the role of radical organizations when all other forms of public meeting were banned.”

real communities brought together or sustained by the net

People find themselves bringing their network life into their real life.

 

conferences as temporary communities

conferences are a part of a lot of people’s lives. They represent the artificial physical convergence of an often internationally dis­persed group that share a common interest.

Conferences are slightly weird and dislocated. Kind of like they’re not supposed to be happening.

They are a model for the idea of building your community around common interest rather than proximity or pre-existent relations and then managing to drag that community into the same room.

new architecture

reality augmented

In real space, outside, people will soon find their worlds radically reinterpreted and augmented by a new generation of wireless networked location aware devices.

 

Location awareness will change the way people relate to the space, orientate them in that space, and help them find what they need.

It is now possible (and it will become progressively easier) to invisibly mark, demarcate and annotate real spaces. This makes possible a new architecture.

path and place

[EDGES]

J.G. Davies states that ‘most buildings belong to either the category of path or that of a place, the one suggesting journey and movement , the other a centre and stillness … between these two main categories there are structures that combine features of both: such are paths that lead to and include places, the latter acting as foci or nodes.’

[Lynch states] ‘For a path to be identifiable, it must have strong edges; continuity; directionality; recognisable landmarks a sharp terminal; and end-from-end distinction.’

Davies goes on to define place as ‘a readily comprehensible shape’ that possesses a discernable and ‘concentrated’ form with ‘pronounced borders.’ The place needs to be ‘limited in size,’ ‘capable of being experienced as an inside in contrast to the surrounding exterior; largely non-directional’ and to provide a ‘focus for gathering’.

“all architecture is a structuring of space by means of a goal or path” Dagoburt Frey.

Norberg-Schulz also references Lynch and lists his own terms regarding path and place: “directions or paths”, “centres or places” and “areas or domains”

Moreover, paths represent the willful leaving of one place and a journey to another

He cites the cosmogonic implications the path and place have held for ancient societies; the centre or place representing the centre of the world and the path leading away from this;

“the way is always directed from the known to the unknown.”

“man is both centre bound and horizon bound” Aldo van Eyck

real space [outside versus inside] [augmenting reality vs simulating it]

So far computers have kept people indoors sitting in front of screens. The latest stage in computer evolution will see the next generation of kids running through the space with networked location aware computers [with short acronyms] strapped to them. These devices will make the space more interesting as they run, issuing instructions like Get to the end of the road and climb on the roof of the deserted cinema (for some unspecified future net­worked game related purpose).

Computer games that use and augment real space will probably result in a few deaths but at least it’ll get kids out of the house and running around climbing things.

Augmentation is about to become a more interesting mass market problem than pure simulation. The market is orders of magnitude larger than the ghetto that is 3d gaming.

A range of new conceptual and design related problems are implied by augmenting real space.

Many of the more interesting augmentation problems relate to building new spaces and reinterpreting old ones.

Arguably these are problems for architects.

More likely they are problems for kids. If kids get there hands on these devices and prove receptive to them, then just by watch­ing how they use them, it will become apparent what the devices are capable of and to what unforeseen uses that can be put.

abstraction and empty space

A bald patch of grass on Wimbledon common may become impor­tant to some as yet non-existent community, and even as the community grows in size and importance, it may be unnecessary to build anything on that spot to emphasis its collective importance either to the community itself or to other communities.

Imagine if there were no billboards, no one wore bright colors or fashionable clothes, the buildings were all spartan and utilitarian, there were no street signs, none of the houses had numbers, and shops had no shopfronts just doors. The entire life of the culture not visible without some kind of technological augmentation. All colour and information was invisible to the naked eye.

city images

“There seems to be a public image of any given city which is the overlap of many individual images. Or perhaps there is a series of public images, each held by some significant number of citizens. Such group images are necessary if an individual is to operate successfully within his environment and to cooperate with his fellows. Each individual picture is unique, with some content that is rarely or never communicated, yet it approximates the

 

public image, which, in different environments, is more or less compelling, more or less embracing.

[...]

[mental maps of spaces]

the closer he looks, the more vague and smudged it all becomes

[...]

These environments are not only highly meaningful, but their image is a vivid one.

Certain holy areas may become very highly charged, so that there is a strong focusing of attention, a fine differentiation of parts, a high density of names. The Athenian Acropolis, saturated with a long cultural and religious history, was evidently named and parceled to the gods small area by small area, almost stone by stone, making renovations extremely difficult. The Emily Gap, a small gorge 100 yards long by 30 yards wide in the MacDonnell ranges of central Australia, is to the native people a veritable gallery of legendary locations. In Tikopia, the Marae, a sacred cleared space in the forest was used ritually only once a year. It was a small rectangle, yet contained over twenty locations with regular fixed names. Among more advanced Cultures an entire city may be holy, such as Meshed in Iran, or Lhasa in Tibet. These cities are full of names and memories, distinctive forms, and holy places.

[...]

there is a pleasant sense of familiarity or rightness in a recognised landscape. The Netsilik Eskimo put this well-worn idea in their own way: “to be surrounded by the smell of ones own things”

[...]

Indeed the very naming and distinguishing of the environment vivifies it, and thereby adds to the depth and poetry of the human experience.

[...]

[Florence] Progressive house numbering was introduced in 1808, and the city shifted over to reference by paths.

aborigines

Aborigines, choose not to reshape the land in the ways that other cultures tend to, and instead rely on and interact with an incred­ibly complex internalised map of their environment, one that is extended through a shared oral tradition of mapping through song, the mapping having application to religious and spiritual practice, territorial boundaries, and practical requirements for food, water and shelter.

wayfinding

Field biologists are tagging and tracking all manner of species, mapping Monarch butterflies as they all head down to Mexico from Canada and then turn left to converge on a specific spot.

They speculate that whales are telling stories to the younger whales to help them as they migrate across vast stretches of ocean.

Analysis of dolphin communication based on techniques derived from information theory show that in dolphin dolphin interactions, the amount of information that can be or is being transferred, the bandwidth, is far higher than speech based human to human communication.

Whales and dolphins and chimpanzees don’t expend enormous effort building houses and reshaping and marking their external environment

Having a sophisticated model of territory, physical and social, and using that model in a sophisticated way does not necessarily require you to mark or alter it.

Humans appear to be on the verge of transferring much of the information that they had previously physically engraved directly onto the environment, into a more abstract and invisible form.

If marking is a question of degree, then moving a large part of the information people have become accustomed to physically attach­ing to the space into portable devices represents a definite shift in the balance.

the discovery of culture in other animals

“If culture is defined by socially (as opposed to genetically) transmitted habits and knowledge, so that one group may develop quite different ways of doing things from another group of the same species, It is widespread indeed.” Frans de Waal

brutus

Brutus was the leader of a community of eighty chimpanzees. Like other communities, parties of around ten would go off in search of food, often travelling in one direction for hours in silence. These travelling parties would keep in touch by pant-hooting and by drumming on trees with buttresses, which are very resonant and can be heard for thousands of metres through the forest. Boesch noticed that sometimes after he had heard drumming, all the parties in the community would change direction. Many months of patiently following the community made Boesch realize that it was only when Brutus was drumming that the community changed direction. Analysis of the drumming and the reactions to it led Boesch, a famously careful researcher, to the astonishing conclusion that Brutus was signalling to his community in a ‘symbolic drumming code’ based on the number of drumbeats. Brutus conveyed three completely specific messages:

1. Drumming once at two different trees indicated the direction he was proposing, which was the direction followed by Brutus when moving between the two drummed trees.

2. Drumming twice at the same tree meant rest for an hour. The community activity stopped for an average of 60 minutes. In twelve observed instances, the rest was never less than 55 minutes and never more than 65 minutes. Once Boesch observed Brutus drumming four times on the same tree, and the party

 

rested for 2 hours!

3. Drumming once at one tree and twice on another tree meant change direction to the one proposed, and then rest for an hour.’

For this form of communication to work, Brutus and other members must be able to use their numerical capacity to distinguish 1, 1 from 2 from 1, 2. This code is only found in this one community in the Tai Forest: it was part of their culture and no one else’s. I say ‘was’ because Brutus has now stopped using the code. Poaching, the greatest threat to chimpanzee survival, has killed or kidnapped so many prime males that the number of travel parties has since declined dramatically.

the mathematical brain by Brian Butterworth, papermac 1999

the landscape serves as a vast mnemonic system [and plays a social role]

Way-finding is the original function of the environmental image, and the basis on which its emotional associations may have been founded. But the image is valuable not only in this immediate sense in which it acts as a map for the direction of movement; in a broader sense as a general frame of reference within which the individual can act, or to which he can attach his knowledge. In this way it is like a body of belief, or set of social customs: it is an organiser of facts and possibilities.

[...]

At other times, distinguishing and patterning the environment may be a basis for the ordering of knowledge. Rattray speaks with great admiration of the Ashanti medicine men who strove to know every plant, animal, and insect in their forests by name, and to understand the spiritual properties of each. They were able to “read” their forests as a complex and ever-unfolding document.

The landscape plays a social role as well. The named environment, familiar to all, furnishes material for common memories and symbols which bind the group together and allow them to communicate with one another. The landscape serves as a vast mnemonic system for the retention of group history and ideals

[...]

[Sapir] He goes on to note that the characteristic Indian vocabulary does not contain the English lumping-word, “weeds,” but has separate terms for these sources of food arid medicine, terms which for each species distinguish whether the specimen is raw or cooked, as well is its color and stage of growth: as in the English calf, cow, bull, veal, and beef.

Yung makes an interesting reference to a trained geologist who was able to march unhesitatingly through foggy alpine country, simply by recognition of the patterning of the geologic type of the exposed rocks.

mental maps

People build complex internalised mental maps of the spaces they live in.

If a boy or a girl needs to get home late at night they have paths and places, boundaries and borders in their heads, relating not just to the bare facts of the space, but linked to other factors such as, what and where they consider safe.

So much of persons map of a space is influenced by, imposed cultural associations, territorial associations, what they need to get done, and past experience. The space itself serves to inform and trigger these associations intentionally or unintentionally.

If these individual internal maps could be formalised, externalised, shared and collectively extended..

..it would radically change the way people relate, both to the space around them and the people around them.

[mine human geography, anthropology, psychology and biology for these maps]

Tony Hiss in ‘the experience of place’ notes the inertia inherent in internal image of the external environment; the internal model only changes if we are aware that a change has occurred. It is now possible exists to digitally link these subjective maps and feed­back changes to individual.

pilgrim

[MYTH]

Levi Strauss held that the underlying structure of myth was consistent [something that could be proved with diagrams...]

Architecture as built myth

The hero departs, passes through a number of trials, attains the goal or destination, and returns spiritually transformed.

[...]

the hero [pilgrim] retreats… “…from the world scene of secondary effects to those causal zones of the psyche where the difficulties really exist … His second solemn task and deed therefore … is to return then to us, transfigured, and teach the lesson he has learned of life renewed.” Joseph Campbell

The hero’s journey is characterised by the sequence of ‘separation, initiation, and return,’ in which the pilgrim experiences a rite of passage and emerges, in most cases, spiritually transformed.

According to Eliade, in traditional societies if a man or woman is to become ‘complete’, they must be born for a second time. ‘Access to spiritual life always entails death to the profane condition, followed by a new birth.’ Ones childlike self dies and one returns as an adult. Initiatory rites typically perform the function of a rite of passage from one mode of being to another.

“I want to depart from here today and achieve the deathless state” [The Buddha leaves home]

..death and a journey to the underworld are a common mythological theme..

The rite of pilgrimage, analogous to the spiritual journey, is found in all the world’s major religions. [an integral part of christianity, islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism]

The act of pilgrimage has always centred on the individual.

Richard Barber cites anthropological studies that suggest pilgrimage replaced initiation rites of traditional societies, of which preparation, separation, and return in a changed state are an essential part.

The goal [of the pilgrimage], the sacred place, through its architecture, often created a microcosm of the pilgrimage. An internalised world was created in which the pilgrim’s journey is reenacted in the architectural setting ø the spiritual path and place.

wooden cathedrals

[stone cathedrals made of wood]

“First of all, wood was the foundation of its building.

All the elaborate masonry forms were dependent upon the work of the carpenter: it was not merely that the piers themselves, in the later gothic construction, resembled

tree trunks laced together

or that

the filtered light within the church had the dimness of the forest,

while the effect of the bright glass was like that of the blue sky or a sunset seen through the tracery of branches:

the fact is that none of this construction was possible without an elaborate falsework of wood: nor without wooden cranes and windlasses could the stones have been conveniently raised the necessary heights.”

Lewis Mumford

ritual

[RITUAL]

The sacred place is a place apart, separated from the profane world

a place where God or gods are worshiped and rituals enacted.

Examples range from a simple clearing in the forest to complex architectural settings.

an ‘axis mundi’, a place where the three regions of the world ø heaven, earth, and the underworld ø were joined.

Consequently, it was a place where communication with God was possible, as we find in the dream of Jacob at Bethel, where there is a ladder ascending to heaven and the voice of the Lord offers prophecies. “How awesome this place!” says Jacob upon awakening. “This is none other than the house of God and this is the gate of heaven” (Gen. 18.17)

The path to the sacred place [...] often recreates the pilgrim’s journey and its three components of preparation, separation and return. Typically, there is a delineation of entry, a place of decision as to whether to start the journey or not. This threshold also establishes what may be the first of many points of separation between the sacred and the profane, and generally involves some kind of ritualistic shedding of the outside world, as in ablution. The entrance gains access to the path or to an entire enclosed sacred precinct. Typically following the entrance, there is a sequence of defined spaces, places, or events along the path that grow increasingly more sacred, often including a number of choices. A spatial sequence provides a symbolic narrative as one travels along it and increasingly anticipates the arrival at and attainment of the sacred place.

The sacred place shares similar qualities, such as a clearly defined entry or threshold to the inner sanctum, which performs

 

functions similar to the entrance to the path. The sacred place itself is a clearly defined enclosure that has precise boundaries and is separated from the outside profane world.

“Public architecture at best aspires to be just this: a setting for the ritual that makes of each user, for a brief moment, a larger person than he or she is in daily life” Spiro Kostof

a symbolic narrative facilitated by the architectural setting

“a ritual is an enactment of myth” Joseph Campbell

Rituals also symbolises a return to promordial time or ‘in illo tempore’ the Golden Age, a time when the gods were present and the religious myths were initially enacted. Similar to sacred space, sacred time is perceived as an interval in the surrounding profane time.”

The place took the form of increasingly enclosed and sacred places, culminating in the dense, dark, and small inner sanctum

synaesthesia through augmentation

Augmented senses combined with synaesthetic inter­faces may mean you can see the phone ring or the temperature change.

simulation and augmentation

There are new companies that specialise in simu­lating real world physics on low-end platforms.

Made up primarily of postgraduate mathematicians and physicists rather than game hackers, they simulate rigid body dynamics, cloth, smoke and fluids. They can breathe life into the sterile jointed wireframe shapes that are produced by 3d modeling packages, making 3D game worlds more lifelike.

[Beyond this, in the longer term, physics models may help you judge the best moment to cross the road or make it harder to crash your car. Tomorrow’s augmenting devices may well be 3d capable. 3d models of critical systems (like the engine of your car) may overlay your view of the real mechanism.]

A-life, AI and autonomous agent research is providing creatures of varying intelligence and behaviour to inhabit rich 3d space.

Current 3d capable game consoles, as well as the machines that Sony and Microsoft already plan to replace them with, are fast enough to simulate a very high level of realism and natural behav­iour in real time.

Cheap high bandwidth internet connections, both wireless and cable, are now available to the consumer mass markets of Europe and America.

Even without these advances internet users have already become used to multi-user 3d gaming over networks.

People will inhabit rich and lifelike 3d environments in gaming and other contexts.

Companies have developed high-resolution retinal displays. These displays use lasers to project an image directly onto the retina. These devices overlay computer generated images onto real spaces. Retinal displays small enough to clip on to a pair of glasses will soon be mass market products.

All the creatures, tools and techniques of 3d gaming and simula­tion can find there way into the real space.

[You can already play quake in real spaces]

The future looks likely to see reality ever more accurately simu­lated, and that simulation looks likely to find a way into real life.

storytelling

Kris Griffith of Io research in san francisco and Fiona Raby at the RCA in London, are both architects who have found themselves designing interfaces for location aware devices. In separate conversations they both focused on the storytelling possibilities of location aware devices.

On one level storytelling is a good metaphor for thinking about both the way people move through space, and the capacity to influence their movements. On another more literal level, through location aware games, users can become characters in collective stories that unfold as people get close to one another, or move to and through particular spaces.

Location awareness also adds another dimen­sion to the patchwork built up from surveillance camera footage, click history, credit card stubs, camcorder footage, phone conversations etc. ..you could tell the story of someones ordinary day using all this stuff

..spatial maps of films: where do the characters go? ..do they stay in a confined area or travel (linear or circular?)

dunne and raby

In san francisco and silicon valley hackers sit on roofs and in car parks and and use wireless ethernet cards and laptops to find their way on to the wireless networks of companies close by. That this happens points out a kind of weird blindness by the compa­nies to the spatial nature of their networks ..they are not thinking that these networks map spatially in a new way.

Fiona Raby and her partner Tony Dunne have worked on map­ping electromagentic fields onto space. The maps they create link directly to location awareness when this idea is applied to cell phone towers. The tower a cell phone is using at any given moment roughly indicates a users position in space. The cover­age area of a tower is affected by factors such as distance from the tower and whether there are buildings between the tower and the user. The buildings create shadows which diminish coverage; so that in urban environments with a lot of buildings there is a far higher density of cell phone towers than in non-urban environ­ments. The spatial footprint of a cell phone tower is different in urban and non-urban environments.

 

According to Raby people actually pull the cell they are using with them until another cell becomes sufficiently strong to take over ..this makes for beautiful fluid visualisations..

artist engineering

“The artist of the late medieval period and the Renaissance was, also, the architect and engineer of his day and so necessarily mathematically inclined. Businessmen, secular priests, and ecclesiastical officials assigned all construction problems to the artist. He designed and built churches, hospitals, palaces, cloisters, bridges, fortresses, drawings of such engineering projects are in da Vinci’s notebooks and he, himself, in offering his services to Ludovico Sforza, ruler of Milan, promised to serve as an engineer, constructor of military works, and designer of war machines, as well as architect, sculptor and painter. The artist was even expected to solve problems involving the motion of canon balls in artillery fire, a task which in those times called for profound mathematical knowledge.” [lost the reference]

walk home

The balancing of the natural and the human-made, the forest and the path, the dark with the light, the compressed with the open, suggests the harmony that geomancy sought to attain. The path to the subtemple also describes a journey from yin to yang, the taoist principle so influential in Zen. The dark, earthy path through the forest yielding to the light, human-made environment of the dojo. Both elements were balanced, creating Harmonious environment ø earth balanced with sky.

Thomas Barrie – ‘spiritual path, sacred place’ Shambhala

magical associations can inhibit if they lack flexibility

The creation of the environmental image is a two-way process between observer and observed, What he sees is based on exterior form, but how he interprets and organizes this, and how he directs his attention, in its turn affects what he sees. The human organism is highly adaptable and flexible, and different groups may have widely different images of the same outer reality.

[...]

A landscape loaded with magical meanings may inhibit practical activities, The Arunta face death rather than move to a more favorable area. The ancestral grave-mounds in China occupy desperately needed arable land, and among the Maori some of the best landing-places are forbidden because of their mythical import. Exploitation is more easily accomplished where there is no sentiment about the land. Even conservative use of resources may be impaired where habitual orientation does not allow easy adaptation to new techniques and needs.

[...]

If it is desirable that an environment evoke rich, vivid images, it is also desirable that these images be communicable and adaptable to changing practical needs, and that there can develop new groupings, new meanings, new poetry. The objective might be an imageable environment which is at the same time open-ended. [...]

definition of architecture

“Architecture: from the Latin -teks – To weave (as a net); also to fabricate, a root shared with text, textile, context, subtle (“the finest thread of the weave”) and technology. More especially, to build a dwelling, with tools.”

American Heritage Dictionary

a new form of parasitic architecture [augmentation as]

Soft augmentation, the ability to annotate and bound real spaces without physically altering them, is a new variant form of parasitic architecture. A structure that is dependent upon and augments an existing structure can be classified as parasitic architecture.

optimism in architecture

Architecture is less and less about buildings, but can continue to be about our relationship to real space.

human beings are nomadic at a very fundamental level

the act of ritual is symbolised by path and goal

ebb and flow and local routing

A central idea in human culture is the journey. A journey is a fundamental way in which we relate to space. We move from one place to another in a linear sequence. The idea of the journey is central to our myths and stories, it is encoded in our architec­ture and implied in our built environment, the streets outside our houses, the paths through the woods, the networks of freeways, the railway tracks through our towns, the airports on the outskirts of every city, the ports distributed along every coast.

These paths serve a logistic purpose, to move people and to move things. We can choose to stay relatively still and things will find there way to our communities. But even this stasis still involves journeys; to work, to school, to shop, to the next room.

Novels are linear jouneys, but even in a medium like the internet this linear idea persists, the way you experience hypertext is linear too, it just doesn’t constrain the way you navigate.

Human beings have limited ability to multitask, at least at a conscious level (Distraction), so that each shift in our attention aggregated becomes a journey.

mnemonic architectures

“You are here – a virtual somewhere possessing an identifiable (interiorized) form and mnemonic associations by which you have arrived, will leave, and (may) navigate to return. Functionally similar mnemonic architectures have existed for almost two thousand years,”

Darrel Berry, The Poetics of Cyberspace

psychological projection [its not really there]

Architecture projects meaning onto space through physical restructuring of our environment.

What if the same principles could be applied without remodelling the space, if path could be implied without a sequence of real col­umns, a sacred space could be implied without a real perimeter.

sacred space

A place in a local park or an arbitrary piece of sidewalk could be become a meeting place or a sacred space with meaning overlaid but invisible.

a locus is a place easily grasped by the memory

“A locus is a place easily grasped by the memory, such as a house, an intercolumnar space, a corner, an arch or the like.”

Darrel Berry, The Poetics of Cyberspace

the new world

“on the one hand he shared the practicality of the English school [...] on the other hand, he was imbued with the nonsense of hermetic philosophy.”

A.L. Rowse on Elizabethan mathematician John Dee

voyages of discovery

“The opening of the ‘new’ world was conceived from the start as an occultist operation. The magus John Dee, spiritual advisor to Elizabeth I, seems to have invented the concept of ‘magical imperialism’ and infected an entire generation with it. Halkyut and Raleigh fell under his spell, and Raleigh used his connections with the ‘School of Night’ a cabal of advanced thinkers, aristocrats, and adepts to further the causes of exploration, colonization and mapmaking. ‘The Tempest’ was a propaganda-piece for the new ideology, and the Roanoke Colony was its first showcase experiment.”

Hakim Bey

voyages, navigation and the extension of knowledge

“there was a close and continuing dialectic between the voyages and the extension of knowledge.”

A.L. Rowse

new worlds inspire hope and new ways of thinking

Virginia was conceived of along utopian lines

New worlds inspire hope and new ways of thinking. Voyages of discovery force advances in the technology required for such endeavours (navigation, map making etc.). If new worlds actu­ally appear, there qualities, there character and evidence of there existence affect the society which initiated the voyages, in intel­lectual and material ways.

The internet can be read as a new world and a new frontier, sub­ject to reports from settlers, evidence of its existence (webvans etc.), land grabs and economic and social impact.

New ways of seeing the world can be analogous to new worlds.

‘for a ship does not go into the seas of the opposite south without bringing back to the courts or academies evidence of those worlds.’

Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie

memory maps and symbol systems [organising and structuring]

organising and structuring through externalised interior constructs

memory, symbol systems and architecture

most architectures exhibit both process and mnemonic aspects

“A mnemonic architecture facilitates memory and desire, a cluster which seeks to cluster. A process architecture provides access to tools. Most architectures exhibit both process and mnemonic aspects, either together, or in varying spatial and temporal aspects – this shelter from the rain, this arbour in which I dream.”

Darrell Berry – The Poetics of Cyberspace

physical buildings function on many levels

Architecture is about utility, Corbusier contended that living spaces should be machines for living in.

Physical buildings function on many levels, and utility should be broadly defined: symbolic, narrative, mnemonic and aesthetic.

Buildings can be symbols of power, authority and permanence. Buildings prescribe journeys which you have to take in order to transition from one space to another. They can encode and refer­ence ideas and function. They can be beautiful.

clay grahams symbolic arrays

“A church is an excellent example of this, a symbolic array is created where the interaction between the symbols in that array holds greater value than the essence of any one of the symbols within that matrix.”

Clay Graham

a cathedral is a symbolic clearing in the woods

A cathedral is a symbolic clearing in the woods, sunlight through the tracery in the stained glass emulating light through branches. The columns are high and, like trees, arching up and spreading out. Ritual, symbolism, metaphor, mnemonic function converge in what were key medieval centers of power and administration.

using archetypes to convey the purpose of a space

Virtual Architecture uses archetypes to convey the purpose of the space. Archetypes are a low-level symbolic language, understood to be at the base of the human psyche, which the virtual architect uses to encode meaning. Ten archetypes are as follows:

AXIS: Infers a path to a goal and begs to be followed.

COURT: The focus of action/inaction and cognitive awareness, a container of thresholds.

RELATIONSHIP OF PATH AND PLACE: The journey begins at the first threshold (initiation) and ends at the final threshold (enlightenment)

PERIMETER OF DOMAIN: The limit of understanding, the limit of the defined world.

PORTAL: A breach in the perimeter: the mouth of an axis connecting two domains.

OPENNESS AND CLOSURE: Defined by the perimeter, openness is the lack of understanding and closure is the comfortable area of knowledge.

DATUM: Spatial datum defines the scale and perimeter of the space; secondary datum may define items of interaction and is offset to show importance.

COLUMN: defines the perimeter and sets the vertical scale.

WALL: The primary method of defining the perimeter; also provides closure and clarifies breaches or portals.

ROOF: Preserves the relationship of sky and ground and provides the elevation boundary for the area of interactivity

David Frerichs describes Clay Graham’s archetypal paradigm

temporary architecture

Architecture serves to organise and focus all the appropriate sym­bols, meanings, and functionality that the proposed purpose of the building dictates.

Qualified architects are already finding themselves in many other roles aside from pure builders of buildings. Interface design, web­site design, building temporary structures for transient events like festivals, conferences and trade shows, 3d design for computer games and simulation.

As the networked world becomes increasing overlaid upon, and integrated with, the real world, the new concept of augmented space will offer opportunities for redefining the boundaries of architecture.

Imagine if there were no billboards, no one wore bright colors or fashionable clothes, the buildings were all spartan and utilitarian, there were no street signs, none of the houses had numbers, and shops had no shopfronts just doors. The entire life of the culture not visible without some kind of technological augmentation. All colour and information was invisible to the naked eye.

Burning Man enforces a no money rule, no advertising, no specta­tors. When I was there in 1999, despite 25,000 people turning up, there were no concessions, no logos, no labels, no billboards. All the infrastructure and actual structures were temporary, including the airport and the 27 radio stations. The only food you had was what you hauled in from the outside or what you bartered for, and the only thing in the whole place you could buy was coffee or juice (carrot, apple and ginger). Weirdly enough this regime significantly and positively changed the atmosphere relative to analogous big gatherings. One guy came into a camp I was visiting and tried to exchange large amounts of drugs for a little food and something to drink, (an indication of value shifting in this artificial economy).

Symbol systems extend to the extreme utility of coherent address­ing, the numbering of houses, the naming of streets, the boundary markers that define villages, towns and districts.

In japan the streets are not numbered according to the western convention of beginning at the start of a block and increasing as you walk. They are numbered according to the age of the building, the oldest build­ing is the first. So if someone gives you an address that just states the street name and number it is effectively useless. Cell phones are essential if you want to find your way to an address you haven’t been to before.

Symbol systems can extend beyond conventional boundaries. symbols of approval and disapproval, support and opposition, descriptions of function and ritual attached to any arbitrary space, bespoke paths for individuals and communities parasitic on aggregated conventional common paths. Bespoke numbering and addressing systems.

The way the space is navigated, valued, and understood will change in the face of augmentation technologies.

the myths and rites constitute a mesocosm, a mediating, middle cosmos

“And if we now try to convey in a sentence the sense and meaning of all the myths and rituals that have sprung from this conception of a universal order, we may say that they are structuring agents, functioning to bring the human order into accord with the celestial. ‘Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.’ The myths and rites constitute a mesocosm – a mediating, middle cosmos, through which the microcosm of the individual is brought into relation to the macrocosm of the all.”

Joseph Campbell – The Masks of God

 

trees

“The tree is already the image of the world”

Deleuze and Guattari,1000 Plateaus

tree of life

The tree of life, the Tarot, objects and symbols of power all find there way into common cultural currency, witness the masonic motif on the US dollar bill.

Religion and mythology are filled with old stories which can help articulate new visions.

Mythology, Archetypes and Religion are constantly mined by con­temporary culture to encode, shed light on, and add authority to, new thoughts, new ways of thinking and new technologies.

[William Gibson used voodoo myth and symbolism mapped onto his dream of a networked world.]

Human culture is rich in this kind of symbolism and these kinds of dreams, they help to shape the internet already, everything is a metaphor for something in the real or mythological world, from daemons to trash cans.

Expect a new golden dawn.

‘the symbol cluster of the Quest’

how religions work

“That’s how religions work, a few people relate at first, the core of symbols then blossoms to incorporate new input.” Clay Graham

visualisation should help people interpret information

A modern map is an abstraction, an understood convention.

A visualisation of any given data is only useful if you understand what is being represented and why. Without elaborate explana­tion a vector field is only really useful to someone who is used to vector fields. A three dimensional surface map is useless unless you are used to interpreting data in this form. Stock market ana­lysts still prefer a sequence of bar graphs over three dimensional surface maps.

Visualisation should help people interpret information.

New languages, new conventions for abstraction, new kinds of visualisation integrated into our experience of space will change our conception of it.

the collective consciousness

“What did the backer hope to gain from it ? A leased line to the collective unconscious” Neal Stephenson, The Diamond Age

culture

“every culture lives within its dream” Lewis Mumford

cultures give shape to worlds

Cultures give shape to worlds, through shared symbolism, con­vention and meaning.

Massively extended choice in a media context (Cable TV, video, internet access etc.) mean that the social homogoneity that fol­lowed from collectively experienced limited choice broadcast media is breaking down.

But we still all see the same street signs, the same billboards, the same line down the middle of the road.

The ability of a small community to affect the way its members see and experience the space in which they live will mean an end to a commonly held view of that space.

simulation and politics

“all simulation is political” Ted Nelson

scientific annotation

Science, like religion and mythology is a source of observations, classification and modelling leading to interpretation. But unlike religion and mythology it has use beyond communication through metaphor and shared meaning.

Science and rationality applied to an augmentation system, might literally mean describing, modelling, predicting and interpreting the world as we experience it. The collective body of scientific knowledge at your disposal. Plants and animals might be anno­tated and described, physical systems might be modelled with a view to prediction.

the ability to think rationally is pretty rare

Neal Stephenson wrote a book about a young girl growing up in a future dominated by nano technology called The Diamond Age. In it he described a ‘book’, an intelligent nano-computer that

 

functioned as a tutor to the girl, it could teach it’s young reader all the concepts she needed to grasp, from the very simple to the very advanced, through a series of simulations and games, (e.g. escaping from a locked room in a castle requires working out the basic principles of a binary code).

Push Singh at MIT was working on the assumption that lan­guage is heavily linked to spatial metaphor (ted supports bill, Tina is close to joe etc.) and consequently an artificial intelligence approach to language can be developed within the context of a physically accurate 3d environment, you can learn language in the human sense better if you inhabit a 3d space governed by the laws of physics.

land [implicit boundaries]

implicit boundaries

He described to me how on holiday with his wife and children he arrived at a popular beach early to find it empty. For no particu­lar reason he used a bucket and spade to build a perimeter of sand castles 6 meters apart and 25 meters in diameter around his chosen spot. Through the course of the day, the beach filled up and yet no infringement of this unenforcable token boundary occurred.

Bums used to ride around the US on freight trains. They supple­mented this logistical network with a symbol system that they could use to communicate useful information to one another. A given symbol scrawled in chalk might mean something like ‘safe to sleep here’.

flowlines

“At this moment in the evolution of the Web, and considering our demands for the “face-to-face” and the sensual, we must consider the Web primarily as a support system, capable of carrying information from one Temporary Autonomous Zone to another, of defending the Temporary Autonomous Zone, rendering it ‘invisible’ or giving it teeth, as the situation might demand. But more than that: If the Temporary Autonomous Zone is a nomad camp, then the Web helps provide the epics, songs, genealogies and legends of the tribe; it provides the secret caravan routes and raiding trails which make up the flowlines of tribal economy; it even contains some of the very roads they will follow, some of the very dreams they will experience as signs and portents.”

“The despatialization of post-Industrial society provides some benefits (e.g. computer networking) but can also manifest as a form of oppression (homelessness, gentrification, architectural depersonalization, the erasure of Nature, etc.) The communes of the sixties tried to circumvent these forces but failed. The question of land refuses to go away. How can we separate the concept of space from the mechanisms of control? The territorial gangsters, the Nation/States, have hogged the entire map.”

Hakim Bey

 

land as a central tenet of modern power structures

Control of land and freedom of movement are traditional mea­sures of spatial power. Countries, borders, razor wire, check­points, property and prisons all reflect on how the space is subdivided and owned and how people are contained and controlled.

Borders are defined by historical conflict, political struggles, trea­ties and cartographers. Force of arms protects those borders.

The law (backed by force and political will) protects property rights within those borders and defines the way in which land is divided

The map is effectively closed, all land falls clearly under the jurisdiction and ownership of some state or other. There is no new world and no new frontier on the surface of the earth.

Augmenting and annotating reality will lead to a new conception of space, new ways of looking at land ownership, new kinds of com­munities and states.

Whole continents could be colonised over again without directly challenging the existing power structures, without people even being aware that it is happening.

civitas and urbs

“There is an old and useful distinction between the civic and the urban. Latin, as Fustel de Coulanges observed in his great work on the ancient city, distinguishes between the terms civitas and urbs. Families or tribes who joined together because they shared the same religious beliefs, social organization, form of government and modes of production created civitas – a community that was not necessarily related to any particular place or construction. But when such a unit chose a particular site and founded a city in which to dwell – as Rome was founded on the Seven Hills – an urban settlement resulted. So urban space became the territory of the civic formation, and civic principles determined the spatial configuration of the city. Choice of site, performance of the foundation ritual, and organization of the layout were seen as such fundamentally important acts that they were traditionally ascribed to the community’s gods and mythic heroes.”

temporary autonomous zones

Hakim Bey wrote a paper entitled ‘The Temporary Autonomous Zone’. It focuses on anarchist communities living in the gaps left by the dominant power in their domain. Assassins, pirates and the tongs. Communes, dining clubs and gatherings that serve as the anchor for all kinds of social groups and movements.

pirate networks

Pirate Utopias – The sea rovers and corsairs of the 18th century created an ‘information network’ that spanned the globe: primitive and devoted primarily to grim business, the net nevertheless functioned admirably. Scattered throughout the net were islands, remote hideouts where ships could be watered and provisioned, booty traded for luxuries and necessities. Some of these islands supported ‘intentional communities’, whole mini-societies living consciously outside the law and determined to keep it up, even if only for a short but merry life. [see texts like Daniel Defoe’s history of the pirates]

[No more space, no terra incognita. Computer networks are providing gaps in which anarchist communities can find abstracted spaces that can anchor their efforts to live differently. ]

The second generating force behind the TAZ springs from the historical development I call ‘the closure of the map.’ The last bit of Earth unclaimed by any nation-state was eaten up in 1899. Ours is the first century without terra incognita, without a frontier. Nationality is the highest principle of world governance not one speck of rock in the South Seas can be left open, not one remote valley, not even the Moon and planets. This is the apotheosis of ‘territorial gangsterism.’ Not one square inch of Earth goes unpoliced or untaxed…in theory.

occupy these areas clandestinely

from among the experiments of the inter-War period I’ll concentrate instead on the madcap Republic of Fiume, which is much less well known, and was not meant to endure. Gabriele D’Annunzio, Decadent poet, artist, musician, aesthete, womanizer, pioneer daredevil aeronautist, black magician, genius and cad, emerged from World War I as a hero with a small army at his beck and command: the ‘Arditi’. At a loss for adventure, he decided to capture the city of Fiume from Yugoslavia and give it to Italy. After a necromantic ceremony with his mistress in a cemetery in Venice he set out to conquer Fiume, and succeeded without any trouble to speak of. But Italy turned down his generous offer; the Prime Minister called him a fool. In a huff, D’Annunzio decided to declare independence and see how long he could get away with it. He and one of his anarchist friends wrote the Constitution, which declared music to be the central principle of the State . The Navy (made up of deserters and Milanese anarchist maritime unionists) named themselves the Uscochi , after the long- vanished pirates who once lived on local offshore islands and preyed on Venetian and Ottoman shipping. The modern Uscochi succeeded in some wild coups: several rich Italian merchant vessels suddenly gave the Republic a future: money in the coffers! Artists, bohemians, adventurers, anarchists (D’Annunzio corresponded with Malatesta), fugitives and Stateless refugees, homosexuals, military dandies (the uniform was black with pirate skull-&-crossbones later stolen by the SS), and crank reformers of every stripe (including Buddhists, Theosophists and Vedantists) began to show up at Fiume in droves. The party never stopped. Every morning D’Annunzio read poetry and manifestos from his balcony; every evening a concert, then fireworks. This made up the entire activity of the government. Eighteen months later, when the wine and money had run out and the Italian fleet finally showed up and lobbed a few shells at the Municipal Palace, no one had the energy to resist.

meaning trees

Many Europeans have spoken of the uniformity and featurelessness of the Australian landscape. The aborigines, however, see the landscape in a totally different way. Every feature of the landscape is known and has meaning – they then perceive differences which Europeans cannot see. These differences may be in terms of detail or in terms of a magical or invisible landscape, the symbolic space being even more varied than the perceived physical space. As one, example, every individual feature of Ayer’s Rock is linked to a significant myth and the mythological beings who created it.

Every tree, every stain, hole and fissure has meaning.

Thus what to a European is all empty land may be full of noticeable differences to the aborigine and hence rich and complex.

Europeans may thus completely misunderstand the nature of the landscape because of their point of view.

Messages only become meaningful when received and recognised. Signals and signs become perceptual or conceptual meaning through symbols. Symbols thus change the bilogical and geographical world of signals and signs into a human world of meanings.

[...]

Underlying the visible landscape there seemed to be a symbolic landscape which was more real and of which aborigines had a clear notion.

What, therefore, needs to be considered is the relation of this symbolic world to the physical, the relation between symbolic and physical space.

[...]

By using natural features, the physical structure of landscape becomes congruent with mythical structure and hence humanised. If architecture is the mode of creating virtual space, making visible an ethnic domain and setting up a sphere of influence, then aborigines create place by giving meaning to sites in terms of their culture their ethnic domain. They do what architecture does in all the ways described but without the architecture.

To Europeans land meant buildings, crops, man-made artefacts, for aborigines it was a spiritual and emotional thing. Because aborigines did not cultivate land or erect permanent dwellings, that is because they took possession of land in non-material ways rather than in European terms, the latter did not realise that aborigines owned, occupied and used land. They could thus appropriate such land without qualms.

[...]

It thus seems clear that the Australian aborigines were most definitely able to establish a sense of place which was independent of any buildings which they might have constructed. This suggests that in the larger sense the establishment of place is a symbolic process. The use of physical barriers is only one way of achieving this – although, apparently, an essential one in our culture and context.

the survey of india

There are insane maps of india covered in a dense mass of triangles.

George Everest

During the 19th century George Everest initiated a plan to formally survey, and then map, the whole of India.

mapping as conquest and control

Triangulation towers and theodlites became features of Brit­ish India as far as the edges of the empire. Local communities came to see these towers as symbols of final subjugation and resisted violently, attacking and destroying them as they began to encroach on their territory.

maps [borders and boundaries]

Modern mapping provides a context for modern demarcation. The artificial idea of non-porous frontiers and nation states.

Arbitrary lines on maps.

Mapping is a mode of knowing and a method of controlling. [see texts like Ian Barrow’s ‘Moving Frontiers’]

In a scientific context, observation, classification and modelling can be seen as a precursor to engineering, which equates to control.

The military has always been actively involved in map making, the Ordinance Survey in the UK is the primary source of civilian map­ping data and is the primary governmental mapping organisation, until recently it was directly controlled and funded by the military.

During the gulf war, and in former Yugoslavia, the commanders integrated a whole range of spatial mapping technologies, from 3d terrain models to GPS, to enhance their formidable command and control systems.

uncharted territory

Uncharted land and water was always marked on a map as terra incognita.

Ancient and medieval writers mapped through narrative; unveil­ing and revealing the places they had been in associative rather than spatial terms, focusing on descriptions of places, people, and customs. They had more in common with the linear journeys of the songlines than spatial conception of Ptolemaic maps.

colonial cartography

“The first colonial cartographers of India were thus still surveying under the influence of medieval conceptions of the uncharted and its rhetorical practices of revelation. However, the maps drawn by James Rennell and his companion surveyors did introduce new attitudes towards the representation of land and frontiers, attitudes which, in the words of R.H. Phillimore, the Survey’s historian, rescued the map “from the vagaries of fancy.” David Harvey has remarked that the reintroduction of the Ptolemaic grid, with location determined by means of latitude and longitude, stripped maps of all their medieval “elements of fantasy and religious belief, as well as of any signs of the experiences involved in their production.” Maps, now imbued with the principles of Enlightenment rationality, had become, according to Harvey, “abstract and strictly functional systems for the factual ordering of phenomena in space.” While this essay will suggest that medieval spatial notions and cartographic practices together with contingency and contestation fashioned early colonial maps which were neither purely abstract nor functional, Harvey is correct to posit that maps displayed a greater ‘objectivity’. Maps, as he says, lost much of their medieval sensuous, tactile character, and instead emphasized spatial organization and rationality. Nevertheless, how could maps rationally represent, in a coherent and systematic manner, anomalous revenue arrangements whereby, for example, the Company was permitted to demand revenue from certain tracts of land close to Bhutan from July to November only, at which time Bhutan once more claimed jurisdiction.” Ian Barrow, ‘Moving Frontiers’

new geography, new internet

The internet is about to overlay real space

For a while it seemed to stay the other side of the screen. No external evidence of its existence.

It has already escaped into the world. Like a bizarre genetic experiment that got free from a lab, evolving and self replicating uncontrollably.

The web addresses printed on everything.

Sometimes adverts have just an image and a web address, feeling almost like declarations of post-geographical independent statehood.

The next stage in its evolution looks likely to be augmentation.

Notes left on the internet attached to people and things and places that a new generation of devices will make available to you as you walk through the space and encounter those people, things and places.

Like a piece of acetate covered in rough notes and diagrams over­laying and annotating the original plan.

a cultural geography

Geographies of resistance are constituted by the transgression of ideological boundaries that are rooted in particular places and spaces

[...]

Places are active forces in the reproduction of norms, in the definition of appropriate practice

[...]

Power is the ability to make rules for others. The ability to define what constitutes appropriate behavior in a particular place is one fundamental form of this power

[...]

Transgressions disrupt the patterns and processes of normality and offend the subtle myths of consensus.

Tim Cresswell

plasticity of externalised meaning

location aware devices will reduce the importance of physically expressed symbolism bound to the built environment.

The discussion of this new plasticity of externalised meaning can be tied to ideas generated by the cultural analysis of architecture and geography (in a number of ways).

On the one hand, a study of an individual or collectively held internal model of a space can be used to inform the construction of externalised models and interfaces to spaces, on the other such analysis highlights the fact that to a large extent meaning is imposed invisibly already.

out of place

Even if new ways of invisibly annotating, marking and annotating spaces make new uses of space possible, using spaces in new ways is socially controversial.

It is possible to dispute the ‘invisibility’ of reality augmentation.

If invisible marking of spaces results in a change in who is using a space and (or) behaviour changes linked to the users of that space, then the marking of the space is indirectly visible.

If either the behaviour of the users of a space (or the users of the space themselves) appear out of place to whoever controls the space, there will be a perceived spatial and behavioural trans­gression.

Incongruous behaviour or perceived tresspass by one group encroaching on the space of another is a potential source of conflict.

New kinds of transgressions inspired by a new generation of devices may lead to confrontation and conflict.

Even without visible alteration (e.g. graffiti) when collectively held ideas about a space are challenged, either by any kind of per­ceived usage change, or by a change in who is using the space, the controllers of a space are likely to feel threatened. Control in some sense means control over meaning and range of behaviours as well as ownership or the right to exclude.

marigold

public space is used both to assert social norms and contest them.

The question is:

Who is the public space for? Who does the public space exclude? And how are these prohibitions maintained in practice?

Different people are designated different spaces by the people with the power to define boundaries.

Those who transgress the boundaries are made, by the people who control the space, into criminals.

People who are invisible or ignored by government often transgress their allocated boundaries, usually into public spaces, in order to be seen.

Here they become visible because they are not seen to be part of the ‘public’, their presence in public spaces is then contested.

Their transgressive movement is, in effect, seen as a criminal act.

The reason for criminalising their displacement is perhaps to diffuse or warn against other attempts to contest the hegemony.

The transgressive groups have moved onto a background that makes them stand out i.e., ‘public’ space, so that their dissatisfaction with the hegemony can be seen clearly.

They are then excluded publicly from the ‘public’ because they do

 

not behave according to the normative boundaries imposed by the government.

from Marigold

cultural geography focused on resistance.

An analysis of a social space can take the form..

Who uses the space?

Who is excluded?

How are those prohibitions enforced?

What constitutes the meaning and range of ‘acceptable’ behaviour in a given space, as well as who is allowed to use a given space, are made more visible through transgressions.

Mobile phones have led to ordinary people openly talking to them­selves in public spaces, this once suspect behaviour has been assimilated because of wide adoption and social acceptance of the ‘legitimate’ context of cell phone ownership.

It is an uncomfortable feeling if someone is reading from a retinal display while talking to you.

The inhabitants of Middletown still haven’t entirely got used to their mostly naked hippy neighbours.

Why, given there relatively low cost and super-technical capabili­ties, is it unacceptable for homeless people to put up tents in urban spaces?

fear geography

Public blame of victims who were in public places, for being in a dangerous or inappropriate place when they were attacked, encourages all women to transfer their threat appraisal from men to certain public spaces where they may encounter attackers. The other side of this fear of being in public space is for women to adopt false assumptions about their security when in places deemed safe for women, such as the home.

[...]

understanding of women’s use of space necessitates an awareness of their geography of fear

[...]

Women develop individual mental maps of places where they fear assault as a product of their past experience of space and secondary information.

[...]

Informal social control in public areas relies on the potential intervention of others present to act as a deterrant.

[Valentine notes that this has been eroded by automation and spending cuts, which has led to a trend away from the informal moderation of spaces by people capable of intervention]

travellers and the rural idyll

“new age travellers, ravers and drugs racketeers arrived at a strength of two motorized army divisions, complete with several massed bands and, above all, a highly sophisticated command and signals system.” [Conservative MP Michael Spicer speaking in the House of Commons] (Hansard, 1992a: 688)

“I don’t think it should be a crime to want to live like that, to want to live in a rural area rather than a big city. And it’s impossible to go out and rent a cottage or a farmhouse or buy one. Apart from people who are born to it, rural Britain is for the rich. It’s for people who can afford to buy themselves a weekend place or go and retire in the country. For me, if I want to live with space around me and trees and hills and woods, the only possible way apart from sleeping out is to buy a vehicle and live in that.” (Shannon, traveller, quoted in Lowe and Shaw, 1993:240)

[I]f the Government’s proposals are enacted, the only people free to [adopt a nomadic existence] within the criminal law will be those wealthy enough to establish sites around the Country between which they may wander, as medieval monarchs were able to do. (Lord Irvine of Lairg, CJBC-L: 1194)

“The countryside is often considered to be a place where it is possible to put into practice another way of life.” KH

“History has always dismissed the nomads” (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987: 394)

The nomad has a territory; – he [sic] follows customary paths; he goes from one point to another; he is not ignorant of points (water points, dwelling points, assembly points, etc.). But the question is what in nomad life is a principle and what is only a consequence. To begin with, although the points determine paths, they are strictly subordinated to the paths they determine, the reverse of what happens with the sedentary. The water point is reached only to be left behind; every point is a relay and exists only as a relay. A path is always between two points, but the in-between has taken on all the consistency and enjoys both an autonomy and a direction of its own … sedentary space is striated, by walls, enclosures, and roads between enclosures, while nomad space is smooth, marked only by “traits” that are effaced and displaced by the trajectory” (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987: 380-81)

from Kieth Halfacree ‘Travellers and the rural idyll’

patterns of spatial resistance

Cultural geographers have found patterns of spatial resistance that are common to graffiti, New age travellers, the homeless, raves, environmental and political protests and festivals.

Spaces are subject to group appropriation and control, and the act of using a space differently is often viewed as antagonistic. 20th century capitalism is founded on the ownership of property and the right to control the meaning and users of that property to the exclusion of others. It has been aided by the capacity to physically control the organisation and marking of real spaces. When the built environment and the meaning attached to a space become more plastic, and altering that meaning no longer implies directly marking or altering the space, how does that challenge the idea of

who owns (and who can own) the space and what it is for?

Mobile lifestyles consistently find themselves aided and encour­aged by technological developments but in conflict with people trying to control spaces.

tramps

“The mobility of the tramp was resisted on a number of fronts ranging from the courtroom, to the academy to the popular press. Reactions to the tramp formed a classic moral panic in the years 1870 through to the second world war in the United States. Following the development of the first trans-continental railroad in 1869, migrant workers and those without work were suddenly able to travel the length and breadth of the continent in relatively short periods of time. The newspapers were full of advice on how to deal with the new tramp evil ranging from avoidance to poisoning to work camps. The tramp was represented as surely, lazy, politically radical and probably foreign.” Encoding the mobile body: the production of the tramp, Tim Cresswell

just going [one american dream against another]

“The zigzagging of the plot is matched by the zigzagging of the language. It is important to note at this point that On the road was originally written as a 120 foot long continuous unpunctuated paragraph on a role of teletype. Kerouac reportedly wrote it in six days. It was only at the insistence of the editor that Kerouac introduced standard grammar and chapters so that the book could be published (nine years after it was written). Kerouac was attempting to create a nonstop statement of an experience that kept moving, using language with enough energy to break through the limitations of conventional notions of sentence form. Even in the edited version we can see this energy.” Mobility as resistance: geographical reading of Kerouac’s ‘On the road’ Tim Cresswell

Tim Cresswell argues that Jack Kerouac used mobility to express resistance

“Zelinsky (1973) described mobility as one of the defining characteristics of ‘American’ character and how this characteristic was reflected in a landscape of highways and strip developments. My point is that mobility cannot be so simply ‘mapped’ on to the landscape. Mobility is also a deeply threatening and transgressive form of behaviour often described as ‘deviant’ (think of the threat in the term ‘drifter’). The meaning of mobility in the United States (and in On the road) is therefore ambiguous at best.” Mobility as resistance: geographical reading of Kerouac’s ‘On the road’ Tim Cresswell

In on the road Kerouac sets one american dream against another.

Kerouac sets up an opposite to rootedness, familly values and the 1950’s hegemonic version of the american dream.

Kerouac subverts and contests and conjures up a vision allied to another aspect of the american dream ‘the mobile male outlaws’ [cowboys, indians, pioneers, hobos etc].

Dominant ideology in the United States places great emphasis on possession, including the possession of place. It is hard for us to question the value of ideas such as roots, community, home and neighbourhood.

When mobility is emphasized, on the other hand, it is as a means to get somewhere. Both social and spatial mobility are encouraged and connected as long as they result in ‘improvement’. Mobility which is apparently purposeless and seems to result in poverty rather than ‘social climbing’ is not generally encouraged. This is reflected in geography. Migration studies purport to be about movement but use the push and pull factors of points A and B as explanations.

People leave point A because point B appears to be favourable. It is never the case that both point A and B are unbearable and that the motion in between is the ‘pull’ factor.

Negative views of mobility are expressed in the law. Vagrancy laws inspired Kerouac to write ironically:

‘in America camping is considered a healthy sport for Boy Scouts but a crime for mature men who make it their vocation. Poverty is considered a virtue among the monks of civilized nations in America you spend a night in the caboose if you’re caught short without your vagrancy change.’ (Kerouac, 1960, p. 174);

[...]

Mobility represents a search for an American essence; haunted by the spirit of the outlaw, the hobo and the pioneer rather than the settlers, the farmers and the townspeople.”

formula for a new city

The situationists’ programme was based on what they called ‘the construction of situations’. In the first place this meant the bringing together and fusion of various separated art forms in the creation of a single, unified environment. Nor was this process restricted to a new focusing of contemporary artistic activity. All the great artistic Visions and masterpieces of the past should be pillaged and their contents made real: ‘subverted’, as the situationists called it, as part of a real script. All scientific knowledge and technical skill could be brought into play in the same way. For the first time, art and technology could become one: put on the same practical footing With reality. Working out the widest possible unified field of such ‘situations’ would reveal the true dynamic and shape of the city. Most utopian visionaries since Fourier paled before the situationists: ‘Everyone will live in their own cathedral. There will be rooms awakening more vivid fantasies than any drug. There will be houses where it will be impossible not to fall in love. Other houses will prove irresistibly attractive to the benighted traveller…’

(from ‘Formula for a new city’).

The point was the conjuring up and the mastery of immediate subjective experience. ‘Art need no longer be an account of past sensations. It can become the direct organisation of more highly-evolved sensations. It is a question of producing ourselves, not things that enslave us’ (from an article by Guy Debord in the same issue). Thus, the situationist project, as originally outlined, was the liberation of desire in the building of a new world – a world with

which we will be permanently in love.

This put them in much the same position as the first surrealists – and beyond Surrealism in the same position as a liberated psychoanalysis. Or, more simply, in exactly the same position as children. For their underlying philosophy was one of experiment and play – but play equipped with the whole of twentieth-century technology. Ultimately, all that was involved was the simplest thing in the world: wanting to make your dreams come true. And its enemies were equally simple: sterile, subjective fantasy on the one hand and, on the other, its objective counterpart: the world of art.

to play with time and space

Need for total creation has always been inseperable from the need to play with architecture: to play with time and space.

drifting and psychogeography

Before this, however, he was to play a leading role in developing the two main practical techniques used by the lettrists at this time: drifting and psychogeography. The first could be described as a sort of free association in terms of city space. The idea was simply to follow the streets, go down the alleys, through the doors, over the walls, up the trees and into the sunlight, etc, that one found most attractive; to wander, alone or with one’s friends, following no plan but the solicitation of the architecture one encountered. Drifting was an attempt to orient oneself in the absence of any practical considerations: to find the types of architecture one desired unconsciously. Amongst other adventures, they found down by the Seine a door leading to what was supposed to be a small tool store, but was in fact a concealed entrance to those parts of the Paris catacombs that are closed to the public; apparently a large proportion of the total area. Hopefully, many happy hours were spent with the matches, the skulls and the rats.

‘Psychogeography’ was the study and correlation of the material obtained from drifting. It was used on the one hand to try and work out new emotional maps of existing areas and, on the other, to draw up plans for bodies of ‘situations’ to be interlocked in the new utopian cities themselves. During the same period they were also toying with new forms of communication and deconditioning within the city. L’Internationale Lettriste were the first artists to understand the enormous potential of graffiti as a means of literary expression today. A number of the slogans they chalked or painted up – ‘Never work’, ‘Free the passions’, ‘Let us live’ – were to turn up again, more than twenty years later, on the walls of the Latin Quarter in May 1968. They also painted slogans down their trouser-legs and across their ties and shoes. The two latter items they tried to sell.

..photographs of girls, soldiers, bombings, comic-strip frames, maps of cities and diagrams of labyrinths, cathedrals and gardens

Their dominant intellectual concern was still With the fusion of all art forms in a new utopian town planning, while their experiments with architecture and the use of cities continued to provide a practical means of self-expression, a real group cohesion on the level of everyday life. Large-scale dnfts, sometimes using several teams linked by walkie-talkies, were undertaken; psychogeographic studies and architectural plans were worked out in detail. ‘We are only at the beginning of urban civilisation… Twentieth century architects should be building adventures… (IS no. 3, 1959).’

What the Sl in Paris was trying to work out was a new revolutionary critique of society: to discover forms of organisation and activity more effective than the slapstick anarchy of the lettrists. Henri Lefebvre had been their first mentor in social revolution. Once a leading French Communist Party theoretician, Lefebvre had resigned from the Party and become increasingly anarchistic. His basic contention was that contemporary society wasn’t suffering from any shortage of consumer goods, but from a new poverty, a poverty of everyday life, and that revolution today must be focused on the regeneration of this area.

Used from the very first as a term to designate contemporary (French) culture, ‘spectacle’ was a spectacle, a circus, a show, an exhibition, a one-way transmission of experience. It was a form of ‘communication’ to which one side, the audience, can never reply; a culture based on the reduction of almost everyone to a state of abject non-creativity, of receptivity, passivity and isolation. Now they saw that the same structure applied not only to cultural and leisure ‘activity’, not only to political organisation (whether that of the ruling classes or that of the so-called ‘left’). This experience of passivity, isolation and abstraction was the universal experience imposed by contemporary capitalism: an experience radiating from its basic alienation, the commodity. Henceforward, consumer capitalism was to be simply the ‘society of the spectacle’.

The first thing this meant was that the situationists could no longer see themselves as an art movement of any sort at all. Art was no more than the consumer good par excellence. Any work of art, however radical, could be digested by modern capitalism and turned into the opposite of all it had meant to those who originally created it. From the point of view of Paris – increasingly that of Debord, whose intransigence was reinforced by the appearance of Raoul Vaneigem (born 1934) – all the other sections were dabbling far too much in ‘experimental art’ and courting the danger of being separated from what was essentially a total programme. Modern society wouldn’t find any difficulty in reabsorbing individual works of art as the latest, chic revolutionary consumer item; and thus the rejection of consumer society made by the whole group would be compromised.

the new technologies of conditioning

A number of individuals were isolated in an environment designed so that nothing could happen (cells with bare walls, neon lights, the only furniture a comfortable couch and without any sounds, smells or variations in temperature). Extensive disturbances in behaviour resulted. The brain, in the complete absence of all sensory stimulation, falls below the Pitch of excitation necessary if it is to function normally. The Research Service concluded that a boring environment has destructive effects on human behaviour.

the construction of situations

The construction of situations can only begin to be effective as the concept of the spectacle begins to disintegrate. Clearly, the basic principle of the spectacle – nonintervention – is at the heart of all our alienated social life. And, equally clearly, all the most vital features of revolutionary experiment with culture have stemmed from an attempt to break the psychological identification of the spectator with the hero: to sting the spectator into action… Thus the situation is made to be lived by those who made it. The role played by a passive or merely bit-part playing ‘public’ must steadily diminish while that played by people who cannot be called actors, but rather, to coin a new word, ‘livers’, must equally steadily augment.

formula for a new city

As a result, all contemporary art has been forced to become abstract contemporary architecture being the worst example of all. Pure plastic art, telling no story and making no movement, cold and soothing to the eye.

[...]

We want to create environments that are permanently evolving

[...]

The dark has been driven away by electricity and the seasons by central heating. Night and the summer have lost all their charm and the dawn has gone. Those who live in cities want to withdraw from cosmic reality and all they dream of is ways of doing so. For obvious reasons: dreams begin and end in reality.

Yet, contemporary technology could allow an unbroken contact between the individual and cosmic reality – minus some of whatever one considers its asperities. The stars and the rain can be seen through glass ceilings. The mobile house moves with the sun. Sliding walls allow vegetation to invade life. The house on metal tracks can go down to the sea in the morning and come back to the woods at night.

Architecture is the simplest way of articulating time and space; of modulating reality; of making people dream. 1 don’t just mean expressing an ephemeral plastic beauty. Rather, a lasting influence, inscribed in the eternal graph of human desires and progress in realising them.

Thus, future architecture will be a means of modifying contemporary conceptions of time and space. It will be a means of knowledge and a means of action.

The architectural complex will be modifiable, either wholly or in part, by those living there.

Past societies offer an a priori truth and Ethics to the masses. The appearance of the concept of ‘relativity’ in a modern mind allows one to foresee something of an ‘experimental’ nature of the coming civilisation. Experimental isn’t quite the right word. Say, more supple; more ‘amused’. On the basis of this moving civilisation, architecture, at least initially, will be a tool for experimenting with the thousand different ways of modifying life – modifying it to the ends of a synthesis which will be more glorious a kingdom than anything the world has ever known.

A new form of mental illness has swept the planet: banalisation. Everyone is hypnotised by work and by comfort: by the garbage disposal unit, by the lift, by the bathroom, by the washing machine.

This state of affairs, born of a rebellion against the harshness of nature, has far overshot its goal – the liberation of man from material cares – and become a life-destructive obsession. Young people everywhere have been allowed to choose between love and a garbage disposal unit. Everywhere they have chosen the garbage disposal unit. A totally different spiritual attitude has become essential – and it can only be brought into being by making our unconscious desires conscious and by creating entirely new ones. And by a massive propaganda campaign to publicise these desires.

We have already pointed out that desire to construct situations will be one of the main foundations of any new civilisation. This need for total creation has always been inseparable from the need to play with architecture: to play with time and space.

[...]

This new vision of time and space, which will be the theoretical basis of future constructions, is still imprecise and will remain so until there has been real, practical experimentation with possible patterns of behaviour in towns designed solely to this end: towns which, apart from the few buildings strictly necessary for some degree comfort and security, would consist solely buildings highly charged with emotionally evocative power, buildings one can feel, symbolical buildings representing desires, powers, events from the past, the present and the future. A rational extension of traditional religious experience, of myths, of fairy-tales and, above all, of psychoanalysis, ‘into architectural expression’ becomes more more urgent every day… as every reason for falling in love disappears.

Everyone will live in their own cathedral. There will be rooms awakening more vivid fantasies than any drug. There will be houses where it will be impossible not to fall in love. Other houses will prove irresistibly attractive to the benighted traveller…

de sade

De Sade analyses two possible attitudes.

On the one hand, the libertines of the 120 Days of Sodom who can only really enjoy themselves by torturing to death the object they have seduced (and what more fitting homage to a thing than to make it suffer?); or, on the other, the libertines of the ‘Philosophy in the Boudoir’, warm and playful, who do all they can to increase one another’s Pleasure. The former are the feudal-type lords, Vibrant with hatred and revolt; the latter, the masters without slaves, discovering in one another only the reflection of their own pleasure.

Today, seduction tends to become increasingly sadistic. Sadism is inability to forgive the desired person for being an object. Truly seductive people, on the contrary, contain the fullness of desire in themselves; they refuse to play a part and owe their seductiveness to this refusal. In de Sade this would be Dolmance, Eugenie or Madame de Saint-Ange. This plenitude can only exist for the desired person if they can recognise their own will to live in the person who desires them. Real seduction seduces only by its honesty. And not everyone is worth seducing. This is what the ‘Beguines’ of Schweidnitz and their companions (thirteenth century) meant by saying that resistance to sexual advances was the sign of a crass spirit. The Brethren of the Free Spirit expressed the same idea: ‘Anyone who knows the God inhabiting him carries his own Heaven in himself. By the same token, ignorance of one’s own divinity really is a mortal sin. This is the meaning of the Hell which one carries with oneself in earthly life.’

Hell is the emptiness left by separation, the anguish of lovers lying side by side without being together. Non-communication is always like the collapse of a revolutionary movement. The will to death is installed where the will to life has disappeared.

mapping sex

spatial and social weirdness

Sexual relations are one way social relations actually do become concretized. Moreover, we tend to keep sex as contained as possible, and invent all kinds of boundaries to ‘hold it in’ such as monogamy, various legal injunctions, and the so-called common sense notion that sex is something we should keep to ourselves. Like a nation, sexuality has rituals and borders — it even has exiles of various types. Since the idea of a ‘nation’ is one way we perform cognitive mapping, or a way we know who is ‘with’ us and ‘against’ us, it would seem logical that sexuality is another form of cognitive mapping. And indeed, we often use the sex act as a way of mapping ourselves in social space. Why else do we burn to know who is sleeping with whom at work, or among our friends? If you are engaged in conversation with a group of people you don’t know very well, suddenly the social territory seems more familiar when you find out which people are having sex with each other. Or, on a different note, when you begin having sex with someone, your social landscape shifts dramatically. Their friends become your friends, and their social life is open to you because you have a definite place in it as ‘the sex partner.’ I have noticed, in the initial stages of a sexual relationship, the way my partner’s friends and acquaintances will say to me, ‘I’m sure I’ll see you again.’ When I am introduced to friends of friends, I rarely hear such a comment, even if it is likely to be true.

[...]

Sex is also a form of intimacy which is — at least in its most common manifestations — purely physical. This is what makes sex so literal — and so frightening. What if you love somebody, but you do not have ‘good’ sex? Or, more frequently, what if you dislike somebody, but they know exactly what it takes to give you orgasms?

[...]

If sex is so wonderful and pleasurable, why don’t we do it openly, and share it with everyone? The answer is connected directly to the way we tend to understand sex as an object, rather than an action based on thought and emotion. We use sex to quantify the value of particular relationships between people. Sex is a form of private property, which allows us to ‘own’ people or at least to figure out how much we own of them.

[...]

Through sex, I’m measuring something intangible: my connection to a particular person. For this reason, non-monogamy and public or group sex are fundamentally incompatible with the way we map sexuality today. Having been taught that ‘ownership’ and ‘property’ are concepts which limit access to particular objects, we regard sex as something which cannot circulate freely among people.

[...]

how can more than one person possess a single object at once?

Why Do You Want to Get Laid? Mapping Sexual Geographies

 

Annalee Newitz Bad Subjects, Issue # 17, November 1994

sexual geographies

The concern with regulative space and with the spaces of regulation develops Michel Foucault’s project of discipline and sexuality – a field which was, arguably, his least overtly spatial. A recurrent theme running across a number of the articles is the ways in which sexuality in the city figures as a major site of cultural disturbance. Official geographies of immorality and obscenity have repeatedly been a focus for the attempted imposition of strategic order.

[...]

Frank Mort uncovers a more recent version of this double consciousness in the sexual geography of the Wolfenden report in the 1950s. The maps of London circulated by the doyens of Sir John Wolfenden’s inquiry into homosexuality and prostitution provided the most detailed close-ups of the capital’s sexual ‘low life’. Despite the best efforts of Whitehall mandarins to define these immoral worlds as apocryphal and irregular, men from the metropolitan Élite continued to be personally and sexually dependent upon marginal spaces such as these. In all three cases, what is apparent is that the social geography of marginality frequently demonstrates a symbolic centrality. Transgression makes the norm meaningful.

[...]

What we might term a Foucaudian topography of the metropolis has been pivotal in all historical forms of strategic mapping. It would be instantly recognisable to the police commissioner, the magistrate or the sanitary engineer. Operating from on high, it mobilises a panoptic vision of the city and its subjects, who are viewed as part of a landscape and an aesthetics of discipline.

[...]

London’s own characteristic ad hocery, for example, has generated its own recognisable sexual geography. The capital never experienced a police des moeurs, or moral police, on the Parisian model, nor have its zones of respectable and disreputable behaviour been as strategically zoned as in some other European or American cities.

[...]

Moreover, the capital’s importance as the centre of empire, and latterly of post-colonial migration, has thrown up a series of extraordinarily complex spaces and cultures of sexual otherness, which have hybridised the city’s existing populations time and again.

[...]

Insights of this kind problematise static topographies of the city. They also call into question a number of the taken-for-granted spatial divisions of urban society: between the public and the private, between masculine and feminine settings, between high and low cultures. What is apparent from all of these studies is not only the shifting and historically contingent nature of such geographical distinctions, but also the liminal spaces which have been produced at the interstices of divisions of this kind and the social actors who have generated more plural forms of spatiality.

just watching her take off her shoes

g spot

Some female medical educators and researchers who have written about the clitoris and urethral sponge have been inspired to propose new ways of envisioning the female genitals. Instead of subscribing to the generally accepted model in which the clitoris and its shaft are described as a miniature penis, and the urethra, vagina and perineum are all viewed as separate unrelated bodies, they suggest instead that all these structures cohere as one functional unit that is homologous to the penis.

In her book ‘Eve’s Secrets’, Josephine Lowndes Sevely proposes a model of female sexual response in which the clitoris, vagina an urethra are recognised as coordinated entity similar to the penis. Just as the entire penis ø consisting of the two ‘corpus cavernosa’ , the corpus spongiosum (the spongy tissue making up the glans and surrounding the urethra) and the urethra – is a unified structure, so are the female genitals. The structures that comprise the female genitals respond to sexual stimulation in concert.”

SUN MEDICINE / MOON MEDICINE

On the Poison Path we speak of sun medicine and moon medicine. And likewise then, there are sun doctors and moon doctors. For the Great Work neither can be neglected.

The sun doctor moves easily through the world, unperturbed, seemingly able to open doors anywhere she wishes. A life filled with routines and good health, with attendance to detail and reliability, the sun doctor knows where she stands.

The moon doctor has no need for ground. Realities scatter before him like tarot cards in the wind. He flies to the stars and has his way with the Queen of Heaven in her celestial palace. The moon doctor rides dragons and knows the way through hell. The sun doctor knows how to stay out of hell, and does. To the sun doctor every day is unique, every day happens for the first time. To the moon doctor there are no days. He lives in one instant only, eternally preparing the lunar medicine.

angels

On the Seduction of Angels

Our Way is the seduction of angels. Trouble is, sometimes after you’ve seduced the angel, you find that it is really the angel that has seduced you. Then you find out that the angel has horns. Wonderful hard nubs of goatlike horn beneath her hair.

If you are a shaman of our way you don’t care. In fact you are delighted. You love the horns. You kiss and fondle them. You weave intimate designs upon them. And are given woven charms in return.

Angels are hard to pin down. Ethereal. Their nature is movement. They are vectors, messengers.

Angels are betweens, and the between is of special interest to Hermeticists. One doctor of our way was visited at night by an angel who made love to her and then instructed her in the secrets of the preparation of the Great Stone. Rene Descartes was given the keys to mathematics.

Angels incarnate into plants and springs, into trees, into certain trails and grottos. When, they enter men or women we detect it by a subtle glow.

Walking into sleep secretly awake, into dreams without succumbing. Our way involves the will.

When the angel comes to your bed you might say no.

if you are sick, or poisoned, the angel can threaten you, might say, “Make love with me or I will kill you, I will make you sick. I will make you crazy. I will steal your soul and hide it where neither you nor the psychiatrists will ever find it.” In such a circumstance it is best not to play the martyr.

Rituals invoke angels, especially sexual rituals. Threesomes, the minimal orgy. Or mere nudity

When she comes she is naked. The way she moves, the way she dances, it is as if she holds a knife, a chopper, and the things you thought were absolutely true and real reel and bleed

every angel is terrible..

Or maybe you have an opium ally. She is more than friendly. She’ll call you up and invite you over. And she is voluptuous, so you go. She is so good to you it seems like heaven. You get what I mean.

Be ready to make deals. Try to get something for yourself

They never give anything for free. None of them do, not the most wholly and thoroughly benevolent, not the sun itself

dvesa, “hatred” or “aversion,” a green snake;

and

moha, “ignorance”, “folly”, “delusion,” represented as a black hog.

They chase each other and bite each other’s tails.

Each poison is dependent on the others, and the whole cycle of birth and death is dependent upon them.

maps

new ways of seeing [science as a sequence of maps]

Conventional maps represent new ways of seeing and interpret­ing the space. Maps linked to, and illustrating, statistical data and migration patterns, physical, political and climatic maps, all have utility in a relevant context, but also affect the way we think about what is mapped.

 

Science can be seen as a more abstract set of maps, opening up new territories for exploration

the whirlwind tour of modern mapping

“…just as those old atlases portrayed a world at once larger and startling and disquietingly different to citizens of the sixteenth century, a new atlas is aborning in the maps churned out by contemporary scientists; just as the world looks back to celebrate and ponder the quincentennial feats of Columbus, science is making and mapping discoveries of entirely new and equally momentous geographies.

[...]

A whirlwind tour of the world captured by modern mapping extends from the atomic and microscopic to the cosmic. Planetary geologists have mapped the hills and dales of Venus by radar, Mars by magnetometer, Jupiter with photopolarimeters, the moon in person. Paleoecologists have mapped the location of lakes that dotted the Sahara until disappearing four thousand years ago, and climate modellers are mapping the climate as it will appear one hundred years hence. From 590 miles up in space, satellites can determine the average income of a neigbourhood, follow wandering ice bergs, track wandering albatross; from instruments resting on the surface of the earth, physicists can see into the heart of the planet, into the heart of the atom, into the big bang. Astronomy’s new telescopes chart the cosmos in all its multiple electromagnetic personalties: optical of course but also xray, gamma ray, infrared, radio, and ultraviolet. Biologists have mapped the location of proteins, electrons in atoms. Neurobiologists have mapped areas of the brain that light up when we dream. Where Aeneas may once have trod, the smouldering phlegrean fields now glow in aerial infrared maps. No earthly or celestial or even artistic territory has been spared this rampant cartography: experts not long ago scanned the Mona Lisa’s sublime and mysterious face with a microdensitometer, measuring and mapping the topography of pigments in la gioconda’s smile.”

The aboriginal concept of space clashed with western ideas of law and land ownership. Colonial settlers parcelled land up into neat rectangles enforcing these arbitrary boundaries with force and punishing trespassers.

A journey, and ritual associated with that journey were at the heart of the aboriginal understanding of their relationship to the land.

human beings as pattern following creatures

The army always seemed to me quite stupid.

It’s traditional key features, uniforms, drill, marching, rank, endless exercises, applied to young men who were not necessarily incred­ibly bright.

As far as I can tell I’m a pattern following animal.

There are whole years of my life that I cannot clearly remember. Sometimes in an effort to recover those years, and in the absence of a journal or diary to remind me, I grab a pile of bank statement from that year and study them to see roughly where I was and what I was doing. Usually mind numbing patterns emerge. Same Safeway, same day, every two weeks, roughly the same amount spent. Same ATM every friday night roughly the same amount. Every two weeks a meal at one of a small number of revisited restaurants. Every month rent cheque, haircut, some aberrant item like clothing or travel. If I continue long enough the pattern breaks up temporarily as I move to another city and then quickly settles down again. If I had my grocery receipts I’d find roughly the same food items recurring for months at a time. If I could trace my movements I’d find myself taking similar routes over and over again to get to the same set of destinations.

All of sudden the army isn’t so stupid. They know I’m a pat­tern-based animal, that I like patterns and find it hard to break them once they are established. So they instill patterns for every conceivable situation that a soldier might face, so that when finally that situation occurs it is easier to follow the pattern than do any­thing else (like run away).

Then there is dependence on patterns like always having some­where to sleep, always having a place to get food from, always having the same people with you, always doing the same tasks.

institutions

Sophistication, change and novelty, can cripple large institu­tions. Just clearly tell people what to do and let it be a subset of what they have always done otherwise nothing will ever actually get done. Institutions need to innovate with care, or with great violence.

A good startup company, begins agile and original, smashing the ingrained patterns of its competitors, when it reaches a certain stage of life it begins to congeal, patterns emerge and it becomes political and institutional. Smashing those patterns is possible but harder than starting again, hence the number, and success of startups in a time of accelerated change.

Venture capitalists, and the startups they fund, are the R&D department of corporate America. They take the risks and when something works it gets assimilated.

patterns in behaviour

For a while I used to keep a diary, diary entries were limited to a maximum of 10 words. An entry on a given day might look like this:

2. 3.96

climb.walk.work

sunlight.Carly.happy

The first five words were reserved for practical things, so if I worked, did nothing, wrote or coded I would use an appropriate word to represent that mental activity, if I did physical stuff like walking and climbing I’d enter whatever the activities were.

The second five words were more abstract. I’d try and think of keywords that would distill my feelings about the day (mood, people and sensations)

11.11.98

climb.swim.work”empty.bored.overcast

At night, before I wrote anything down, I’d lie in bed and try and retrace my steps during the course of the day. Establishing exactly where I had been, any interactions, and what I had done. Almost

 

a meditation ritual for sealing the day. When I had the day clear in my head, I’d distill the day down into a few practical words, and a few words that represented feelings.

[..in western culture this structuring used to fall into the category of prayer, going through your day at the end of it, considering your actions and your motives, but atheists have often discarded this practical tool, throwing babies out with bath water]

This distillation of a day down into a few words can function as a rigid form for a log. A haiku diary that, over time, builds up until patterns emerge.

Because of the concise and constrained form, it was easy to see the patterns. Patterns of productivity and inaction, of happiness, boredom and darkness, people recurring, appearing and disap­pearing, change of location (temporary and permanent).

A normal journal is too long to be read in this way. I always found that when I wrote a full page every day, and returned to it later, all I wanted was just an indication of mood, place, activity and people, and that it was hard to see patterns emerge over a longer time period, given that there was so much to read.

Another concept is the pure mood log, define a list of categories..

Boredom, fitness, health, how horny you feel, confidence, happi­ness, and then each day rate each of the categories on a scale from -5 to +5.

Then you can graph your mood and your ‘state’ over time.

Build a website that allows a group of people to do this. Aggregate moodlog entries within groups and determine group mood, plot the site graph and see if you could map mood to world events or local incidents.

Show people their patterns in a way that might be directly useful and interesting to them, even suggest changes in behaviour and be able to measure and show direct changes in mood resulting.

The extent of their effort would be 10 words or less a day for the diary, 10 numbers entered into the mood log a lot easier than keeping a conventional journal.

human patterns have become commoditised

“It was indeed the age of of information, but information was not the precursor to knowledge, it was the tool of salesmen” Earl Shorris – A Nation of Salesmen

showing people there patterns rather than using them as sales tools

Market researchers have mutated into profilers of individuals.

Market researchers have long been keying their information geo­graphically. One of the big digital mapping data companies GDT is a wholly owned subsidiary of a large market research firm, R.L. Polk (their tagline: ‘multi-dimensional intelligence’).

Zipcodes function as a means of subdividing the US for market research purposes, that is, they are a convenient topological convention for organising personal and property related data, a geographical axis.

Large chunks of the third world have no equivalent system (due to the lack of pressure from market researchers).

People could have their own patterns made available to them for non-commercial use.

extension of digital patterns and logs into physical space

The same mass tracking of behaviour that is evolving on the web, maps onto the behaviour of people and the movement of animals and objects in the real world. At the point when devices that travel with you everywhere are aware of their location, it becomes pos­sible to track you in the real world.

sell your morning walk

If you are native to a city and a tourist asks you for directions to a place, you do not necessarily tell them the way you yourself would go, which might involve convoluted shortcuts and complications, you tell them the shortest clearly describable route.

Map the way people get from A to B, and establish that tourists travel one way, locals travel one way and commercial drivers yet another.

A tourist could access that information to get a different view of the city, finding out which way a local would go, or maybe a spe­cific individual would go.

Mapquest finesse there routefinding capability using information from commercial drivers (making it difficult for a rival service to easily duplicate what they have with a pure static technology solu­tion to routefinding).

You could sell your morning walk

..consider everyone selling their morning walk

Market research used to be labour intensive and data was expen­sive to gather. Now the job is being pushed out on to the internet and we all indirectly gather data, by navigating the internet and filling in forms, and buying stuff.

Beyond studying our habits as we sit in front of computer comes the point at which everything that is static in the world is mapped and everything that moves (vehicles, portable stuff, animals, people) is tagged, location aware and on the network.

Consider the patterns of migration and ebb and flow that might emerge when that data was harvested. The maps and the visuali­sations of that data. Beautiful, useful and terrifying (like any good technology).

The dark implications are similar to there web based counterparts, with an emphasis on spatial monitoring and control.

 

seti and solloway

Elliot Solloway builds educational software while working with underprivileged kids in the school system in Detroit.

His software offers young kids a chance to think like undergradu­ates. Complexities like modeling phenomena using differential equations are present, but hidden, using natural language scaf­folding.

An example would be a piece of software for studying the local stream. You take a picture of your local stream and that image becomes the backdrop for the software, then, as a class, you begin to study it. You take measurements of all kinds. All this data is entered into the software, which becomes, over time, a model of the stream, At some point you begin to notice patterns emerg­ing, you use your model to predict outcomes and suggest causal relationships.

Another example would be modelling weather. This gets interest­ing at the point where you get kids in schools all across the world submitting data in a common form over the web. Everyone begins to contribute to a more or less accurate model of the weather independent of professional meteorologists.

If the meteorologists make some suggestions as to what kinds of phenomena they need studied, an army of kids is now at there disposal generating data and learning as they do so.

Compare this to SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Life) a govern­ment funded project that had it’s budget cut dramatically. They leveraged what they had by building a distributed model for processing the data they were collecting. The team were able to release a screensaver that used spare computing cycles on any internet connected desktop to help with the number crunching.

Intel launched a screen saver that uses spare computing cycles to help cancer research.

Recently, according to Solloway, kids across America tracked the migration of a particular species of butterfly. The implication is that kids (and everyone else) can make big science and data gather­ing projects viable in the absence of huge grants. (see also the educational initiatives of the Digital Earth project).

rooms with histories

“I have a weakness for places – old battlefields, car-crash sites, houses where famous authors lived. Bygone passions should always have an address, it seems to me. Ideally, the world would be covered with plaques and markers listing the notable events that occured at each particular spot. A sign on every pay phone would describe how a woman broke up with her finace here, how a young ballplayer learned that he had made the team. Unfortunately, the world itself is fluid and changes out from under us; the rocky islands Mark Twain was careful to avoid in the Mississippi are now stone outcroppings in a bean field. Meanwhile, our passions proliferate into illegibility, and the places they occur can’t hold them. Eventually pay phones will become relics of an almost vanished landscape, and of a time when there were fewer of us and our stories were on an earlier page. Romantics like me will have to reimagine our passions as they are – unmoored to earth, like an infinitude of cell-phone messages flying through the atmosphere.”

implicit rather than explicit

Aborigines can make the most exact and complex maps of the journeys of their ancestral figures and they themselves re-enact the journey going in procession from sacred spot to sacred spot, following the divine route. If we remember the processions in tracing the boundaries of Roman (and other) cities we find a similar way of defining place except that it was expressed concretely by building walls. In fact aboriginal areas where sacred objects are stored became sanctified and animals and people in them were safe – an early form of the city or house of refuge but without physical construction.

Aborigines do not move just in a landscape but in a humanised realm saturated with signfications.

Aborigines structure their existing physical landscape mentally, mythically and symbolically without building it.

gps data streams [eben moglen and immaterial incorporated]

MOGLEN: Well, I don’t think their answer is there’s nothing we’re going to be able to do about it. But the answer is we are no longer attempting to delay the adoption of strong encryption technology by United States export controls. You’ll notice that last night they took the error out the GPS.

WORTHINGTON: So Iraq is now going to be able to target its cruise missiles precisely on top of the Washington Monument and not 50 meters away.

MOGLEN: Yes. The military says they will continue to provide wrong information in just those places that are absolutely important, but I don’t think that means the White House or the Washington Monument. I think that means missile silos in Montana.

WORTHINGTON: Do you think, ten years from now, we’ll see maps published showing the version of the United States that’s being released now, with these abrupt transitions from crystal clarity to fog?

MOGLEN: Mapmaking is a very interesting subject in general, because when everybody in the country is carrying GPS equipment, one kind of mapmaking that will be absolutely possible consists of the whole structure of what we think of as free data. That is to say – people voluntarily walking around with GPS equipped cell phones donating the stream of their information to a mapping database which will be a very accurate map of everywhere all the time. Every bridge, every road, every place in the country will be repeatedly measured by people moving around with GPS equipment.

WORTHINGTON: Have you heard of any project like this today?

MOGLEN: I’m not aware of any. But you can see that it will happen, because that data stream will exist, and there will be a kind of decentralized geographic information service structure, but I don’t think anybody has yet thought about what will happen. You have lots of people thinking about it from a commercial point of view – Pizza Hut guys wondering how soon they’ll be able to advertise to you on your cell phone where the closest Pizza Hut is.

no guarantee of liberatory use of tech

“The banalization of TV, the yuppification of computers & the militarization of Space suggest that these technologies in themselves provide no “determined” guarantee of their liberatory use.”

Hakim Bey

liberation and destruction

New technology, before it arrives, heralds destruction or libera­tion depending on whose account you happen to be reading. The internet has been (all at once) an anarchists tool, a military tool, a tool for salesmen and businesses, and in general a communica­tions medium for everyone able to use it for whatever purpose they intend.

social control [police sensorium]

“But this is hardly the ultimate police sensorium. As gang hysteria and the war on crack keep the city’s coffers open to police funding requests, it is likely the LAPD will continue to win political support for ambitious capital investment programs in new technology. Having brought policing up to the levels of the Vietnam War and early NASA, it is almost inevitable that the LAPD, and other advanced police force, will try to acquire the technology of the Electronic Battlefield and even Star Wars. We are at the threshold of the universal electronic tagging of property and people – both criminal and non-criminal (small children, for example) – monitered by both cellular and centralized surveillances. Of the latter, ex-Los Angeles police chief, and now state senator, Ed Davis (Republican – Valencia) has proposed the use of a geosynclical space satellite to counter pandemic car theft in the region. Electronic alarm systems, already tested in New England, would alert police if a properly tagged car was stolen; satellite monitoring would extend coverage over Los Angeles’s vast metropolitan area. Once in orbit, of course, the role of a law enforcement satellite would grow to encompass other forms of surveillance and control.” page 253

“As part of it’s “astro” program LAPD helicopters maintain an average nineteen-hour-per-day vigil over ‘high crime areas’, tactically coordinated to patrol car forces, and exceeding even the British Army’s surveillance of Belfast. To facilitate ground-air synchronization, thousands of residential rooftops have been painted with identifying street numbers, transforming the aerial view of the city into a huge police grid.” page 252

“To complain about the society of the spectacle as a contemporary social disease is to forget the it was the Romans who declared that all the people wanted in order to be contented was bread and circuses, or pizza and television, if you prefer.” Marcos Novak

social control through information

People will almost certainly use location aware devices without strong privacy protection in place, as long as transactions are secure and there is no overt discernable violation. If it makes there lives easier Ameri­cans seem content to have huge market research firms keeping data on them and selling that data.

This is an argument for strong encryption, impartial automated infomediaries, and a non-proprietary distributed open source infrastructure.

If this technology impacts without privacy built-in, all kinds of organisations could not only know your internet browsing habits, but where and when you go (in real time – i.e. where are you now), what you buy and who you see, and from that establish the patterns in your spatial behaviour. A step beyond being able to sell your bank statement.

If all our experience becomes mediated by technology how do we stop salesmen getting access to our every waking moment irrespective of place and time?

magic(k)al tech

magic[k]al tech definition

‘magickal technology’ defined as tools that allow individuals and groups to generate, impose and reinforce alternative realities and ways of seeing.

magickal technology manifests in diverse ways; consumer elec­tronics, buildings and the environment, habits of mind and social norms, conventions relating to the body..

..Location aware devices (LADS) represent a significant develop­ment in the evolution of magickal technology.

[read the headmap manifesto and headmap localis(z)ation for more on the implications of location aware devices]

hyp[g]nosis

Milton Erickson, the hypnotherapy guru made it clear that even under hypnosis it’s very difficult to force someone to do something against their will. However it is pos­sible through suggestion to lead them where you want them to go. The power of suggestion means is possible to get people to do things by genrat­ing an imagined environment and context in which the choice you want them to make is implicit. For example it’s much easier to suggest to someone they get naked on a nudist beach than in a library. The trance state that accompanies hypnotherapy allows internal manipulation of context and environ­ment to create an implicit suggestion (rather than having to manipulate the external environment)

..everyday environments suggestively coercive

Mind control then is a less serious problem than having your mind directed. Any environment can be created to imply an action or a thought.

Community and the built environment are both structured in such a way that your choices are infinite but the ones that are favoured by the architects of the community or the environment are easy, unconstrained and manifest.

People usually recognise and choose from (and accept) the obvious choices (Microsoft Word is infinitely configurable to suit the users preference, but the majority of users never change the default settings, the French resistance was a minority faction during the nazi occupation)

This is only sinister if the implied choices and action go against your interests, or the interests of others.

 

empirical limitations and ehancing the senses

The human mind does not perceive, and never has perceived, ‘reality’ to its ultimate extent. Perceptual tests reveal that the human mind derives its impression of so-called ‘reality’ through an astonishingly narrow and data-poor series of quick retinal impressions. This very limited visual tracking – commonly only ten to fifteen percent of our environment is ever subjected to a direct flow by the eyeball – is assembled into a seamless perception of reality by the optic centre of the brain (assisted by neural-net subprocessing in the retina and optic nerve). These human organic, wet-ware visual processors like all processors, could be ‘hacked’.

Beyond judgement – this is in some sense the last revelation. The entire ontological structure of Cartesian doubt has been rendered irrelevant by neural-implant science. The fundamental cosmic constants of life and thought can now be directly engineered. Philosophy’s despotism with its predilection for Platonic-fascist top-down solutions is subverted. With the capacity to enhance the effect, our physical command over the means of perception and cognition are complete. Here wet chemical and dry computer digital engineering converge.

disinformation ‘strange days (virtual spaces) by Adrian Gargett, Ph.D

trance, suggestion, set and setting

Hypnosis then is two things, gnosis (a trance state) and sugges­tion (based in a non-material, pliable context and environment).

Set and setting are words taken from the language surrounding the use of psychedelic drugs, your trip will go, not just well or badly, but in particular directions, largely based on your state of mind (set), your environment and who you are with (setting).

the original captain trips

Whereas many LSD practitioners were content to strap their patients onto a 3’ x 6’ cot and have them attempt to perform a battery of mathematical formulae with a head full of LSD, Hubbard believed in a comfortable couch and throw pillows. He also employed icons and symbols to send the experience into a variety of different directions: someone uptight may be asked to look at a photo of a glacier, which would soon melt into blissful relaxation; a person seeking the spiritual would be directed to a picture of Jesus, and enter into a one-on-one relationship with the Savior.

‘the original captain trips’ by Todd Brendan Fahey

build your way out

Set and setting are the basis of suggestion. Suggestion is just as powerful in ordinary states as it is in trance states.

Even in the absence of a trance state or hallucinogentic drugs, set and setting are all pervasive and powerful in shaping human com­munities and constructs for good and for bad.

For the most part set and setting have remained only partially in the control of individuals, the built environment, especially in cities is something externally determined and subject to incredible inter­tia, buildings tend not to be moved very often and replacements take a long time to build when they are.

The power of set and setting extends beyond choices to implied processes and actions. Kids find themselves at school surrounded by other kids, teachers and text books, and are implicitly bound to the patterns this reality dictates. Schools are usually/often there for the benefit of the kids (this thought is adjustable depending on the school, the teachers and how paranoid you are) but the implicit coercive artifice is real none the less. The same is true of the world of work, military and monastic life, occult sects and revolutionary movements, and these are just the explicit and overtly contrived cases. Arbitrary realities designed to imply ways of doing things (and who you should listen to) that usually do not originate from the individual. Even in the absence of contrivance and design, accidental or de facto structures can still imply a nar­rower range of actions.

Milton Erickson implies that it in terms of suggestion it is arbitrary whether the constructed environment and context for making a suggestion viable and attractive are internally visualised in a trance or externally realised as a real physically apprehensible situation. Physical and mental structures and processes indivis­ible.

[someone pointed out that the best way to get someone to rob a bank was not to hypnotise them but to tell them, in an appropriate setting, that it was part of a carefully controlled psychology experi­ment]

The liberating aspect of all this is that if you have the means to create your own set and setting you can make structures that implicitly support you in your efforts to get wherever you want to go and narrow down (or open up) your range of choices to get you closer to the choices you want to make. The capacity to alter the external environment can be limited in the absence of sufficient money or power. But music, art and graffiti, warehouse parties, raves and music festivals, camcorders, desktop publishing, drugs, fashion, groups and scenes have all served to give people a way to inexpensively and spontaneously ovelay an alternative vision onto contexts and environments (sets and settings) they do not directly control.

It also implies that control over your environment is not something to be surrendered lightly or blindly.

It is a good where possible idea to practice on a small scale constructing your own built environment. Organising warehouse parties, building your own house or temporary shelter are actually ways to take control of your own mind.

During the early seventies the hippies, realising that they were going to have to build themselves free of social conventions, spent a good deal of energy focused on building communes, homes and shelters without recourse to architects or conventional forms [see the book Shelter edited by Lloyd Khan and the Whole Earth Catalog’s]

magickal tenets

A new generation of pragmatic occultists made very clear a view of magick which is usable whether you allow action at a distance or restrict yourself to psychology.

 

They assert that belief in itself can manifest worlds that you cannot access without it.

It is a central tenet of occult systems of magick that belief and belief systems change the shape of reality.

the placebo effect works if the patient believes the drug being taken will be effective.

mathematics and science are magickal technologies that have conjured many different worlds during there evolution

consider the many different geometries that have arisen since Euclid or the quantum and newtonian realities which currently co-exist but which manifest different worlds

Mathematics was always on the occult magickal curriculum

and despite criticism of mathematics engineering and science for over focusing on the material world, the reality is that both activi­ties manifest incredible internal worlds and the real world manifes­tation for a long time remained incidental (archimedes considered engineering and science a distraction from the pure abstraction)

..that is control over the internal world is in some sense control over the external world

the meta belief that belief is a tool

You are the totality of what you do and can therefore change yourself by doing otherwise. Magic is the art of deliberately believing and pretending very hard and finding that it works. Highly improbable things can be done by those who are prepared to experiment with the belief that they are not quite so improbable. The world is an illusion, it has played a confidence trick on you if you let it define who you are. However, you are able to play confidence tricks on the universe and force it to accept your own definition of yourself(s). In fact, the universe, being a humorous, obliging and magical structure, will invariably collude in any such definitions you care to make, if you act skillfully. We are all charlatans, especially those persons pretending to be normal ordinary people….

[...]

..accept the meta-belief that belief is a tool for achieving effects; it is not an end in itself.

Peter Carroll [From ‘Chaoism and Chaos Magic’, Chaos International, issue 10; p. 11.]

magicians dealing in abstractions

Interestingly many modern (occult) magickians have tried to strip away a lot of traditional occult dogma and do not require you to sign up for satan or buddha, they argue that the tarot and the i ching work on the same principal of externalising the psyche, so choose either or make up your own equivalent, they say dedicate your rituals to whoever you want because the process is more important. .

Magicians may not care about which gods they pray to, but they do care about the abstractions, the foundations, and about magickal technology; they want a science of set and setting.

..empiricism

Whether there is a real world is a difficult question, but whether there is or isn’t, the world we experience is an internal construct derived from sense data. Consequently the difference between the real and the imagined is at least at some level arbitrary.

brain valve

To make biological survival possible, Mind at Large has to be funneled through the reducing valve of the brain and nervous system. What comes out at the other end is a measly trickle of the kind of consciousness which will help us to stay alive on the surface of this Particular planet.

[...]

Aldous Huxley, The Doors of Perception

the brain valve and the ego filter

In ‘the doors of perception’ Huxley argued that what we perceive normally is a filtered version of what are perceiving.

Carlos Castenada talks in terms of shifting the parameters of this filter (the assemplage point) to create new subjective realities.

some heuristic assumptions about conciousness:

- what the conscious mind is aware of is a filtered subset of what is actually perceivable and / or perceived

- the parameters of that filter can be changed effectively creating a new world

Huxley argued that hallucinogens were a ‘pipeline to Mind at Large by-passing the brain valve and ego-filter’

further assumptions

- the unconcious mind maintains the rules / map of the world and the conscious mind is subject to those rules and the constraints of the map

- gnosis / trance states allow constructive / manipulative interac­tion with the unconcious mind

- unconscious / conscious split treated as equivalent to world / self split

Acting on the self (conscious mind) then has limited effective­ness compared to changing the world (unconscious mind) which constrains the self

 

magick, soft forms hard forms

Acting on and interacting with the world [unconcious] rather than the self [conscious] is the focus of many esoteric practices (e.g. magick, meditation) but it is also the subject of serious study among psycholgists and medical researchers (e.g. hypnotherapy, placebo)

It is possible to effectively talk about acting on the world / uncon­cious from two divergent points of view

There is a spectrum with action at a distance and the group mind at one end (magick) and psychology/psychotherapy at the other

soft forms – hypnootherapy placebo

hard forms – action at a distance, group mind, aether

esoteric energy [useful model or independent and interdependent link between people]

other planes [states of consciousness or places separate and shared by others]

contriving and internalising intent and belief [changing the self or changing the universe]

ritually extermalising the psyche [working on the self or group mind / aether]

telepathy [information theory or group mind / aether]

the step between soft forms of these ideas and hard forms is small in language terms but fraught in intellectual terms.

that step is bound up with abandoning conventional attempts at material explanations in favour of some unverifiable process that allows action at a distance.

At which point you allow astral travel to be actual rather than symbolic (in the sense of the representational accuracy of what is seen, rather than a material reality). You allow spells to affect the material/aetherial universe rather than being a method for instilling intent into yourself. The individual psyche becomes joined to the collective psyche, such that actions within can cause change with­out, again so that symbolism gives way to a real networked larger or distributed consciousness.

telepathy becomes independent of information theory arguments about line of sight and infinite amounts of information fitting through the slightest connection.

energy and chakras cease to be ways of describing and become systems aligned to higher consciousness that allow occult martial applications as well as higher communication and healing

Tarot cards become not just tools for externalising the psyche, but genuine divination tools

the interesting thing is that the step doesn’t have to be taken to make the ideas useful, but that taking it makes your use of the ideas more intense. Belief may be a tool, it may be expedient to take the step even if it is wrong.

the observer affects the outcome

The observer affects the outcome. Consider trust and faith as things that are affected by the truster as much as the trusted, jeal­ousy can lead to unfaithfulness or at least constrain the actions of the trusted in negative ways.

belief as a tool rather than an end in itself

when you first come across chakras (see below for a description of chakras) often you are told to imagine them and subsequently after a period of time as you work with the imaginary structures you begin to feel them

Companies have a similar quality, a company is brought into being by imagining the structure and then manifesting it.

magick as heuristic

The line between magick and not magick is usually drawn by the observer

much that was magical is not anymore, modern science is science and not magic, chemistry is science and not alchemy

yoga is ordinary and is closer to aerobics in a lot of peoples minds than magic

occult as heuristic

occult as being constantly mined as a heuristic (and as a source of metaphors ..daemons etc)

Acupuncture and the whole concept of energy meridians have had no basis in modern science (research is just beginning to suggest otherwise). Western science has no model that supports these ideas. Yet western doctors have been recommending acupuncture and other ‘unfounded’ alternative therapies.

Mathematicians often arrive at something that is true without being able to describe the logical foundation or the whole chain of reasoning behind that answer, because they don’t know it. Calcu­lus is an example, calculus was used for a hundred years before the logical foundations began to be worked out. It was magic for a hundred years.

The alternative way to look at acupuncture, or calculus in its early stages, or any answer to a mathematical problem that you arrive at, are confident in, but have no clear incontrovertible basis for, is that your solution is heuristic. It as an answer that appears to work, that you find a basis for in parallel to using the answer while it still works.

Heuristics is a classic mathematical problem solving tool. Find the answer any way you can and then find a logical route to that answer. [see Pappus]

magick and the occult stripped of its conventional associations can be considered in heuristic terms

changing infrastructures

esoteric, occult, magick, ecstatic and hallucinogenic practices are often not ends in themselves but coded or explicit ways of altering what you are or might be.

gnosis

gnosis, that is various forms of trance, is central many of these changing infrastructures. Gnosis allows you to working on yourself at a low enough level

art objects

Art is a magickal technology. Both explicitly and implicitly.

art objects are magickal in the literal occult sense of being manifested expressions of will. Picasso produced highly charged objects with focused intent. Fetish objects.

Songs can be seen as sigils/mantras, pure cyclic statements of will and desire.

Art objects are also implicitly magickal in that they can create worlds with different rules and assumptions. Theatre employs elements of gnosis, by convention or realism causing suspension of disbelief, creating worlds with different rules and assumptions. Diggers, grifters, soldiers.

hypnosis

hypnosis is two things, a trance state and suggestion.

trance

trance states open you up, and make you succep­tible to suggestion.

there are many ways of achieveing a trance state, most connected with conventional hypnosis are based on the fol­lowing pattern:

focusing attention, for example on some visible point.

deepening your breathing

shifting attention from external sensation to internal thoughts, spatial visualisation, memories or processes. e.g. focusing on your breath, visualising some real or imagined place, visualising chakras and energy flow.

Hypnotic trances ranges from light to deep somnambulistic states.

deepening the trance state often involves metaphors to do with progression and often descent. e.g counting up or down, descend­ing stairs, visualising each of the chakras in turn, following a path leading somewhere tranquil.

hypnotists, often use challenges to establish a level of authority over their subjects. e.g. your eyelids are getting so heavy you cannot resist closing your eyes, your arms are so getting heavy you cannot lift them (or so light that they rise up on there own)

in inducing a trance state the hypnotist is studying the subject and trying to appear authoritative and to reinforce (and therefore appear responsible for) what follows from a succeptible subjects increasingly altered state.

Milton Erickson described another method of establishing an inti­tial trance. A subject would approach him and he would move as if to shake hands and as the subject reached out to him he would take the subjects outstretched right hand with his left and move it up. The split second of confusion that this caused erickson would use to establish the trance. Stage hypnotists use variations on this idea based on the confusion, disorientation and dislocation stemming from their subjects being in a stressful and potentially embarrassing situation. Shock, disorientate, suggest. Teachers and army officers use similar ideas.

suggestion and suggestibility

Hypnotists argue that it is extremely difficult to persuade a hypno­tised subject to do something that clashes with the subjects core values, and consequently suggestion works by either constructing a real or imagined context in which the required suggestion makes sense to the subject.

Human beings are just as open to suggestion whether in a trance state or not, but a trance state allows a hypnotist to work using the subjects internal constructs rather than having to construct real environments and social situations that reinforce the suggestion.

Hypnotherapists argue that entranced subjects are more conscious of the meaning of archetypes, symbolism and metaphor and that consequently stories can be con­structed that relate to the resolution or explorartion of a subjects life situation. Milton Erckson compiled books of tales appropriate to given situations and conditions.

All the conventional tricks of hypnotists, rigidity, tempo­rary amnesia, triggering post-hypnotic actions rely on suggestion

“when i count to three you will..”

..ritual

ritual can be seen as a tool for creating states of mind and caus­ing ‘appropritate’ behaviour and actions.

Psychedelic drug experiences can be heavilly affected by ‘set­ting’ that is the circumstances in which the drugs are taken, this includes the physical environment (e.g. indoors or outdoors, natural or urban) and who you are with (e.g. close friends or hos­tile strangers). Aside from setting the other major influence is the ‘set’, the state of mind of the user. Set and setting often determine whether a trip goes well or badly, and more than that how fun, useful or therapeutic a trip turns out to be.

Almost any given socially constructed situation implies an appro­priate behaviour or action.

Setting can provoke an intended state of mind and an intended behaviour or action.

Setting then can be seen as analagous to the hypnotists idea of suggestion

hypnotists maintain that people are succeptible to suggestion whether they are in a trance or not, and that suggestion can be encoded into a real or imaginary situation.

A trance allows the suggestion to be built out in the imagination of the subject rather than having to directly encode it into the environment.

Ritual as a tool is creating setting to induce set, direct a trip and manifest and reinforce a required reality

it can consequently be seen as a form of familiar form of spell casting.

Rituals can be built out of place and time, particular spatial organi­sations (architecture), clothing, forms of words, movement and behaviour,

a ritual can take the form of a trigger, causing the recall of an imprinted set

at a climbing gym before attempting a difficult route you might go through a ritual to get into a focused and positive frame of mind, the ritual may have practical value in that you calm your breath and stretch but going through the same pattern before each climbe may also trigger a frame of mind linked to previous suc­cess.

constructing a ritual can create a framework for sanctioning a required state of mind and encode and provoke a required out­come.

[see ‘future ritual’ by phil farber]

divination

Methods of divination often involve the symbolic externalisation of forces active in the individual and in life.

Tarot cards combine archetypes with a chance element which is to some degree controlled by the reader. Which cards turn up and the arrangement of those cards give insight into the question which provoked the reading.

mesa [power objects laid out on the ground]

Every curandero has his ‘mesa’ [...] a collection of numerous power objects laid out on the ground in altar-like fashion for the curing sessions. The objects are of either positive or negative nature. The mesa symbolizes the duality of the world of man and nature and of the spiritual realm, as manifested in the struggle between good and evil. The opposites among the power objects are complementary rather than irreconcilable, rather like two sides of a coin.

To the curandero, the existence of opposite forces does not mean splitting the world in two (the ‘sacred’ and ‘profane’) or establishing a rigid dichotomy between ‘this’ world of matter and the ‘other’ world of the spirit. On the contrary, the curandero seeks to perceive unity in the dynamic interaction between the forces of good and evil through the attainment of ‘vision’. Such a view of the world is very flexible and adaptable; it leaves room for the acceptance of new symbols and ideas and allows competing elements to enter into one’s structuring of reality and the behaviour determined by such structuring.

[...]

A witch or sorcerer would use this negative zone for sorcery or curing for lucrative gain; a benevolent curer like Galvaez needs it for consultation in cases of witchcraft, adverse love magic, or bad luck, since this is the realm responsible for such evils and consequently capable of revealing their sources

five classical magickal acts

Peter Carroll in Liber Kaos describes five classical magickal acts:

evocation [summoning entities for assistance] divination [e.g. tarot, i ching] enchantment [imposing your will on reality] invoca­tion [taking the form of, or being possessed by, an archetypal form or spirit] illumination [changing yourself using magick]

Peter Carroll describes basic sorcery as the creation of “artifacts, tools and instruments which interact magically with the physical world and which can be used again in more subtle ways on other levels”

[really you want to be aware of it but skip past the whole siddhis thing and work on body focused energy work]

shamanism

A shaman is a medicine man, a healer, a creator and a fixer of worlds.

A shaman has highly developed esoteric energy intelligence

A shaman is a traveller, someone who exists in more worlds than others see.

A shaman uses gnosis (trance states and dreams) to effect change

the world we perceive is a subset of the worlds to be perceived, changing what or how we choose to perceive changes the world we live in. Huxley, Mckenna and Castenada all talk in terms that imply that the psychedelic experience is a removal of the brain valve or ego filter, a route to other forms of awareness. Castenada talks in terms of the assemblage point, the group of emanations that an individual chooses to see, an individuals reality. He talks in terms of developing new forms of attentiveness, increasing awareness, escaping socially conditioned perception and arbitrary ‘ordinary’ words. He emphasises stopping the world and learning how to see differently. If our awareness has no filter we become incapacitated and overwhelmed, so the subsequent emphasis is on learning how to scan and group emanations into useful worlds at any given moment. A shaman can move the assemblage points of others.

 

A shaman makes deals, for example with the plant allies that allow him to see or travel or heal.

curandero

What emerges from many hours of taped conversation with Galvaez and participation in his curing sessions is that the hallucinogenic San Pedro cactus is experienced as the catalyst that enables the curandero to transcend the limitations placed on ordinary mortals: to activate all the senses; project his spirit or soul; ascend and descend into the supernatural realms; identify and do battle with the sources of illness, witchcraft and misfortune; confront and vanquish ferocious animals and demons of disease and sorcerers who direct them ‘jump over’ barriers of time, space and matter; divine the past, present and future – in short to attain vision, ‘to see’. And ‘seeing’, in the sense in which this word is used by the curandero, is very different from ‘looking at’.

evolution of magic[k]al technology

Location aware devices will be the first generation of a new tech­nological era, one in which a community will be able to collectively and dynamically impose invisible interpretations and community associations on any given place without physically altering it.

You can carry the externalised assumptions of your community with you instead of having to carve those assumptions into the physcial environment.

Consequently magickal technology as it becomes progressively more advanced will give ever greater individual and community determined control over externally and internally perceived set and setting.

media evolution is linked to efforts to make the physical and com­munity defined environment more plastic, to bring alternative (or dominant) models and assumptions into spaces that might encode different models and assumptions

printing presses, photography, cinema, music technology, radio, TV, computer games, web based content and communities, video projectors, cell phones…tagging, decoration, shelter building, festivals, signage, money

All these primitive early stage magickal technologies have in some way been harnessed by people grappling with the problem of making the built and community defined environment plastic and controllable.

occult and technological expansion of our ideas of what we are or might be

location aware devices are an occult project in the sense that they allow externalised portable support systems for whatever belief system you happen to be experimenting with at the time,

they will allow individuals and communities to secede from con­ventional ideas of what a space means or what we are or might be.

they represent the further evolution of external tools that acknowl­edge and support exploration and interaction with other realities.

create worlds of belief inside yourself and then externalise them.

magick vs cellphones

“when i was almost too small to remember I used to have this nurse in Haiti, a real magickal woman. This friend of hers used to sometimes go into town to the shops for her. If she’d forgot­ten to ask for something, she would walk into the garden and put her hand on this particular mango tree (with me in other arm) and she’d say ‘3 bags of sugar’ or whatever it was she needed and always they’d return with what she’d asked for. Years later I went back and saw her. She had a cell phone. I asked her about the mango tree, and she told me it still worked but the cell phone magic was more reliable.’”

dreams

cooking

“we have all the ingredients but we still don’t know what we’re cooking” Douglas Adams

life flows into inanimate objects

“Life not content with it’s own province, had flowed incontinently into the stones, river, stars and all the natural elements:

the external environment, because it was immediately part of man, remained capricious, mischievous, a reflection of his own disordered urges and fears.” Lewis Mumford

gods for everything

In antiquity there were gods for everything, rivers, streams, trees, and animals.

This anthropomorphic view of the world made the external world an extension of man himself.

A whole new layer of information overlaying the world functions in the same way.

Precedents and models for a world like this stretch from science fiction and the occult to drug experiences and the myths and leg­ends of ancient cultures.

every culture lives within its dream

“Every culture lives within its dream. It is reality while the sleep lasts, a culture lives within an objective world that goes on through its sleeping or waking, and sometimes breaks into the dream, like a noise, to modify it or to make further sleep impossible.”

“The dream gives direction to human activity and both expresses the inner urge of the organism and conjures up appropriate goals.”

Lewis Mumford

collective dreams as structuring agents

Culture is a dream, a set of arbitrary collectively agreed upon conventions. That dream is imposed upon reality. Everything in the built environment reflects upon how the collective sees itself. Visually appreciable characteristics and conventions vary between neighbourhoods, cities and states. Immigrant communities living together bring with them their own dream and overlay it on what they find (china towns, Latin quarters).

This externalised dream extends deep, if you have never stepped outside your culture, you may not notice how much of your world is mediated by an arbitrary dream.

collective dreams as structuring agents [science and politics are part of the dream]

Science, technology, art, literature, politics etc.

merging dream world and real world

We will be able to alter and experiment with the cultural inter­pretation and structuring of the physical world without physically altering it.

‘He told me of how his real life and his dream life are becoming much the same.’

to make dreams truth and fables histories

“This was the sad ambience, the bitter, depleted world in which Lewis and Tolkien wrote. They had, however, a more positive response to these conditions and events than the postimperial stoicism, cultural despair, and resigned Christian pessimism that were the response of their British contemporaries. They were not prepared imaginatively and intellectually to withdraw and accept defeat. Out of the medieval Norse, Celtic, and Grail legends, they conjured fantasies of revenge and recovery, an ethos of return and triumph. As Chaucer said in Troilus and Criseyde, they aimed “to make dreams truth and fables histories” Inventing the Middle Ages, Norman F Cantor 1991

are there plants?

“We offer a simple test for otherworldly explorations: are there plants in the realm? And if there are, what is their status.

In natural, inhabitory societies everyone is a plant person. Sure, there are exceptions – the Eskimos lived entirely by eating other souls – but those are exceptions. To walk through the Amazonian forest with the Waorani or the Quichua speaking peoples is to be deluged with plant lore: with names, uses, and legends about plant after plant after tree passing by.”

Pharmako/poeia – Plants, Posions and Herbcraft by Dale Pendell, mercury house san francisco 1995

does a firm persuasion of a thing make it so?

Then I asked: “does a firm perswasion that a thing is so, make it so ?” He replied: “All poets believe that it does, & in ages of imagination this firm perswasion removed mountains; but many are not capable of a perswasion of anything.” William Blake

a new cathedral

We can experiment without needing to alter.

Think of this analogy in terms of real space. How much does it cost to build a new cathedral? Is the cost affordable for a small distributed community of relatively poor teenagers? How much to alter and convert an existing building to some new purpose?

What if you could alter and convert real space and real spaces to serve your purpose without a legal change of ownership or real construction work.

merely trying to occur

“They are merely trying to occur, they are checking whether the ground of reality can carry them. And they quickly withdraw, fearing to lose their integrity in the frailty of realization. And if they break into their capital, lose a thing or two in these attempts at incarnation, then soon, jealously, they retrieve their possessions, call them in, reintegrate: as a result, white spots appear in our biography-scented stigmata, the faded silvery imprints of the bare feet of angels, scattered footmarks on our nights and days – while the fullness of life waxes, incessantly supplements itself, and towers over us in wonder and wonder…” Bruno Schulz – Cinnamon Streets

Teilhard de Chardin wrote about this enterprise many years ago and would be appalled by the prosaic nature of the tools we will use to bring it about. But I think there is something sweetly ironic that the ladder to his Omega Point might be built by engineers and not mystics.” John Perry Barlow

framing and annotating nature

beauty is largely outside art galleries, and it should be unobtru­sively sign posted

beauty outside

If art is about making us see what the artist wants us to see (Duchamp) then annotating nature could be art.

yugen

“To achieve the end of yugen, art had sometimes been stripped of its color and glitter lest these externals distract; a bowl of highly polished silver reflects more than it suggests, but one of oxidized silver has the mysterious beauty of stillness, as Seami realized when he used for stillness the simile of snow piling in a silver bowl. Or one may prize such a bowl for the tarnished quality itself, for its oldness, for its imperfection, and this is the point where we feel sabi. [...] The love for the fallen flower, for the moon obscured by the rain, for the withered bough, is part of sabi. Unlike yugen (to which, however, it is not opposed) sabi does not find in these things symbols of remoter eternities. They are themselves and capable in themselves of giving deep pleasure. Sabi also differs from the gentle melancholy of aware: here one does not lament for the fallen flower, one loves it.” Tsunoda, et al, Sources of Japanese Tradition

making the stone stony

“And art exists that one may recover the sensation of life; it exists to make one feel things, to make the stone STONY. The purpose of art is to impart the sensation of things as they are perceived and not as they are known. The technique of art is to make objects “unfamiliar,” to make forms difficult, to increase the difficulty and length of perception because the process of perception is an aesthetic end in itself and must be prolonged.” Victor Shklovsky, Art As Technique

churinga [temporary and permanent]

The twofold nature of ownership characterizes all secret-sacred objects (churinga) and sites of mythological and ritual significance (Dreamings). For example among the Aranda each individual had a personal stone or wood churinga kept in a sacred ‘storehouse’ of the ritual group. The churinga is a lifeline to the spirit world and the dreaming – and people belong to it. The ‘storehouse’ may be a hole in the ground (where the churinga is buried), a hollow tree, a cleft in a rock or a shed of branches. In any case it is concealed from view and the whole area around it is forbidden to women, children and the uninitiated on pain of death.Thus while the concept of a sacred storehouse resembles that of other cultures, it is not expressed by building, and, rather than being stressed, is hidden.

A similar relationship exists between ritual groups and natural or artificially constructed Dreamings – standing stones, rock masses, waterholes, trees or stone arrangements. These are permanent and symbolic assurances of the presence of the Dreaming which are the very ground of being and keep the world going. The whole world is a single entity the main characteristic of which is reciprocity.

[...]

There is thus a clear distinction between sacred and profane, very much as Eliade suggests, even though there are no visible physical demarcations. For example when churingas were kept in caves, those entering to fetch them impressed palm prints near the entrance to establish rites of passage” indicating an awareness of a boundary between sacred and profane. In fact any place where churingas are kept becomes sacred, and the churinga is shown to initiates as a rite of passage giving rebirth into full membership of the clan. Similarly, ceremonial leaders frequently become such in special caves whereas other people who entered these caves could disappear forever. There are thus a number of rites of passage related to environmental features.

Some sacred places are specially related to the conception of children. When a woman conceives in a place where there are prominent features – rocks, boulders, ancient trees – one of the spirit children of the place enters her body and the totem of this place becomes the child’s irrespective of the father’s or mother’s totem. This shows the importance of the place of conception and the individual retains a special relationship to the natural feature and would worry if the tree was to be cut down or the rock mined.

[...]

Many descriptions and illustrations exist of ceremonies all showing the great variety, richness and complexity of the temporary ‘monuments’ used – body decorations, shields, poles, crosses and the like. Various markers may be erected, rocks emphasized by having blood poured on them or special bough huts built in which men spend much time during,ceremonials.” During some ceremonials big fires are lit as ‘temporary monuments’.

The various forms of body decorations are extremely complex involving painting, covering the body with down stuck with blood and so on as well as the use of extremely complex, elaborate and tall head gear. People so decorated could be seen as ‘temporary monuments’ claiming a place by making it sacred through linking it with myth.

 

[...]

While Western man relies on barriers to keep out nature, reduce differences between seasons and times and defines places by manipulating these barriers, aborigines define places by knowing them and their distinctions. This knowledge is perceptual and ‘real’ as well as associational, mythical and symbolic.

network conflict resolution

my god i dont want that

“Location aware device conversations often go like this: You explain the basic idea of location awareness: that is, that your cell phone will know where it is, and they go ‘MY GOD, I DON’T WANT THAT.’ And the conversation ends there. The reality is that the people who run the networks already know where your cell phone is to within a few hundred metres. The banks and shops already know from your credit card and store .loyalty. card transactions what you buy, and where you are when you buy it. Companies exist for the sole purpose of tracking your web habits, building files on you and selling that information to advertisers. A friend who used to work for one of the biggest of those companies (a computer science post-graduate specialising in privacy and encryption) just shakes his head and keeps saying .evil. when­ever you ask him about his former employer (he left voluntarily). Your bank statements, your web profile, the cell phone towers you switch between, and your behavioural idiosyncrasies (and banalities), can all find there way into a file. They know where you are, where you were and have a reasonably good idea where you will be. They can know where everyone is except the people who tread carefully and the list of people who tread carefully is probably the worst one to be on. Oh, and as one Slashdot reader pointed out, it isn.t good enough to turn your cell phone off you have to remove the battery, or better still tape the phone to the bottom of a greyhound bus headed in the other direction.

The location aware device stories that get into the mass media go: Strap bracelets to children and convicts; the more optimistic ones tell you how you can use this technology to get your BMW back. More recently they point out that in-car navigation systems can help you find the nearest McDonalds or 76.

The Teamsters union have clear policies on how and when loca­tion sensing can be used to track their members, and don.t leave it up to the employer to decide. Organised, aware people help define this reality.

Until the internet arrived, broadcast media ruled, TV, newspapers, and publishers talked to us and we couldn.t talk back on equal terms. The .one to many. function of the internet, and now all of a sudden cell phones, has changed that.

The one thing that hasn.t happened is the localisation of these tools.

Location aware devices are a way to extend our capacity to talk to each other, and not just to some bunch of people spread all over the world but to the real next door people wherever you happen to be.

It.s not that you have to meet them all. Non-contact communica­tion is an important concept in this argument. Non-contact com­munication is stuff like war-chalking or hobo code. An example: homeless in the US in the 1920.s a guy finds a good place that.s safe to sleep, when he wakes up he leaves a chalk mark on the ground. Another homeless person comes along reads the hobo coded message and understands that this is a good place to sleep. Another example, a laptop user with 802.11 wireless LAN card walking down the street in San Francisco sees a chalk mark on the pavement, she sits down on the sidewalk next to the war chalk, flips open her laptop, and checks her email using the wire­less connection the chalk told her was there.

These examples illustrate the way that location aware devices could be used to get people to communicate with each other on a local level to mutual advantage if they both do some chalking.

Location aware devices don.t use chalk. But you can leave mes­sages about anything on the sidewalk, or anywhere else. If you want examples or you don.t know what location aware devices are you can find both on this site.

Your location is already being tracked. You could make good use of that information if you could get it and had a system for making use of it. Location services are a potential source of revenue for cash hungry mobile network providers so they are going to tell you where you are, and even if you ignore them they.ll still know; unless you throw away your much loved brand new super techni­cal phone and stop using your credit cards.

The real issues are awareness and development, whether loca­tion information gets fed through an open source, peer to peer, encrypted system set up to help people help each other, or whether we just get to know where the nearest McDonalds is.

Asking people to think beyond ‘MY GOD I DON’T WANT THAT’ seems reasonable.

Anyway, us talking to each other is more scary than them knowing where we are, God knows what’s going to happen.”

social self organisation

When people consider the dangers of the chaos of a free intensely networked spatially augmented augmented world, they should also consider that like all technological advances it offers tools to both sides of any argument. ‘ends appropriate means’ may seem ominous but the ends can just as well be social advancement. Even in a critical situation, disaster response and recovery in a world of spontaneous peer to peer mesh networks, running evolved social software, seems like a sane option for coordination of local efforts to recover and help from outside. The homeland security initiative raised the point that a citizen owned spatially aware communications network could be invaluable in a crisis.

People self organise for all kinds of reasons and geomesh net­works offer any number of socially and personally advantageous opportunities.

Catching people who want to hurt other people could be made a lot easier with local communities watching out for themselves according to local and personal value systems instead of or sup­plementing often alienating top down invasive tactical operations.

[...] Second, experience shows that redundant communications are extremely important in crisis situations. Multi-modal communications are crucial to crisis operations. Terrestrial networks may fail during a catastrophic event. Wireless networks provide additional choices, including cellular packet, radio packet, and satellite networks.

balance between the liberating and controlling aspects of technology

technology is not inherently liberating.

If location aware devices reach the mass market in a form that does not cryptographically protect the user, governments and corporations are soon going to know exactly where everyone is in real time.

local law

“According to Lawrence Lessig, a Stanford law professor, the notion that governments can’t regulate [the internet] hangs upon a particular architecture of the Net. As the Internet’s architecture changes and becomes more complex, with the addition of services like filtering and geolocation, the idea that the Internet is beyond the reach of local laws and government regulation looks less and less tenable.”

states and companies with computers vs individuals with computers

“Telecommunications equipment and computers have tended to centralize the power held by the top officials in both government and private industry. Computer experts often reject this complaint. They contend that the rapid growth in the use of personal computers by millions of American citizens will cancel out the increases in power flowing to the large organisations. This defence has surface plausibility, but when the vast capital, expertise and manpower available to the large government and business organisations are compared to the capital, expertise and available working time of even the most favoured individual, the personal computer does not appear to be a great equaliser. Furthermore, who controls what information is stored in the great data bases of the united states and who serves as the gatekeeper to most of the giant communications networks.”

“According to fashionable new police jargon, espoused by both police and their radical critics, policing is ‘merely a subsystem of the total system of social control’. That description of ‘the job’ was given in 1985 by Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Kenneth Newman, as the police and home office jointly promoted new multiple agency ideas about crime control. Comprising the ‘total system of social control’ are central government departments, including the DHSS; employment, education and environment ministries; and local government agencies, including housing, education, planning and social services. Commissioner Newman’s systems theory was a fair summary of the police approach to the search for a new role in the community during the 1980’s”

“Robert Steele is a US intelligence officer with eighteen years experience, including tours with the CIA as a clandestine field officer. Four years ago, he was in charge of setting up a new US $20 million computerized intelligence centre for the Marines.

 

It was to be linked to the CIA’s central database of classified information. When the connection was made, Steele eagerly began sending queries from the Marine network to the CIA, requesting the kind of data Marines want to know, such as “What was the turning radius for ships in Brazilian ports? How much weight could the bridges of Jordan withstand?” To Steele’s utter shock, the CIA database proved useless. No one had warned him that the classified information he and thousands of other CIA operatives had been generating for years was, in the main, worthless.

From that moment, Steele’s epiphany has lead to a personal crusade to eradicate the secrecy that plagues the intelligence apparatus. Steele discovered he could have found immediate and correct answers to his queries on the ‘open’ market of information – commercial databases, academic sources, and public computer networks. “Secrecy,” Steele says, “corrupts truth.” The 50,000 bureaucrats in the intelligence community believe, he adds, “that if it is not a secret, it’s not worth knowing.” Yet Steele quotes internal studies that show up to 75 percent of classified information is available from open sources at an incredibly cheaper cost.”

[concludes with a conference announcement: “The keynote speaker will be Alvin Toffler. Also four former KGB officers will explain how they used open sources in the US to learn almost everything they needed.”]

subversiveness networks

Not only civil society but also “uncivil society” is benefiting from the rise of network forms of organization. Some uncivil actors, such as terrorists and criminals, are having little difficulty forming highly networked, nonhierarchical organizations.

“I bomb, therefore I am.”

Terrorism enables a perpetrator to publicize his identity, project it explosively, and touch the nerves of powerful distant leaders. This kind of attraction to violence transcends its instrumental utility. Mainstream revolutionary writings may view violence as a means of struggle, but terrorists often regard violence as an end in itself that generates identity or damages the enemy’s identity.

Netwar figures increasingly at the societal end of the spectrum, where the language has normally been about low-intensity conflict (LIC), operations other than war (OOTW), and nonmilitary modes of conflict and crime.

Hierarchies have a difficult time fighting networks. There are examples across the conflict spectrum. Some of the best are found in the failings of governments to defeat transnational criminal cartels engaged in drug smuggling, as in Colombia.

Most adversaries that the United States and its allies face in the realms of low-intensity conflict-international terrorists, guerrilla insurgents, drug smuggling cartels, ethnic factions, as well as racial and tribal gangs-are all organized like networks (although their leadership may be quite hierarchical). Perhaps a reason that military (and police) institutions keep having difficulty engaging in low-intensity conflicts is because they are not meant to be fought by institutions.

Cyberwar may imply a new view not only of what constitutes “attack” but also of “defeat.”

the c[four]isr architecture

Activities with the C4ISR architecture are being prioritized and held under the auspices centrally within the Department of Defense.

The C4IsR architecture being developed and which is necessary for implementation of JV 2010, has the following components:

o A robust, multi-sensor network, for achieving Dominant Battlespace Awareness (DBA) – information superiority.

o A common communications system with sufficient ability, inclusive speed and ECM jamming, as support for operations.

o An advanced “command and control” function that enables rapid deployment and logistics support to troops (faster than an opponent’s).

o A “sensor-to-shooter” system that integrates air defence, precision weapons and enables more effective battle damage assessment.

o A global information defence system for active protection of own sensors positioned globally and communication networks from enemy interference or exploitation.

o The capability for information operations which enable us to either penetrate or mislead an opponent’s corresponding systems, thus preventing information superiority with an opponent.

cu chulaind

fidchell

At that Cu Chulaind’s riastarthae overcame him

so that the air was full of their blood

[...]

The man has long, braided beautiful hair; his face is half red and half white and bright and glistening all over. His cloak is dark blue and crimson.

“Not to avoid danger have we come,” said Cu Chulaind

[...]

Then his riastarthae came upon him. You would have thought that every hair was being driven into his head. You would have thought that a spark of fire was on every hair. He closed one eye until it was no wider than the eye of a needle; he opened the other until it was as big as a wooden bowl. He bared his teeth from jaw to ear, and he opened his mouth until his gullet was visible. The warrior’s moon rose from his head.

[...]

Cu Chulaind cast his spear at Foill and broke his back and took his head and his weapons.

Cu Chulaind cast his spear at Tuachell, and the latters limbs collapsed; he went and struck Tuachell’s head off and gave the head and spoils to Ibor.

[...]

then his riastarthae came over him: a drop of blood appeared at the tip of each hair, and he drew his hair into his head, so that, from above, his jet-black locks appeared to have been cropped with scissors; he turned like a mill wheel, and he stretched himself out until a warrior’s foot could fit between each pair of ribs.

“Not difficult, that” she answered

He cast it at the boy through the water, and the boy’s innards fell at his feet.

sixteen thousand tons of pure symbolism

“Today the USAF, despite being the richest organisation of its kind anywhere, can scarcely afford to buy more than 100 fighters annually. At up to $500 million apiece – the price of a single ‘stealth’ bomber – so rare are modern weapons systems that, like some fake antiques, they have to be virtually hand crafted. Since new major systems seldom reach operational status at planned cost, there is always a tendency to pare numbers and stretch programs, causing per-unit price to escalate. Once the weapons exist they are too expensive to be tested or trained with, so that simulators have to be used. Finally, when low-intensity conflict does break out and the opportunity to use the hardware presents itself, it seems wasteful to employ such expensive systems against persons who are often an illiterate rabble, and who are not even regular soldiers. As a result, in Lebanon for example, the US Navy’s first air-strike (leading to the loss of two aircraft, total value perhaps $60 million) was also the last. Summa summarum, already today only one country can afford to own more than a handful of these systems; nor does even the US intend to replace those lost in the Gulf.”

future war

“one important way in which human societies of any kind develop their internal structure has been through fighting other societies.”

“In another sense, the question as to what future societies war for is almost irrelevant. It is simply not true that war is solely a means to an end, nor do people necessarily fight in order to attain

 

this objective or that. In fact, the opposite is true: people very often take up one objective or another precisely in order that they may fight. While the usefulness of war as a means of gaining practical ends may well be questioned, its ability to entertain, to inspire, and to fascinate has never been in doubt. War is life written large. Among the things that move between the two poles, war alone both permits and demands the commitment of all man’s faculties, the highest as well as the lowest. The brutality and the ruthlessness, the courage and the determination, the sheer power that strategy considers necessary for the conduct of armed conflict are at the same time its causes. Literature, art, games, and history all bear eloquent testimony to the same elemental fact. One very important way in which men can attain joy, freedom, happiness, even delirium and ecstasy, is not by staying at home with wife and family, even to the point where, often enough, they are only too happy to give up their nearest and dearest in favour of war.”

“Other specialist methods of parachuting have been developed. HALO has spawned HAHO (High Altitude High Opening). This allows the parachutist to be under the canopy shortly after leaving the aircraft. Its advantage over HALO is that the parachutist can take advantage of the forward drive of the canopy to travel many miles over the ground. This allows for the aircraft to drop the troops without having to overfly the target, whereas for HALO this is not the case.”

stowaway

“A man (they swore they had known him) had planned to stow away on a boat bound for Chile. It was laden with manufactured goods packed in big wooden crates, and with the help of a docker the stowaway had managed to hide himself in one of these. But the docker had made a mistake about the order in which the crates were to be loaded. The crane gripped the stowaway, swung him aloft, and deposited him – at the very bottom of the hold, beneath hundreds of crates. No one discovered what had happened until the end of the voyage, when they found the stowaway rotting, dead of suffocation.”

counter culture research and development

counter culture research and development

The spatial and social weirdness that location aware devices are going to make possible is prefigured by the spatial and social experimentation of the counter-culture.

Since the 1960’s the counter-culture has functioned as a much-needed r&d department for western societies.

The counter-culture explored alternatives to dominant forms of social and spatial organisation ..emphasising: temporary, sponta­neous, mobile, communal, free, sharing, heterarchical, networked, autonomous.

It consciously explored the plasticity of the built environment, social structures and technology; it’s explorations were spatial, imaginative, communal and constructive.

It set an agenda, which is far from complete, and only just becom­ing technically feasible.

The counter-culture has been (and still is) experimenting with new technology and new ways of using space and organising community, and this despite the extent and violence of opposition it has faced.

From Haight Ashbury to Burning Man, only the US military can claim to have been as curious, radical or as irresponsible in exploring the social and spatial possibilities offered by new technology.

Despite being troublesome and deniable at the time, the most disruptive counter-culture ideas usually find themselves assimi­lated into mainstream thought.

experimentation

The counter-culture has been experimenting with social organisa­tion, it has explored, invented and colonised new and old spaces.

continuity

a continuous line can be drawn from the 60’s to the present day

trace root

“The dominant narrative of failure of the sixties counterculture is frequently repeated in books about it. Dates in titles of books signal this: Elizabeth Nelson’s The British Counter-Culture, 1966-73, Nigel Fountain’s Underground: The London Alternative Press 1966-74, Alan Beam’s Rehearsal For The Year 2000 . . . 1966-1976. The cut-off dates alter, but there’s a general reluctance to pursue the alternative project via any actions of the next generation. These books display a shortening gap between the bemoaned ‘end’ of the counterculture and the straggly dyed green shoots of the next youth antagonism, punk rock. Fountain and Nelson are particularly guilty here: the focus of both their texts is the underground press, yet neither even mentions the explosion of fanzine culture which accompanied and contributed to the energy of the punk scene, clearly a prime example of an underground press. Not all hippy activists or writers about the scene are so myopic. In 1972, the underground publication Frendz optimistically proclaimed ‘if flower-power has gone to seed then germination must soon begin. And what King Weeds they’ll be’.”

“[the] utopian project of the sixties is still with us – in fact it never really went away.”

exploration

haight

In the late 1960’s Haight Ashbury, a cross-street in san francisco, became the consensus epicentre of a new counter-culture.

Media coverage resulted in a massive migration which the original community was unable to absorb.

The experience made clear the difficulty of maintaining a viable, permanent, fixed geographical centre to such a provocative and attractive international movement.

In 1965 LSD was legal.

“To a psychedelic eye in the sky, the Bay Area would have looked like a maze of tiny puddles of acidheads, each ignorant of the others. The Red Dog Saloon was one place where people could get an inkling – from out in Nevada – of how big it was becoming. [1965]

the superficial aspects

“They came to the Haight,” a handbill relates, “with a great need and a great hunger for a loving community. Many, wanting to belong, identified with the superficial aspects of what ‘hippie’ was. They didn’t drop out but rather changed roles.

“As a result the tone of Haight-Asbbury changed. With many people coming in expecting to be fed and housed, the older community tried to fulfill their needs. Rather than asking them to do their thing, the community tried to give them what they came for. The community tried to be something it wasn’t.

“The early members tried to save the community and as a result it began to die. It began to die because in the effort to save it the individuals lost themselves. Without individual selves the community started to become a shell with little within; to maintain the community feeling, meetings replaced relationships and organization replaced community.

“By the end of the summer we were forming organizations to save something that no longer existed. Community is a creative thing and saving is only a holding action. By desperate clinging, we lost.”

from Don Mcneill, Village Voice, Nov 30 1967

keep moving

“I lived a block above Haight street for two years, but by the end of ‘66 the whole neighborhood had become a cop-magnet and a bad sideshow. Between the narks and the psychedelic hustlers, there was not much room to live.”

This pattern became part of counter culture methodology, tempo­rary has become a doctrine and a virtue.

temporary, like concerts, and not enduring like the pyramids

“I imagine a future architecture in which you turn on a building the way we now turn on the lights. These buildings will be temporary, like concerts, and not enduring like the pyramids; and so when the use of the building is finished, the people can move on. The culture will be similar to the nomadic way of life of the old Paleolithic hunters and gatherers; the people will carry their culture in their souls, and so familiar will they be with earth, wind, and stars that civilization will be unnecessary.” William Irwin Thompson, Darkness and Scattered Light

diggers [free cities]

Theater is territory. A space for existing outside padded walls. Setting down a stage declares a universal pardon for imagination. But what happens next must mean more than sanctuary or preserve. How would real wardens react to life-actors on liberated ground? How can the intrinsic freedom of theater illuminate walls and show the weak-spots where a breakout could occur?

Guerrilla theater intends to bring audiences to liberated territory to create life-actors. It remains light and exploitative of forms for the same reasons that it intends to remain free. It seeks audiences that are created by issues. It creates a cast of freed beings. It will become an issue itself.

This is theater of an underground that wants out. Its aim is to liberate ground held by consumer wardens and establish territory without walls. Its plays are glass cutters for empire windows.

Free store/property of the possessed

The Diggers are hip to property. Everything is free, do your own thing. Human beings are the means of exchange. Food, machines, clothing, materials, shelter and props are simply there. Stuff. A perfect dispenser would be an open Automat on the street. Locks are time-consuming. Combinations are clocks. [Check this: “locks” in the 10/66 edition?]

So a store of goods or clinic or restaurant that is free becomes a social art form. Ticketless theater. Out of money and control.

“First you gotta pin down what’s wrong with the West. Distrust of human nature, which means distrust of Nature. Distrust of wildness in oneself literally means distrust of Wilderness.” –Gary Snyder

Diggers assume free stores to liberate human nature. First free the space, goods and services. Let theories of economics follow social facts. Once a free store is assumed, human wanting and giving, needing and taking, become wide open to improvisation.

A sign: If Someone Asks to See the Manager Tell Him He’s the Manager.

Someone asked how much a book cost. How much did he think it was worth? 75 cents. The money was taken and held out for anyone. “Who wants 75 cents?” A girl who had just walked in came over and took it.

A basket labeled Free Money.

No owner, no Manager, no employees and no cash-register. A salesman in a free store is a life-actor. Anyone who will assume an answer to a question or accept a problem as a turn-on.

Question (whispered): “Who pays the rent?”

Answer (loudly): “May I help you?”

Who’s ready for the implications of a free store? Welfare mothers pile bags full of clothes for a few days and come back to hang up dresses. Kids case the joint wondering how to boost.

 

Fire helmets, riding pants, shower curtains, surgical gowns and World War I Army boots are parts for costumes. Nightsticks, sample cases, water pipes, toy guns and weather balloons are taken for props. When materials are free, imagination becomes currency for spirit.

Where does the stuff come from? People, persons, beings. Isn’t it obvious that objects are only transitory subjects of human value? An object released from one person’s value may be destroyed, abandoned or made available to other people. The choice is anyone’s.

The question of a free store is simply: What would you have?

the underground press

Underground presses, and advances in printing technology played a major role in organising communities and spaces, and express­ing alternatives.

By the end of the 1960’s radical underground presses were sup­porting, informing and holding together a rapidly expanding alter­native community. Music, free festivals, political radicalism and the back to the land movement all relied for an uncensored voice on the ability to self-publish.

The FBI went to considerable lengths to undermine and destabi­lise the more radically inclined presses, coordinating damaging raids with pressure on advertisers in order to force them out of business.

Through underground presses, individuals and groups could bypass mainstream media and publish, uncensored, what would otherwise have spread only by word of mouth, functioning as precursors to the free for all of the uncensored internet and the formalised word of mouth of the Lonely Planet’s.

[Avatar, IT, Oz, the Whole Earth Catalog, Rolling Stone, Inner Space, Shelter.][Marshal Mcluhan]

underground media

The post 1960’s counter-culture has expressed itself through a succession of new technologies, photocopied zines, desktop publishing, the internet.

The internet has made possible organised archives of alternative information [vaults of erowid etc]

Lonely Planet is online

There are syndicated alternative/protest media to rival mainstream

news networks [indymedia]

Mailing lists and websites support marginal interests of every conceivable character.

Cheap access to tools for making music, film and printed matter mean that the range of media, and the number of people with access, have massively increased.

Counter-culture’s experimentation with alternative media didn’t die in the early 1970’s..

What maybe died was the idea that consistently alternative and contrary might be everybody’s religion. The counter-culture is an imaginative, creative, international tribe, with an influence disproportionate to it’s size. It is just the r&d department, but what comes out of the r&d department affects how things get done in the future.

The next generation will have location aware devices that will allow direct invisible collective marking, demarcating and annotat­ing of space.

from communes to open source

In the 1970’s there was a ‘back to the land’ movement, hippies moved out of urban envi­ronments into the ‘countryside’. This was in part an expression of a more general interest in communal living and self-sufficiency.

The communal experimentation of the late 60’s and early seventies resulted in some of the most constructive and thoughtful contributions to come out of the counter-culture during the period.

These efforts served to substantiate the hippies claim to be looking for a genuine alternative infrastructure.

The Whole Earth Catalog, set up by Stewart Brand, a biologist who found himself in Tom Wolfe’s Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test as the hippie who noticed that despite the ongoing space program there were no pictures of the earth from space. The pictures that later emerged have been credited with catalysing the environmen­tal movement, creating an awareness of how fragile the earth’s ecosystem might be and challenging the myth of inexhaustible natural resources.

The Whole Earth Catalog’s articulated a political agenda that rejected the ideas of the new left and conventional revolutionary politics in favour of a grass roots revolution based on construc­tive alternative ideas. The catalogs supplied ideas, tools and resources that supported the back to the land movement. They focused on the fledgling interest in ecology and whole systems, the creative exploration of new (and old) technology from house building, to computing to renewable energy, new (old) ideas about internal energy (alternative medicine, yoga, meditation, tai chi, acupressure, acupuncture and massage).

Shelter, another great publication from the period, focused on architecture without architects, documenting small scale self-build­ing techniques, ranging from historical, international and hippie house building experimentation.

“Nobody heckles a hippy when he’s high on work”

The Whole Earth ‘Lectronic Link (the WELL), spun off from the Whole Earth Catalog and was an early (1980’s) and influential California based bulletin board that soon got itself hooked up to the internet. Stewart Brand founded the Hackers conference which brought (and still brings) together a diverse range of com­puter geeks. A former Whole Earth editor Kevin Kelly was the first editor of Wired magazine.

Linux and the open source (free) software movement parallel the ideas that Shelter and Whole Earth exemplify, in that they funda­mentally challenge conventional preconceptions about how things could or should be done.

Linux and free software are infrastructure. Linux and the open source (free) software movement, have, by just building, imposed, de facto, new forms of community, value and exchange. It is hard to marginalise a counter-culture that can offer alternatives that rival the most successful orthodox institutions.

rethinking land

When people from urban environments move into the country they can find themselves feeling out of place.

When the hippies headed back to the land they brought a belief system with them that was often at odds with that of the communities they moved into. Locals often largely perceived agricultural land in the context of work, and maximised produc­tion. The hippies brought in new ideas about how they would live, what the land meant to them and how it should be worked. This inevitably led to a harsh dialogue, if not a direct conflict. Organic farming is one result of this argument.

The hippies who went back to the land in the seventies were often highly intelligent and hard working, land was relatively cheap so that now many of the communes that survived are land owning and relatively financially secure. Many hippy intentional communi­ties failed but some like Harbin in northern california and Findhorn in scotland have survived. The evolving survivors often function on different levels, on the one hand as collective communes for long term residents, more or less true to the original founding ideas, and on the other as commercial retreat centres catering to increasingly mainstream interest in yoga, meditation and alterna­tive therapies.

One weirdness is that since the 1980’s the original hippy life­style has been increasingly commercialised and commodified, what were once cheap alternatives are now sold at a premium. ‘Organic’ brown rice is now a luxury item. Whole Foods, a hippy health food supermarket in San Francisco, is probably the single

 

most expensive place to buy groceries in the whole city.

Many of the original hippy’s are wealthy and influential and many of the original hippy motifs have been co-opted as symbols of wealth and power. Whether this is success or failure depends on where you stand.

heuristics

Acupuncture and the whole concept of energy meridians have no basis in modern science [new research is in fact beginning to sug­gest otherwise]. Yet western doctors prescribe and recommend acupuncture and other ‘alternative’ therapies. Western science has no model that supports these ideas.

Mathematicians often arrive at something that is true without being able to describe the logical foundation or the whole chain of reasoning behind that answer, because they don’t know it. Calcu­lus is an example, calculus was used for a hundred years before the logical foundations began to be worked out. It was magic for a hundred years.

The alternative way to look at acupuncture, or calculus in its early stages, or any answer to a mathematical problem that you arrive at, are confident in, but have no clear incontrovertible basis for, is that your solution is heuristic. It as an answer that appears to work, you find a basis for it in parallel to using it.

Heuristics is a classic mathematical problem solving tool. Find the answer any way you can and then find a logical route to that answer. [see Pappus]

intentional communities

‘intentional community’ is a formal way of saying commune.

Intentional communities are interesting as a physical manifesta­tion of community derived from common interest.

Deciding to be together in real life ..after deciding that the idea of being together was worth dragging into reality.

Intentional communities usually get formed by people who have in common, religious, political, artistic, sexual or other fairly utopian ideas.

For many intentional communities, now is a good time, the inter­net making it easier for seekers to find them.

the road to kathmandu

This hirsute new breed of travellers packs a socially disruptive valence way beyond the significance of its numbers.

the Road to Katmandu

A spectre is haunting the world: the spectre of long hair. [...] In May 1967, in a joint statement, the Greek Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Public Order proclaimed: ‘Entry is prohibited of any foreigner who is unclean and not dressed properly.’ [...] The Consulate-General in Istanbul added helpfully: ‘It is not only young

 

men. Young women are also involved.’ He went on to explain that the consulate had to deal with ‘1000 problem youngsters a year’. [...] By December 1967, the virus had struck central Asia. In London, The Times revealed that ‘ “flower people” arriving in Nepal will now receive visas valid for only one week and not renewable.’ A hippie camp near Katmandu was disbanded and the leader deported. [...] May 1968, a group of twenty-two travelers (the first ‘batch’) were expelled by the Laos authorities [...] Before these luckless deportees were admitted to next-door Thailand, they were made to shave their beards and cut their hair. [...] In July 1968, Yugoslavia officially ‘declared war on hippies’ and the Belgrade newspaper Politika Ekspres reported that groups of boys armed with scissors had been forcibly carrying out haircuts on long-haired visitors. [...] In Mexico border guards began turning longhairs back with the words: ‘No hippies, no Jews; on Presidential orders.’ [...] By April 1968, Argentinian police had arrested 133 ‘hippies’ and sheared their hair to crew-cut length. In September, the Turks officially banned ‘ ‘louseniks’ from the country [...] In October 1968, the Times of India reported that: ‘Some New Delhi magistrates are wondering whether there is a sinister pattern behind the hippie invasion of the capital.’ [...] In Marrakesh, the bizarrely beautiful, velvet and satined Western girls tell stories of angry, veiled Arab ladies rushing up, shaking them and asking, ‘Who are you? Who are you? [...] In Bangkok, Western travellers are cleared from cafes by nervous Thais with sub-machine guns [...] ‘Who is in charge of you? What are your plans? Where are your headquarters?’ asked the Greeks when they gaoled Neal Phillips, an American traveller for hash offences [...] Nowhere is inaccessible. They tramp through Africa and South America. In Bangkok I met a couple who had hitch-hiked through China. [...] I met young Americans who had thumbed through South Vietnam, only to be attacked – not by Vietcong – but by ‘Vietnik’-hating, uniformed fellow countrymen [...] It has been estimated that over two thousand British ‘hippies’ passed through Kabul Afghanistan, in 1967

the hippies were out of place

lonley planet

Lonely Planet books grew out of a hippy culture that saw people drop out and travel

The third world has been opened up, by written down word of mouth, to unbelievably large numbers of young westerners with­out much money.

The lonely planet now represents a corridor that now runs throughout the third world, You can stay anywhere along that cor­ridor, meet people like yourself, eat western food, sit in restau­rants watching the latest movies on pirated DVD [while the pigs nuzzle around under the whole in the floor that is the toilet], send your email, buy deoderant, condoms, antibiotics and sunblock, and eventually fly home with a backpack full of fake stussy cloth­ing, tag hauer watches, cracked software, pirated CD’s, difficult to obtain prescription drugs, a hammock and a new sarong.

third world networks

Cyber cafes have sprung up all over the third world not just to service travellers, but also to supply the local business commu­nity and a local middle class hungry for access to computers and email.

Local trade both internal and across international borders benefits from cheap reliable communications.

The general case can be made specific.

Networks are impacting more than just the relatively wealthy west­erners in the third world, at the interface between the travellers and the local population, the local community can leverage the new infrastructure for there own ends.

Small scale manufacturers who used to have trouble keeping in contact with the travellers who came through and ordered stuff to ship back to them in the west can now take reorders by email and bypass the difficulties of time difference, the costs of conventional long distance phone calls and government postal systems. Using the web they can also reach deeper into those markets once they know they exist.

Facilities of every kind (guest houses, diving shops, climbing shops, trekking shops), have websites, often built for them by travellers to make costs cheaper; the sites bring in new business, email keeps them in touch with travllers who have returned home and may come back or tell there friends.

using networked computing in the third world

Once you get past high cost of hardware the software’s free, and its the latest stuff, same software the rest of the world is using, with all the productivity advances that software brings.

You can homebrew anything the west has with a computer. In Kathmandu the stores don’t have tills, they have old computers running till software written in india.

The internet phone revolution has made calling internationally affordable.

Cell phone infrastructure often causes conventional land line sys­tems to be bypassed, leading to isolated areas being able to go from nothing to 21st century infrastructure over night.

three days

“Only 150 years ago, the Great Plains were a vast, waving sea of grass stretching from the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico to the boreal forest of Canada, from the oak-hickory forests of the Ozarks to the Rocky Mountains.

Bison blanketed the plains-it has been estimated that 60 million of the huge, shaggy beasts moved across the grassy ocean in seasonal migrations. Throngs of Pronghom and Elk also filled this Pleistocene landscape. Packs of Gray Wolves and numerous Grizzly Bears followed the tremendous herds.

In 1830, John James Audubon sat on the banks of the Ohio River for three days as a single flock of Passenger Pigeons darkened the sky from horizon to horizon. He estimated that there were several billion birds in that flock. It has been said that a squirrel could travel from the Atlantic seaboard to the Mississippi River without touching the ground so dense was the deciduous forest of the East.

At the time of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, an estimated 100,000 Grizzlies roamed the western half of what is now the United States. The howl of the wolf was ubiquitous. The California Condor sailed the sky from the Pacific Coast to the Great Plains. Salmon and sturgeon populated the rivers. Ocelots, Jaguars, and Jaguarundis prowled the Texas brush and Southwestern mountains and mesas. Bighorn Sheep ranged the mountains of the Rockies, the Great Basin, the Southwest, and the Pacific Coast. Ivory-billed Woodpeckers and Carolina Parakeets filled the steamy forests of the Deep South. The land was alive.

East of the Mississippi, giant Tulip Poplars, American Chestnuts, oaks, hickories, and other trees formed the most diverse temperate deciduous forest in the world. In New England, White Pines grew to heights rivaling the Brobdingnagian conifers of the far West. On the Pacific Coast, redwood, hemlock, Douglas-fir, spruce, cedar, fir, and pine formed the grandest forest on Earth.

In the space of a few generations we have laid waste to paradise. The Tallgrass Prairie has been transformed into a corn factory where wildlife means the exotic pheasant. The Shortgrass Prairie is a grid of carefully fenced cow pastures and wheat fields. The Passenger Pigeon is no more; the last one died in the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914. The endless forests of the East are tame woodlots, With few exceptions, the only virgin deciduous forest there is in tiny rnuseum pieces of hundreds of acres. Fewer than one thousand Grizzlies remain.”

Dave Foreman

“Even wild animals resisted the destruction of their homelands under the hooves of invading livestock. Many of the so-called ‘renegade’ Gray Wolves, who undertook seemingly wanton attacks on cattle and sheep, were the last surviving members of their packs and had seen their fellow pack members trapped and killed. Arizona’s ‘Aguila Wolf’ (‘aguila’ is Spanish for eagle) killed up to 65 sheep in one night. Near Meeker, Colorado, ‘Rags the Digger’ would ruin trap lines by digging up traps without tripping them. Many of these avenging wolves were trap victims themselves, bearing names like ‘Crip’, ‘Two Toes’, ‘Three Toes’, ‘Peg Leg’, and ‘Old Lefty.’

Whole communities would marshal their resources to kill the last of the wolves. ‘Three Toes of Harding County’ eluded over 150 men in 13 years of attacking livestock in South Dakota. As recently as 1920, a trapper worked for eight months to kill the famous ‘Custer Wolf.’ East of Trinidad, Colorado, ran a renegade wolf called ‘Old Three Toes’, the last of 32 wolves killed in Butler Pasture. This lonely wolf befriended a rancher’s collie, who was penned into a chicken run to keep him away from the wolf. One night they found freedom together by digging from opposite sides of the fence. The collie never returned home, and was killed weeks later by a poison bait. Old Three Toes and her litter of Gray Wolf-collie whelps were discovered shortly thereafter and all were killed.”

temporary autonomous zones

temporary autonomous zones

The counter-culture has specialised in using technology to create temporary autonomous zones: spontaneous and temporary com­munities, in part a response to the failure of geographically fixed centres of exploration and resistance.

From free festivals, protests, direct actions and be-ins to their modern incarnations; modern mutations have included raves and burning man. Burning man is an entire temporary city existing only for a week that conjures up an airport, radio stations and satellite uplinks, all of which get dismantled at the end leaving nothing but the flattest stretch of desert in the USA. Burning man continues the tradition of questioning ideas of value and exchange, nothing is for sale, there is no advertising and you are invited to participate not spectate.

The long tradition of environmental protest and direct action since the 1960’s has resulted in all kinds of temporary communites. Greenpeace ships, British all-women CND camps outside the Greenham Common USAF cruise missile base, anti-road protes­tors living in trees, the spontaneous concentrations of dissent surrounding the WTO and G8 summits.

[adapt]

The Haight Ashbury scene was effectively buried under the weight of a spontaneous semi-premanent migra­tion provoked by mainstream media attention.

Clubs like UFO in London [set up in part to fund the underground press] live short intense lives defining a moment and a scene before dying under the weight of all the media attention they generate.

The counter-culture’s focus on temporary autonomous zones is in part a collective realisation that concentrations of original, good or useful energy can be made more resilient by keeping them mobile, spontaneous and temprorary.

insurrection has festive aspects

‘Participants in insurrection invariably note its festive aspects, even in the midst of armed struggle, danger, and risk.’

Meanwhile, however, we turn to the history of classical anarchism in the light of the TAZ [Temporary Autonomous Zone] concept.

Before the “closure of the map,” a good deal of anti- authoritarian energy went into “escapist” communes such as Modern Times, the various Phalansteries, and so on. Interestingly, some of them were not intended to last “forever,” but only as long as the project proved fulfilling. By Socialist/Utopian standards these experiments were “failures,” and therefore we know little about them.

When escape beyond the frontier proved impossible, the era of revolutionary urban Communes began in Europe. The Communes of Paris, Lyons and Marseilles did not survive long enough to take on any characteristics of permanence, and one wonders if they were meant to. From our point of view the chief matter of fascination is the spirit of the Communes. During and after these years anarchists took up the practice of revolutionary nomadism, drifting from uprising to uprising, looking to keep alive in themselves the intensity of spirit they experienced in the moment of insurrection.

Sort of a spiritual hedonism, an actual Path of Pleasure, vision of a good life which is both noble and possible, rooted in a sense of the magnificent over-abundance of reality.” Hakim Bey

“from among the experiments of the inter-War period I’ll concentrate instead on the madcap Republic of Fiume, which is much less well known, and was not meant to endure.

Gabriele D’Annunzio, Decadent poet, artist, musician, aesthete, womanizer, pioneer daredevil aeronautist, black magician, genius and cad, emerged from World War I as a hero with a small army at his beck and command: the “Arditi.”

At a loss for adventure, he decided to capture the city of Fiume from Yugoslavia and give it to Italy. After a necromantic ceremony with his mistress in a cemetery in Venice he set out to conquer Fiume, and succeeded without any trouble to speak of.

But Italy turned down his generous offer; the Prime Minister called him a fool. In a huff, D’Annunzio decided to declare independence and see how long he could get away with it. He and one of his anarchist friends wrote the Constitution, which declared music to be the central principle of the State . The Navy (made up of deserters and Milanese anarchist maritime unionists) named themselves the Uscochi , after the long- vanished s who once lived on local offshore islands and preyed on Venetian and Ottoman shipping.

The modern Uscochi succeeded in some wild coups: several rich Italian merchant vessels suddenly gave the Republic a future: money in the coffers!

Artists, bohemians, adventurers, anarchists (D’Annunzio corresponded with Malatesta), fugitives and Stateless refugees, homosexuals, military dandies (the uniform was black with pirate skull-&-crossbones later stolen by the SS), and crank reformers of every stripe (including Buddhists, Theosophists and Vedantists) began to show up at Fiume in droves.

The party never stopped.

Every morning D’Annunzio read poetry and manifestos from his balcony; every evening a concert, then fireworks. This made up the entire activity of the government.

Eighteen months later, when the wine and money had run out and the Italian fleet finally showed up and lobbed a few shells at the Municipal Palace, no one had the energy to resist.”

Hakim Bey

festivities often border on insurrection

[degenerates can get you in and degenerates can get you out]

Burning Man is a huge, week long, annual, temporary autono­mous zone. 30,000 people turn up in the middle of the nevada desert and build a city from scratch. The city has an airport [built that week], more radio stations than London, is focused on, and full of, temporary art objects (full-size submarines surfacing out of the desert, vast disfunctional satellite dishes and ramps for launching corpses into orbit). The whole thing is clothing optional, and fuelled on good energy, every conceivable kind of dance music, yoga and some drugs.

Nothing gets sold at burning man. You can actually buy carrot juice but you have to barter for everything else. There are no adverts, no sponsorship and no logos.

It always looks like it won’t happen again but it keeps happening.

In 1999 someone did a perfect swan dive off a 100 ft tower into the desert floor.

Met a bunch of internet billionaires at burning man. One fellow I spoke to had just floated on NASDAQ and had his share in his company valued at $100 million. He was dispensing free entheo­gens.

The rules break down at burning man, the energy is positive and the people are good. It’s self governing and has it’s own police force [black rock rangers] who keep people from jumping into fires and tell you where you can park.

People ride around the desert on motorised sofas and make smudged art with their genitals

the free festivals

The free festival at the farm in 1978 happened when a convoy had left Stonehenge after the solstice to go to another free festival we were planning. It was the early days of making the vision of festivals being a summer-long nomadic culture real. We’d identified a field at Cinnamon Lane in Glastonbury as the site – there had been a small alternative culture settlement there for a number of years, caravans and a tipi. I’d lived there myself. But when we turned up the farmers and police knew about it and had blocked off the access. The police radio’d around and eventually came up with the venue of Worthy Farm, so we all headed there under police direction. I remember seeing Andrew Kerr there, and him saying ‘This is better than ‘71’. I think it was this free festival that rekindled Michael’s interest in holding another festival, the ‘79 Year of the Child one. Actually it was Rebecca, Michael’s daughter, and Andrew Kerr – it was their interest that was rekindled.

[...]

Yet in the earlier days of Stonehenge relations with the authorities could be less confrontational. Police used their car headlights to illuminate the stage when the power failed one year, while during the long hot summer of 1976 the fire brigade sprayed water for the hippies to dance and play in around the stones

convergence

Glastonbury happens in the summer in the middle of Wiltshire in England. It’s more music orientated than Burning man and it rains more often. The principal is the same, normal rules are suspended for the week with the mass of people turning up for the weekend.

Glastonbury attracts all kinds of people, hippies, ravers, travellers, anarchists, miscellaneous alternative types and people who just sneak off from jobs and from school.

People dance all night, some get naked, some take drugs, much temporary art and social interaction, everyone lives in temporary camps although with not so much radical emphasis on there con­struction as the theme camps at burning man.

During the course of both conferences rules get suspended and stuff happens. The law enforcement and Cracking communities interact in an atmosphere that hints at a temporary cessation of hostilities.

People hack and crack and tell others how to do the same. They give lectures on how to pick locks and steal time from phone companies.

the point at which you hit the highway on the way out.

‘At Glastonbury one year, after a week inside, I remember hiking out early to the perimeter through all the madness and reach­ing the outside. I remember being shocked by the clean, sterile tarmac after all the mud. There were police there and blue lights silently flashing, and police radios. The officers looked clean cut and stern and slightly concerned in an outside sort of way. Like border guards or worried fathers. It was like leaving a country, stepping out into something less.

Leaving Burning Man one year I remember when we finally got clear of the dust thrown up by the desert and onto a proper road. I was OK until we stopped at a roadside restaurant and I walked in barefoot wearing a sarong. Realised I was on the outside and felt very sad.

Driving back from burning man to san francisco a girl hunched low on a very fast, dusty, and too big for her motorbike shot past at incredible high speed. The hair on the back of my neck stood up. I realised the burning man population was abruptly splitting up, dispersed in all directions. Temporary convergence over with. People charged with new energy, moving outwards.

Positive subversive spirit intact and spreading.

You come out different.’

some existentialists are not plant people.

I am afraid of cities. But you mustn’t leave them. If you go too far you come up against the vegetation belt. vegetation has crawled for miles towards the cities. It is waiting. Once the city is dead, the vegetation will cover it, will climb over the stones, grip them, search them, make them burst with its long black pincers; it will blind the holes and let its green paws hang over everything.

protest

[zapatistas, WTO/G8, IMC]

wto

International protest focused on the physical, symbolic and elec­tronic manifestations of WTO and G8 summits can be traced back to the zapatista observation that the globalisation of corporate capitalism needed to be matched by a globalisation of resistance. This would involve a broad based coalition targeting the manifes­tations of this globalisation.

WTO protestors from Seattle to Genoa, exhibit a high level of decentralised and despatialised organisation. But the results of this organisation are a highly focused convergence by protestors (from all over the world and from a whole range of different inter­est groups) on the physical and temporal locations of WTO related meetings wherever in the world they are held.

how was the w.t.o. protest in seattle organised?

The internet, toilet walls, flyers, Word Of Mouth – communication channels existed which were discrete, cheap and fast enough to facilitate and motivate massive spontaneous disorganised coop­eration between disparate groups with common interest.

Since Seattle an international decentralised networked communi­cations infrastructure (mostly internet based) has been set up to bypass the traditional media and report events from the protestors point of view.

Indymedia, a fully fledged syndicated news network, takes cam­corder footage, first hand accounts and interviews and distributes them through a network of international websites.

Often this news channel is the common thread the holds the coalition together and despite not being a faction themselves they are often described as such by the traditional media; by the act of reporting they (de facto) direct the protests. The Italian police at the Genoa protests broke in, smashed computers, stole tapes and discs, then lined people in a building across the road up against a wall and beat them unconscious.

A key problem with the evolving hydra-headed protest movement is differentiating peaceful from violent protest, agent provocateurs from genuine protestors, and violence directed towards symbolic targets from general looting. This was less problematic when the movement was starting out, but it has grown and attracted increasingly opportunistic and unsympathetic elements and it’s tactics and strategy have been scrutinised.

..It would be interesting if different groups of protestors (within the larger coalition) were better able to identify and demarcate them­selves spatially at demonstrations.

..so that some differentiation in the style of protest among a wide range of participating groups was visible to outside observers who usually come away with only the images of the most violent and aggressive demonstrators in their heads ..and the implied infer­ence that these images are representative of all the demonstra­tors.

The media (even the independent media) has insufficient tools for effectively representing or mapping the experience of the differ­ent parts of the whole rather than the most visually or viscerally arresting.

If a section of the demonstrators normally associated with peace­ful protest are demarcated and still become engaged in clashes with riot police, and come away covered in blood the message is a different one to ‘protestors clash with riot police’

Peaceful demonstrators are often there, and in the majority, and are not heard or represented properly. Police brutality, unsympathetic violent elements and agent provocateurs are a documented reality and it may take some technological skill to differentiate the voices of non-violent protestors and convey their experiences. Violent protest directed at property may have its place but when it repeatedly fails to clearly hit its target and drowns out significant attempts at non-violent protest, the media (tradi­tional and non-traditional) and the protestors should be working to find ways of differentiating the two voices.

AN INSURGENCY BECOMES A NETWAR

On New Year’s Day 1994, some two to four thousand insurgents of the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) occupied six towns in Chiapas, declared war on the Mexican government, proclaimed radical demands, and mounted a global media campaign for support and sympathy. Through its star-quality spokesman “Subcomandante Marcos,” the EZLN broadcast its declarations…

[...]

The Mexican government’s initial reaction was quite traditional. It ordered army and police forces to suppress the insurrection, and downplayed its size, scope, and sources, in keeping with official denials in 1993 that guerrillas existed in Chiapas.

[...]

…it [EZLN] called a press conference and issued communiques to disavow Marxist or other standard ideological leanings. It denied all ties to Central American revolutionaries. It clarified that its roots were indigenous to Mexico, and its demands were national as well as local in scope. It appealed for nation-wide support for its agenda – which included respect for indigenous peoples; a true political democracy, to be achieved through the resignation of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the installation of a multi-party transition government, and legitimate and fair elections; and the enactment of social and economic reforms, including repeal of revisions in 1992 to Article 27 of the Constitution governing land tenure, and, by implication, the reversal of NAFTA. In addition, the EZLN called on civil society to engage in a nationwide struggle for social, economic, and political reforms, but not necessarily by taking up arms. The insurgents denied that they had a utopian blueprint, or had figured out exactly how to resolve Mexico’s problems. They also soon denied that the EZLN itself aimed to seize power. Finally, they called on international organizations (notably, the Red Cross) and civil-society actors (notably, human-rights groups) from around the world to come to Chiapas to monitor the conflict..

[...]

This active response by a multitude of NGOs to a distant upheaval – the first major case anywhere – was no anomaly. It built on decades of organizational and technological groundwork, and shows how the global information revolution is affecting the nature of social conflict. The NGOs formed into vast, highly networked, transnational coalitions to wage an information-age netwar to constrain the Mexican government and support the EZLN’s cause. The Zapatistas are insurgents. But the widespread argument that they are the world’s first post-Communist, postmodern insurgents makes a point that misses a point: Their insurgency is novel; but the dynamics that make it novel – notably, the links to transnational and local NGOs that claim to represent civil society – move the topic out of a classic “insurgency” framework and into an information-age “netwar” framework. Without the influx of NGO activists, starting hours after the insurrection began, the dynamics in Chiapas would probably have deteriorated into a conventional insurgency and counterinsurgency – and the small, poorly equipped EZLN might not have done well. Transnational NGO activism attuned to the information age, not the EZLN insurgency per se, is what changed the framework – but it took Marcos’ sense of strategy to make the change work.

Dealing with civil-society NGOs – whether as allies, as in humanitarian and disaster relief operations, or as antagonists, as in some cases of pro-democracy, human-rights, and environmental movements – is a new frontier for government officials around the world.

IMPLICATIONS BEYOND MEXICO

This case indicates that social netwar can be waged effectively where a society is open, or slowly beginning to open up; where divisive social issues are on people’s minds; and where outside activist NGOs and their networks have local counterparts with which to link. Such a society should be in a region where the activists have a well-developed communications infrastructure at their disposal for purposes of rapid consultation and mobilization. Because of such conditions, Mexico provides a much more susceptible environment for social netwar than do more closed societies (e.g., Burma, Cuba, and Iran) that are not yet fully connected to the Internet.

rug mobs

..three years later and NYC is seeing mysterious groups of citi­zens (with no prior knowledge of one another) coordi­nating nefarious spontaneous rug ‘not buying’ (with 10 minutes from assemblage to dispersal). They turn up at a predefined rug (creating an impromptu crowd) decide not to buy it and leave (with noth­ing taken or damaged).

It seems that spontaneous technologically medi­ated group coordination is an established (mostly understood) and widely employable tactic. For good and bad ..and good against bad ..and bad against good ..and for no particular reason or end.

getting back down

“Nigredo is about coming down. And to come down, all the way down, takes some time. You cannot do it overnight, and you cannot do it by getting high. Nor, as the wise maintain, can you do it by reading or thinking. Body and mind must come to rest.

If you do not know the ground state intimately, how will you be able to separate the signal from the noise, during the phase of amplification.”

castenada

The book ‘The teachings of Don Juan : A Yaqui Way of Knowl­edge’ by Carlos Castenada functions in part as an argument for drugs waking you up and mediating a new way of seeing the space.

Published in 1968, the book is an account of how Don Juan, a Yaqui indian shaman, teaches Castenada the use of various drugs in a spiritual context. It focuses on accounts of these drug experiences.

In his later books Castaneda states that his drug experiences were in fact a low order appreciation of what Don Juan was trying to teach him. Don Juan had been reluctant to indulge what was in fact Castenada’s own interest in drugs, he was teaching Cas­tenada to see differently, but to see in a way that did not funda­mentally require the use of drugs.

drugs and the built environment

You may not be awake to your patterns

You may not be receptive to change or able to see that there are other patterns

Disruption, trauma and shock can open you and shake you out of your patterns, but they are not useful patterns in themselves

among people who have experimented with psychedelic drugs, the richest experiences are often not the drug experiences but the life they learned to live if they found a way back afterwards.

The new patterns they chose subsequently were more consciously chosen and less arbitrary

The question is, can you be awake, having never taken drugs, having never been to war, having never travelled, having never had your assumptions challenged.

(Some people can and some people can’t).

Acid breaks down the arbitrary stuck structural symbolism of your banal built environment

One of the functions of hallucinogenic drugs in rights of passage rituals was to show the arbitrary nature of the built and social fabric of the tribe.

People and things that are familiar, that you take for granted, through tripping become strange again. The natural [non-urban, unfamiliar] environment, which often through social conditioning becomes irrelevant and is set in opposition to the [familiar] built environment, can suddenly make more sense than the built environment [which, by comparison, can seem arbitrary and alien].

Growing up in a huge urban environment like London or New York, people can come to believe that the shape of their world is fixed and can be no other way.

The very way of doing things they are exposed to, from social patterns and constructs to architecture (literally the shape of the buildings and the fact that these buildings are there). These structures have effectively always been there and will always be, permanent and unchallengeable.

Institutions, from the banks, the schools, the shopping malls,

 

the police and the other symbols of structure and power, to the mundane and banal buildings they see around them, all project an image of permanence and stability.

Even their own internal patterns fall into this category.

Taking acid can break down the arbitrary imposed part of your belief systems, destroying the faith that what you have known is all there is, that there can be nothing else because you know nothing else.

There are less (or more) violent ways to achieve the same effect.

Travelling exposes you to different assumptions and different structures that challenge those you have grown up with.

going to America from the europe you notice how everything is the same and yet different.

The scale is wrong, there are still street lamps but they look different, the mailboxes are different, the light switches, locks and taps follow different conventions.

All these things gnaw at you quietly and force you to think about the authority of your own country’s vision in the presence of an alternative.

History, art and anthropology are soft forms [compared to, and not combined with, drugs and travel] which often fail to challenge because they are easy to bring your old assumptions to.

War is a hard form. It can destroy your built environment, disrupt routine and social structure, and fundamentally challenge assumptions about truth and dominance. War is traditionally a time when assumptions are challenged and new methods and patterns are let loose.

Anything which breaks down individual dependence on an imposed vision can free your mind, allowing you to think differently and outside convention.

A primary challenge acid lays down is:

This is a different way of looking at your world, much of what you believed was constant is variable.

Can you internalise this, can you take these new eyes into your normal life and see and think differently without acid? Given this violent disruption to your internal world can you find structures that make sense and are consistent in the shadow of a new perspective?

Acid is often viewed as a shortcut to a higher state of consciousness, a state which ascetics and holy men can struggle to attain throughout there lives.

A violent, unpredictable and dangerous shortcut.

The central question after you have taken this shortcut and been given a glimpse of how your mind might see, is can you get back to that state clean (without drugs)?

If someone asks whether they should take acid [a more serious decision than mushrooms for example - mushrooms are not trivial but they don’t fry you in quite the same way], a flawed but sort of relevant analogy is:

‘This man breaks his back and after surgery he gets to the point where he’s able to do pretty much everything he could do before. You meet him later in life, you talk to him and it turns out he has learned a great deal from his experience and that he has met people and had adventures that he would not have had his life not been violently changed. But he broke his back, his life is not as it would have been had he not, he cannot go back.’

‘There is risk and a cost associated with harder drugs, and some people should not or need not ask to be opened up.’

‘drugs may show you the way but they don’t take you there for long’

One of the beautiful things in the world is a dope fiend getting straight. They have a special radiance.

Love, a relationship, a good job, friends, all those things we call “merit” or “good karma,” are part of your medicine, part of your power. You are going to need them all, but you are going to need more.

“It is hard to know that this magic carpet exists and that one will no longer fly on it”

-Jean Cocteau

The poison doctor calls upon all of his medicines and uses poisons to fight poisons. Here we part company with Twelve Step approaches. Nothing against abstinence; “whatever works,” we say. But most poisoners would prefer to give up the identity of “being an addict” without taking on the new one of “being in recovery.” We wish to maintain and continue the recovery that led us to poisons in the first place.

[...]

You may need to change your environment. If all of your friends are Junkies you have to move. A few members of our beloved poison clan have proved exceptions to this rule, but how many of us can pull off what the magicians do? Your ally will tell you.

Having kicked one addiction does not make you immune. In fact, if you fall again you will be worse off than before. Every magician can survive one bottoming out, by definition. Don’t tempt the Fates.

“A man who, after having long been in the power of opium or hashish, has succeeded, despite his enfeeblement by the habit

 

of slavery, in mustering the necessary energy for his deliverance, seems to me like an escaped prisoner. He inspires me with more admiration than the prudent man who has never lapsed, having always been careful to avoid temptation.”

“That ugly crumpled upper surface of yours, that cerebral cortex, is almost nonexistent in lower animals, but once you got the hang of evolutionary growth and a taste of the inflated abstract thoughts you could make with that cortex, you enlarged it and enlarged it until it became eighty percent of your volume. Then you started cranking out rarefied ideas as fast as you could crank them, and issuing commands to helpless appendages like me, forcing us to act on those ideas, to give them form. Out of that came civilization. You willed it into being because, with your cortex so oversized and all, you lost your common ground with other animals, and especially with plants; lost contact, became alienated and ordered civilization built in compensation. And there was nothing the rest of us could do about it. You were holed up there in your solid bone fortress, a cerebrospinal moat around you, using up twenty percent of the body’s oxygen supply and hogging a disproportionate share of nutrients, you greedy bastard; you had hold of the muscle motor switches and there was no way any of us could get at you and stop you from spoiling the delight of the world.” (_Even Cowgirls Get The Blues_)

The above conversation took place between the thumb and brain in _Even Cowgirls Get The Blues_, and gives the reader a good idea of what I am referring to in this section. The cerebrum and cerebral cortex are what separates us from the rest of life on earth, and rules almost all we see. The brain stem, however, has remained unchanged throughout time, and is perhaps our only link to our environment.

How can you tell if you are lucky? In his letter to the Romans, Paul is clear that he has two teachings, that there is an exoteric path and that there is an esoteric path. He states unambiguously that he knows that all substances are by nature pure, that Jesus told him so. The issue then is stumbling. Another’s stumbling. Another who does not understand that all substances are pure

With the very poison, a little of which would kill any other being, a man who understands poison would dispel another poison.

The Poison Path is the narrow way, the twisting path, or no path at all. You could make it, O Nobly Born, you just might survive, yes, but who could follow you? Better to send them down the big road, well trodden and paved; this Poison Path is no shortcut. The Poison Path is best suited to tricksters and magicians who, if the stories are to be believed, come back to life after getting killed.

If you don’t feel like a normal person until you snort H this is a sign that – well, a bad sign. A sign that you must avoid it, immediately; that the prognosis of your relationship with this particular ally is poor.

dissent

Tom Frank, in his essay ‘Dark Age – why johnny can’t dissent’, attacks the ineffectiveness of a compromised counterculture which failed to evolve from it’s roots in the 1950’s and 60’s.

tom frank

“It was indeed the age of of information, but information was not the precursor to knowledge, it was the tool of salesmen”

“where citizens are referred to as consumers”

“The American economy may be undergoing the most dramatic shifts in this century, but for the past thirty years people in music, art, and culture generally have had a fixed, precise notion of whats wrong with American life and the ways in which the responsible powers are to be confronted. It is a preconception shared by almost every magazine, newspaper, TV host, and rock star across the alternative spectrum. And it is the obselesence and exhaustion of this idea of cultural dissent that accounts for our singular inability to confront the mind-boggling dangers of the information age.”

“The ways in which this system is to be resisted are equally well understood and agreed upon.The establishment demands homgeneity; we revolt by embracing diverse, individual lifestyles.

chemical anchors

“note that the audience’s untilled, emotional farmland is a single-use commodity that will be recapitalized by many industries external to the “music” industry

imprinting certain songs on the brains of a teenage audience during their formative years serves as a selection mechanism for future radio stations, commercials, period movies, etc

the period of harvesting the fruit of these early seeds is when the onetime teenagers reach their early-thirties – old enough to have earning power, young enough to have disposable income (low chance of mortgages, kids, etc).

the teenagers’ attention should be treated as part of a transaction … companies that engage said attention are benefiting from a (re)transmission medium for which they are never billed … and can never be reused … formative memories (imprinted on virgin minds) are never lost or less intense than their successors.

songs are like links in blogs … molecules that anchor chemical reactions, given appropriate catalysis … they are chrono-emotio-spatial hash signatures by virtue of early binding to formative experiences

the limited resource, the economic resource is not the songs … it’s the formative experiences … which are being sold in an invisible transaction that commits the memory’s owner to a lifetime of subsequent heartstring-pulling … unpaid and involuntary.

the music industry can and does make money by selling performance rights to these songs, into infinity … even if _all_ the songs were given away for free on P2P networks … they are an anonymous sorting mechanism … the only problem is the 17-year gap between binding the song to a memory and harvesting the disposable income of the memory’s owner.” Rich Persaud

seeming vs being

Broadly speaking, ideas can evolve to seem true or they can evolve to be true

“For the magicians not only believed in marvels but audaciously sought to work them: by their straining after the exceptional, the natural philosopher who followed them were first given a clue to the regular.”

“The dream gives direction to human activity and both expresses the inner urge of the organism and conjures up appropriate goals.”

“Everywhere the dross of fraud and charlatanism mingled with the occasional grains of scientific knowledge that magic utilised or produced.”

“If gold did not come out of lead in the experiments of the alchemists, they are not to be reproached for their ineptitude but congratulated on their audacity: their imaginations sniffed quarry in a cave they could not penetrate, and their baying and pointing finally called the hunters to the spot.”

“..to have dreamed so riotously was to make the technics that followed less incredible.”

But for all its color, Khaosan Road [epicentre and crossroads for backpacking world travellers] is more than a curiosity. It is a raucous, round-the-clock wake for a way of life that is gone forever. It is the black hole at the center of a shrinking world where the Age of Discovery has ended, all roads have been traveled and the words “remote” and “exotic” have all but lost their meaning.””The travelers have changed as well; indeed, the whole enterprise of rough travel has changed. In many ways, it has become as regimented as a standard package tour.””The sandals, the strange hair and the tie-dyed shirt are no longer a cry of rebellion, as they were in the 1960’s and 70’s. They are now the gray-flannel suit of the budget traveler, following in 30-year-old footsteps in search of enlightenment: eating the same food, listening to the same music, making the same discoveries.””The T-shirts display the grip of conformity from one generation to the next: familiar portraits of Che Guevara, John Lennon, Bob Marley, Mao Zedong, Kurt Cobain and an American Indian chief.””Young Moses Fletcher, 23, from Britain looks exactly like mature Wolfgang Maria Ohlheuser, 60, from Germany, with their loose white cotton outfits, beards and sandals, except that Mr. Ohlheuser’s beard is white.””And what is there left for these travelers to discover? The recipe for adventure can now be found in a guidebook, like the ingredients for a chocolate cake – every dirt trail, every hill-tribe village, every night market, every guest house, every glorious sunrise.””The world of travel has been tamed. The last few rough patches in Asia are being nibbled away now: the northern edges of Laos, the plains of southwestern China, the hidden villages of northern Myanmar.””Even the remotest of these have been mapped, analyzed and assessed for their curiosity quotient in the guidebooks.”

“And his tale at the beginning was like the hashish that makes people happy when awake; then it became like the hashish of a dreamer.

His words were at first as sweet as honey, his voice penetrating the multitude as the first rain of summer parched earth. From his tongue there went forth a perfume more exquisite than must or incense: his head shone like a light, the only luminary in a black night. And his tale at the beginning was like the hashish that makes people happy when awake; then it became like the hashish of a dreamer. Toward morning he raised his voice, however, and his words swelled like the rising Nile in the hearts of the people: they were for some as pacifying as the entrance into Paradise, but as frightening for others as the Angel of Death. Joy filled the spirits of some, horror the hearts of others. And the closer the moment of dawn, the more powerful became his voice, the louder it’s reverberations within the people, until the hearts of the multitude reared against each other as in a battle; stormed against each other like the clouds in the heavens of a tempestuous night. Lightening blots of anger and thunderclaps of wrath collided.

But when the sun rose and the tale of Far-li-mas closed, unspeakable astonishment filled the confused minds of all; for when those who remained alive looked about them their glances fell upon the priests – and the priests lay dead upon the ground.”

Kash legend fragment from The Masks of God, Joseph Campbell

a new form of difference

…but a new form of difference and dissent is emerging, A couple of examples would be the Open Source movement and the IMC (Independent Media Collective). The premise for this new form of dissent is constructive rather than oppositional, it is about building rather than stance.

In collectively developing Linux, the Open Source community have built an operating system which rivals Microsoft Windows,

 

and Windows is a product that has made Microsoft the most suc­cessful commercial organisation on the planet.

The IMC has created a world wide news network. Ordinary people can bypass or supplement the mainstream media, and, where they are involved in events, contribute what they have seen and heard.

Both Linux and the IMC are examples of new forms of collectively constructive community made possible by computer networks. Both have relatively flat, contribution and merit based hierarchies.

Computer networks allow opposition to organise, but more inter­estingly they make possible new forms of autonomous community and collective construction.

Location aware devices and the ability to mark and annotate real spaces will dramatically extend the possibilities for collective construction.

Dissent is really the wrong word. Building is a better one.

The accelerating spread of wireless network nodes, the informal coordination of community networks by groups like Consume in the UK and NoCat in California and the higher level self organis­ing of those groups through organisations like freenetworks.org. The realisation that wireless network nodes can broadcast loca­tion information [as an RDF feed for example]. The onset of next generation cell phone networks with advanced positional func­tionality and chip level GPS being built into phones, handhelds, laptops and wearable. The combination of proximity awareness, live, social, peer to peer wireless connectivity, and GPS. That is the geomesh we are building around ourselves. Means that a spontaneous bottom up (rather than top down) heterarchical, network organisation will soon be the easiest social structure to configure and apply effectively to almost any given problem.

It’s not a question of the edges or something to oppose its a question of conditions and structure and allowing them to change consensually and constructively

Extra-geographical states based on common interest, with their own constitutions, currency, taxation, banks etc. Communities able to collectively reinterpret the real physical world around them. Marking, demarcating and annotating real space using networks they will live in a world of agreed upon and engineered meaning that people outside the community will not see.

Real world problems, theory from architecture, from simulation, from linguistics, anthropology and psychology, ideas from science fiction, literature and mythology, all offer countless new ways to think about how this technology might evolve.

Cell phones become internet enabled and location aware, every­thing in the real world gets tracked, barcoded and mapped.

Overlaying everything is a whole new invisible mesh of textual, visual and audible information. This information becomes avail­able as you get close or when you ask.

availability

Consumer orientated, mobile, peer to peer and internet connected devices which are location aware (that is capable of determining and transmiting there current geographical location) or easilly con­nected to something that is are becoming available, the software to connect them up in interesting ways is already available.

There is pressure from the people and corporations and gov­ernment; each wanting to move this stuff forward for there own multifarious reasons (social networking, cash, E911).

geography as context and constraint

Since the internet began its exponential growth, it has been easier for ordinary people to ignore geography as a constraint, commu­nicating, organising and coordinating actions across borders and boundaries both artificial and real, using ideas and common inter­est rather than proximity as an organising principle.

cell phones

The second notable explosive growth curve charts the adoption of cell phones.

Cell phones set you free in a different sense, they allow you to communicate from anywhere.

The integration of internet access (high bandwidth peer to peer wireless networking) as a basic component of cell phone function­ality, together with location awareness (the cell phone knows it’s geographical location or what it’s close to) is leading somewhere.

The step beyond ideal, but dislocated, communities, is adding this geographical layer to the mobile internet. A spatially aware network, whether accurate (longitude and latitude) or informal (a rough indicator of proximity), means that proximity could again become a pervasive, useful but not constraining, utilitarian factor in organising community or in a searching for information.

geography has not mattered

geography is unimportant on two counts.

i. It doesn’t matter where you are – because the internet makes distance irrelevant in the context of communication or information retrieval.

ii. It doesn’t matter where you are – because you can access the internet from wherever you are.

geography doesnt matter

“It has become clear that, thanks to the internet, geography matters less and less” Wired Magazine – March 2000

i need a sandwich

but if you are moving and have a device that is location aware and connected to the internet..

 

Geography is an essential added filter

it provides a context for your needs

neo: I need a sandwich, I’m not prepared to walk more than a 200 metres

operator: knock on the door of number 17 and mrs jones will make you a sandwich if you do the washing up

mass market wearable hardware

The e911 requirements called for a new generation of location aware wireless devices.

The hardware aspects of this technological revolution have been available to the military, to large businesses and the scientific community for some time.

The technology, and the geographical state of mind, has now filtered down from the yachting community and more recently from backpack­ers and car owners.

A GPS is now a chip level commodity item (you can add it to anything). Powerful wireless network cards are commodity item. Handheld computers and over specified cell phones are commodity items.

It is already possible to annotate space.

a). work out where you are, find the coordinates (GPS or a web based address to coordinate converter)

b). write a note, include the location

c). publish an RSS place feed

You become a part of a distributed place database that is already growing rapidly and being mined.

Leave a note at that geographical location.

It’s not that hard and it’s getting easier.

by adding geographical awareness to the internet you create something new

…this is the last place I saw my father before he died.

The concept is an extension of a cartesian system and yet the point in space specified may link to an emotional state rather than a cold label.

You could search for sadness in New York.

The whole world will become an annotated space, which links from the real to the information space and back again. The world as interface.

You can search locally based on your current position,

e.g. show all the restaurants within a mile radius.

The device knows where you are and the database knows what’s close by.

peer to peer is more interesting than broadcast models

It is already possible to broadcast information, for example the location of the nearest Starbucks, but life becomes more interest­ing when consumers can contribute information.

..show me all the restaurants my friends like within a mile radius.

The structure becomes interesting when ordinary users can anno­tate that database.

At that point the database grows and the users direct its uses, they determine the future business models for such an infrastruc­ture.

You are driving down the main street of an unfamiliar town and all you can see is the shops and buildings on either side. You are effectively in a valley and all your information about the place is constrained by line of sight.

The map on the display of your mobile device however is lit up with dots which represent places of interest determined by the network Starbucks, McDonalds, 76 etc.

A more interesting case: the information you are receiving is not just a broadcast that lists the nearest Starbucks and McDonalds, but information based on your personal pro­file and the suggestions and opinions of your peers.

The places that you might be actually be inter­ested in that you can’t see are now visible and accessible to you.

Alternative bookshops, Yoga studios, old friends or whatever

Factor in everybody and their contributions and opinions, and you radically empower the system.

Conventionally in a city you would maybe know only a very few of your neighbours and mostly in the same street, your wider com­munity is present, but currently invisible and inaccessible.

Sitting at home bored, you check your device and it indicates that someone you haven’t met, but who has a friend in common, is sit­ting at home two streets across and three houses down and they are also bored.

Members of distributed communities held together by common interest could be made more aware of who within those communi­ties is physically local to them.

headgames

Assume kids have cell phones that transmit their geographical coordinates

Computer games evolve that actually get kids out of the house and running around instead of being stuck in front of a computer 93

 

screen.

Gaming stress tests technology and defines ways in which it can be used effectively (businesses for example will end up making use of the innovations that designers of these games instantiate).

‘go to the end of their road and climb onto the roof of the aban­doned cinema’ (or whatever; localization involves user contribu­tion)

..when the device transmits the coordinates of the top of the cinema the game gives them with the next problem… (add a time component: run to the end of the road and climb onto the roof of the deserted cinema)

Extending phone functionality:

status messages on phones

By the side of each of the names on your cell phone’s people list appears a status message: bored, busy, in transit etc.

Once people are logging their location in such a way that their friends can find them, you could be notified if your friends came within a mile radius of your current location

Parking space finding, homeless people are given free devices to log parking spaces as they become available (and receive pay­ment)

Entering a restaurant you see a huge burning skull in the middle of the room. Nobody else sees it. The skull was left at this geo­graphical location by one of your peer group indicating that the restaurant is terrible.

..a box in a room may have something in it even though it is empty.

society is actively looking for new ways to organise

Society is actively looking for new ways to organise, and ques­tioning ideas of value and exchange [inertia created by dominant power structures].

Location awareness offers a radical new way to organise and aug­ment communities.

a united states, freedom, representative democracy

There is an array of entirely new ways of doing things, and we’re just beginning to see that a lot of them can be linked together to make even newer ways of doing things.

The ideas behind the western representative democracies have not been allowed expression in terms of modern capabilities.

Those original ideas found expression in the structures that have come down to us, but those structures were defined in the context of the technological capabilities of the times.

Western representative democracies were fixed as a way of doing things at a point in time when reaching the place where discus­sions were held and decisions were made involved days or even weeks of travelling on horses. The only way to be represented was to send a representative.

Nobody seems to have noticed that conditions have changed, or at least they are unwilling to discuss reform.

the new economy

Things are still getting weirder.

The recent collapse of the new economy stocks, does not repre­sent the end of technological change.

The underlying value generated by the internet was not bound up in companies like amazon which hold up big signs that say ‘we are the internet’ (which they plainly are not) but in the broader effects on society and the economy of a wider range of com­munications technologies (the internet, email, web accessible databases, wireless communications) and wider access to, and applications of, those technologies.

The new economy fed off the experimentation of marginal com­munities (the military, academics, the open source community, the counter-culture and the porn industry) that were using the internet before the rest of the world got interested and who won’t stop working on what interests them because the stock market woke up to it’s own confusion.

From the point of view of the more interesting new economy experimentation, those years have been compared to the punk movement (in the sense that it gave people who would never otherwise have been in bands a chance to get up on stage and play ..however badly). The repercussions of punk are still being felt. The repercussions of the new economy with the subversive questions it raised (and to a large extent failed to answer) about how things could be done, who should have the power, what is valuable and where we should be going, are still to be determined.

The ongoing argument is a longer term one and it isn’t over. If nothing else the money didn’t all entirely disappear. Infrastructure, software and new ways of doing things are being absorbed by society and traditional industry.

..ten years ago no one had a cell phone, email or a web browser. You couldn’t find what you needed or talk to the people you wanted to talk to (and now you can), national boundaries were barriers to the flow of information.

..and the new stuff won’t go away just yet, because the money got spent, the infrastructure was bought and installed, and the system that allowed the whole thing to happen in the first place was designed to withstand a nuclear attack, a more serious threat than an economic slow down.

..if things can move just a little further ordinary people will find themselves with internet connected cell phones (high speed con­nections and fast processors) that know where they are.

Times have changed.

reinterpreting anarchy as a positive and constructive relative of heterarchy

Anarchy and heterarchy are potentially a state of grace rather than a grave synonym for destructive disorder.

Anarchy (the organisational idea rather than the usual associa­tions) has survived the 20th century in better shape than other ideological labels. Despite being branded with a raft of negative associations at the hands of centralising and controlling forces, and falling into the hands of the purely disruptive and destructive, anarchy (reinterpreted) potentially has something positive to say that new technological and social conditions finally make relevant.

A hybrid of heterarchy and anarchy could mean a network and infrastructure that would allow, integrated, but separate construc­tive communities to be autonomous, independent, interdependent, and free. A further iteration on the ideas of the founders of the united states for example.

Anarchy and heterarchy are brothers, and they do not, despite what you may have been told, necessarily mean you any harm. They can fix problems that other systems can only hide from.

prototyping future community

..follow the form of Dee Hock (the man behind Visa) and other radical but realistic thinkers, build a network of similarly motivated companies and financial services

make that network the corner stone of a community that will be able to keep it’s financial and non-financial transactions in line with a core of commonly held beliefs by keeping those transac­tions inside the community network.

This is an old idea, immigrant communities often semi-formalise the idea of keeping their dollars cir­culating inside their communities. Cooperative banks grew out of socialist ideas.

Make mobile and location aware devices an impor­tant part of your thinking.

[maybe find some next generation hardware and software, intended ultimately for general consumption, preferably at the point when it is being developed, tested and perfected and convince the developers to make your network its first customer].

Then conceive of this community in terms of a non-geographical state thats always locally aware, where membership gives you access not just to conventional services but also the rest of the community ..and the community infrastrucutre: experiment with new ideas of value and exchange, share houses, cars, food and ideas.

Potentially a digitally mediated 21st century extended commune

There are people who are quietly doing all this stuff.

..the same ideas could equally be employed by the Aryan nation.

better ways

Disenfranchised and alienated communities are suffering a huge and present hangover in the form of the blunt instruments of the 20th century. Money, mass production, centralisation, mass media focused on broadcasting rather than dialogue, government by force aligned to the threat of total war and nuclear annihilation, government sanctioned by a token vote every five years, govern­ment sustained by involuntary taxation.

 

It seems difficult to imagine these ideas being marginalised, but formerly dominant forces going much further back have been reduced to symbolic roles, displaced by new forms of social organisation rather than directly defeated.

Change for good is coming up with something better, not shouting abuse from the sidelines.

..its about plumbing, not revolution. Plumbing can be political, but its a largely inclusive form of politics.

Better means of exchange

Better community tools

Better interfaces to local spaces

revision note

..at the time of writing this partial revision of the original headmap manifesto there are an estimated 500,000 weblogs with Geourl place tags indicating their location. Thoughts implicitly associated with places

With the debates described, the issues looming, and the promises of digital composing practices that rely on pastiche, remix, and appropriation, we offer the following recommendations for technorhetoricians, new media writers and designers, teachers, and students who want to participate in copyright activism and the protection of Fair Use:
We must recognize and understand the ways that our work will move online, and we have to take an active role in articulating our needs and wants regarding our work—through an informed understanding of copyright, through Creative Commons sorts of licensures, and by other means.
We must give credit where credit is due, using whatever modes and tools are available within digital realms. Attribution is key to an ethics of Fair Use.
We have to recognize that there are implications for our actions in digital space, but at the same time we must be bold, experimental, creative, progressive, and generative.
We must educate members of our own communities of the dangers facing digital authorship. The labels assigned to us by mass media outlets—titles such as “thief” or “pirate”—harm the copyright activist movement. Our communities must understand the implications of legislation passed against our practices, and why the community of digital authors is necessary for artists as a whole.
We must engage ourselves in the legislative process—via elected officials, legal representation, community organizations—as an avenue of battling harmful legislation against creative remix and nuanced, appropriately complex and fair understandings of digital authorship.
We must foster open communities dedicated to the creative process. Our work is not separated from the communities that surround us; we must not separate ourselves from it either. Whether this support comes from engagement in creative processes and the delivery and distribution of digital work, or this support comes in the form of legislative activism, we must be prepared to act in solidarity against purely profit-driven forces that seek to stifle digital authors.
We must exercise our own creativity. Not only does this participation encourage the growth of the artistic ecosystem as a whole, but it allows us to fully understand the depth of the situations we must face and to appreciate the necessity of our practices.
We are not pirates; we are not thieves. We are a legitimate and necessary community dedicated to fostering creative processes and the rich, robust, global networks that facilitate, enrich, and provide an outlet for these very processes.
Implications of Digital Copyright Issues for Writing Classrooms
As writers and as writing teachers in this historical moment, we find ourselves negotiating the labyrinth of copyright law alongside students. The tenets, values, and beliefs we have discussed here outline areas for writing instructors to pay attention to as we address authoring; authorship; authorial rights; existing digital copyright law; and the rights, roles and responsibilities of authors and creators in digital spaces.
 
Folding digital constructs of authorship, copyright, and ethics into our writing curricula will require additional research and writing about these issues to teach—and do—digital composition in all of its complexity. We will need to consider and/or reconsider, for example, the types of tools we teach as we both teach and model responsible use of digital media. We will have to coordinate class time to teach students various software, hardware, and integration of digital media that will best situate them for responsible use of others’ creative work. Students’ digital compositions will be geared increasingly toward a much larger and more authentic audience as their work is stored or posted online as a Web site or to a filesharing space, and this in turn will require more than an awareness of digital copyright issues. Rather, digital media pieces published via public forums such as the Web will necessitate both a familiarity with copyright and attribution, but also deeper understandings of audience, context, purpose, delivery, and other variables that have certainly played a role in our writing classrooms, but which migrate and evolve in interesting ways in digital spaces.
 
We will and must continue to re-define what we think of and count as “original composition” and concentrate our attention more on the acts of connecting taking place between digital media pieces that have been strung together to best communicate a new argument. Although the debate surrounding digital copyright is tricky and indeed creates an ever-changing, convoluted labyrinth for teachers and students, the affordances digital media offer for innovation and creativity to any rhetorical situation seems worth the time educating ourselves and our students as to the changing ideas and practices surrounding authorship and attribution.",<em>MANIFESTO: Technorhetoricians and/as Copyright Activists</em>,,,,2014-08-05T16:46:57+00:00,3,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/3,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=54,54,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T14:27:18+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Digital Composition, Digital Humanities",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/54

The time has come to reject expensive consumer and prosumer software that hinders the extensibility of digital discourse and limits digital production literacy to programs and file formats that are destined for disruptive upgrades or obsolescence.

Digital scholars in the loosely defined fields of rhetoric and composition, computers and writing, and technical communication should create free and open source artifacts that are software- and device-independent. Discourse posted on the open Web can hardly be considered free if access requires costly software or particular devices.

Additionally, the literacies and language we develop through engaging in digital scholarship and knowledge-making should enable us to speak confidently, unambiguously, and critically with one another about the intricacies and methods of digital production.

And as teachers, we should actively work to provide students with sustainable, extensible production literacies through open, rhetorically grounded digital practices that emphasize the source in “free and open source.”

Defining Lo-fi Technologies

Lo-fi production technologies are stable and free. They consist of and/or can retrograde to:

Plain text files (.txt, .xml, .htm, .css, .js, etc.)
Plain text editors (Notepad, TextEdit, pico/nano, vi, etc.)
Standardized, human-readable forms of open languages expressed in plain text (XML, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)
Single-media files (image, audio, video) in open formats
Despite their humble, decades-old base technology (plain text), innovative uses of lo-fi technologies can be remarkably hi-fi, as in the case of AJAX (whose most famous application may be Google’s Gmail service).

Lo-fi is LOFI

“Lo-fi” describes a preferred set of production technologies that digital producers should strive to command, but as an acronym, LOFI outlines four principles of digital production that are essential for the advancement, extension, and long-term preservation of digital discourse:

Lossless: Discourse presented through lo-fi production technologies neither degrades nor becomes trapped in the production itself. Text migrates and transforms from a single source (e.g., XML, or an application of XML) to any number of other devices and artifacts; images, video, and other media elements maintain their integrity as individual files that are orchestrated with one another at a reader’s moment of access, not at the producer’s moment of File > Import or File > Save.
Open: Lo-fi artifacts’ source code and media elements are available for inspection, revision, and extension outside the scope of any one piece of production software and any one producer. Openness includes and encourages end-user/reader customization and repurposing.

Flexible: Discourse artfully and rhetorically created with lo-fi production technologies can be experienced unobtrusively in multiple ways by different users equipped with a wide variety of conventional, mobile, and adaptive devices—all from a single artifact. No plugins, special downloads, or device-/reader-specific artifacts are required.

In(ter)dependent: Lo-fi production technologies direct orchestration (like a recipe), not composition (like a TV dinner), allowing users and their devices full control to render (or not) and perhaps repurpose the media elements that constitute a digital artifact.
Manifesto

1. Software is a poor organizing principle for digital production.

2. Digital literacy should reach beyond the limitations of software.

3. Discourse should not be trapped by production technologies.

4. Accommodate and forgive the end user, not the producer.

5. If a hi-fi element is necessary, keep it dynamic and unobtrusive.

6. Insist on open standards and formats, and software that supports them.

Distance is a positive principle, not a deficit. Online can be the privileged mode.

The possibility of the ‘online version’ is overstated. The best online courses are born digital.

By redefining connection we find we can make eye contact online.

‘Best practice’ is a totalising term blind to context – there are many ways to get it right.

Every course design is philosophy and belief in action.

The aesthetics of online course design are too readily neglected: courses that are fair of (inter)face are better places to teach and learn in.

Online courses are prone to cultures of surveillance: our visibility to each other is a pedagogical and ethical issue.

Text is being toppled as the only mode that matters in academic writing.

Visual and hypertextual representations allow arguments to emerge, rather than be stated.

New forms of writing make assessors work harder: they remind us that assessment is an act of interpretation. 

Feedback can be digested, worked with, created from. In the absence of this, it is just ‘response’.

Assessment strategies can be designed to allow for the possibility of resistance.

A routine of plagiarism detection structures-in a relation of distrust.

Assessment is a creative crisis as much as it is a statement of knowledge.

Place is differently, not less, important online.

Closed online spaces limit the educational power of the network.

Online spaces can be permeable and flexible, letting networks and flows replace boundaries.

Course processes are held in a tension between randomness and intentionality.

Online teaching should not be downgraded into ‘facilitation’.

Community and contact drive good online learning.

Online learning is not the whipping boy of higher education. As a classroom teacher first and foremost, I have no interest in proselytizing for online learning, but to roundly condemn it is absurd. Online learning is too big and variable a target. It would be like roundly condemning the internet or all objects made from paper.

Much of the rhetoric currently being used against MOOCs is the same rhetoric that has been used against online learning since the 90s (and against distance education since the mid-1800s). There are important questions to be asked, such as how do MOOCs change the business models of higher education, or how do we maintain online the intimate and tailored experiences some of us create in the classroom, but these are not new questions. What I find exciting about the rise of the MOOC is that it brings with it a new level of investment in discussions of online learning. This isn’t to say that MOOCs are necessarily good or bad (they are, in fact, a lot of different things, depending on the MOOC), but to get lost entirely in the stories being told about MOOCs is to miss the forest for the trees, so to speak.

Since I started teaching in 1999, I’ve frequently encountered an anti-pedagogical bent amongst fellow teachers and faculty, a resistance to thinking critically about our teaching practices and philosophies, especially regarding online learning. What we need is to ignore the hype and misrepresentations (on both sides of the debate) and gather together more people willing to carefully reflect on how, where, and why we learn online. There is no productive place in this conversation for exclusivity or anti-intellectualism. Those of us talking about digital pedagogy and digital humanities need to be engaging thoughtfully in discussions about online learning and open education. Those of us in higher ed. need to be engaging thoughtfully with K-12 teachers and administrators. And it’s especially important that we open our discussions of the future of education to students, who should both participate in and help to build their own learning spaces. Pedagogy needs to be at the center of all these discussions.

I’ve said previously that “MOOCs are a red herring,” because there is a bigger beast in the offing. I would not proselytize for online learning or MOOCs, but I would for open education, participant pedagogy, critical voraciousness, and play. The internet didn’t invent collaboration or solve all the problems of institutional access, but it does allow for new forms of collaboration and does bring educational opportunities to new audiences. (In my own online classes, for example, I’ve taught housebound students, new mothers in rural areas hundreds of miles from a university, and soldiers stationed abroad.)

I have no interest in debating the whether of online learning. That bird has most assuredly flown. What I’d like to do here is outline a pedagogy of online learning – not best practices, but points of departure to encourage a diversity of pedagogies.

1. Online learning happens at many different scales. Not all online learning, though, is scalable. The MOOC is one possible approach, and it is neither a panacea nor a pariah. It might function well for certain learners or for certain courses, but it should be viewed as one of many available approaches. Online learning can happen alone or in groups of 2, 20, 500, or 100,000. The scale of the activity, event, or course changes the experience (but does not define the experience).

2. I’ve argued elsewhere that “all learning is necessarily hybrid.” The best online learning should engage us in an immediate and physical way. Learning shouldn’t happen entirely at a desk. The best online courses — the best courses of all types — ask students to do work in the world (outside their houses and/or outside the online course portal).

3. The openness of the internet is its most radical and pedagogically viable feature. This isn’t to say that every class should be entirely open, but we should not assume in advance (or use systems that assume) we need a learning space to be closed (or password-protected). Some learning happens best in rooms with walls, but some learning happens best in fields or in libraries or in town squares.

4. A class should not be made open purely as a publicity ploy (though publicity can be a happy consequence). We need to ask ourselves how openness serves the students (both the official for-credit students and the unofficial not-for-credit students). The mission of an educational institution is both to serve its students and also to serve a much broader public. Putting these two audiences into direct conversation is (in many cases) an effective pedagogical strategy.

5. Rigor fails to be rigorous when it’s made compulsory. It can’t be guaranteed in advance by design. Academic rigor shouldn’t be built into a course like an impenetrable fortress for students to inhabit. Rigor has to be fostered through genuine engagement.

6. Designing an online course involves building both the course and its interface. Online course development requires more preparation, more advance planning, and more technological support. At many institutions there’s a problematic divide between instructional designers and teachers – between those building online courses and those teaching them. Expert teachers need to build their own online courses or we need to create closer collaborative relationships between teachers and instructional designers.

7. Online learning is not the domain of for-profit institutions. While online learning has been most-visibly used by for-profits, this leaves no permanent black spot upon its hide. Innovative, pedagogically-sound, and ethical work is being done online. That is the work we need to be talking about and advancing with gusto.

8. Don’t wield outcomes like a weapon. Online learning activities should not be overly designed or too-strictly standardized. In “Explaining Rhizomatic Learning to My Five Year Old,” Dave Cormier writes, “We shouldn’t decide beforehand what we’re going to learn.” Improvisation, play, and experimentation are essential to learning.

9. FERPA is not an excuse for bad pedagogy. FERPA is designed to protect students and does not outlaw public work. Some simple guidelines: If you’re asking students to do public work online, let them know their work will be public, offer the option of anonymity, never post grades publicly, and don’t forget about intellectual property (which is separate from FERPA). 

10. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to online education. Learning is not neatly divisible into discrete chunks (like courses). We make courses, because they suit a business model and because they’re practical (i.e. gathering a community in the same place at the same time). The chunks, though, 10 weeks, 15 weeks, semesters, quarters, are arbitrary. The course is not always the best container for learning.

11. Community and dialogue shouldn’t be an accident or by-product of a course. They should be the course. You can’t just stick people into a room and expect them to talk. The same is true for online space. We must create platforms that both actively facilitate and passively encourage interaction. Then, we work to model constructive interaction. The best online courses have a personality, create genuine relationships, and ask hard intellectual questions.

12. Content-expertise does not equal good teaching. The internet already has lots of experts in all manner of things. A good pedagogue, rather, relies on a variable mixture of content-expertise and careful thinking about teaching practices. The teacher is not merely a facilitator, but uses her own learning of a subject (its histories, theories, and methodologies) to design, structure, and scaffold a learning experience. Once a course begins, the growing expertise of the students, and not the teacher, should be the primary focus.

13. Online learning needs less quantitative and more qualitative assessment. Students are not columns in a spreadsheet. Most learning management systems make assessment far too neat and tidy. Certainly, some things can be objectively assessed, but that’s not the stuff of learning that we should be focusing on so intently. Numerical data should be a guide only, a way into the deeper conversation about what was learned, a reference point for more productive and qualitative assessment. The most important form of assessment, though, is self-assessment by the students of their own learning.

The first mistake of many online classes and the majority of MOOCs (so far) is that they try to replicate something we do in face-to-face classes, mapping the (sometimes pedagogically-sound, sometimes bizarre) traditions of on-ground institutions onto digital space. Trying to make an online class function exactly like an on-ground class is a missed opportunity. There’s a lot that happens in F2F classrooms that just can’t be replicated in an online environment, and that’s okay. Better to ask ourselves what can be achieved online and what sorts of classes (or learning experiences) we can construct to leverage the potentials of the specific interface or community.",<em>Online Learning: A Manifesto</em>,,,,2014-08-05T17:45:27+00:00,6,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/6,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=59,59,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T14:24:56+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Digital Humanities, Online Teaching, Open Access",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/59

Bettina Lemm

This Manifesto considers Foucault’s “What is an author” and Kathleen Fitzpatrick’s lecture at Duke University in February of 2011 “The future of Authorship,” to establish the 10 commanding roles and responsibilities of the author in the Age of New Media.

1. The role of the author is to give validity to a text. Since the 18th century, we have trusted the legitimacy of a text by the “creative power” (Foucault 551) of the author who is behind it. Especially in the Age of New Media when information is so readily available, and a nation discovers from an online social media site that the most sought-after terrorist in the last decade is dead 45 minutes before the President addresses the country, the author must rise as the legitimizing force behind writing.

2. Foucault argued in the late 70s that the author is defined as having a constant level of value, theoretical coherence, structural unity, and being a historical figure that transcends events (Foucault, 554 ). These result in the author having a recognizable and consistent style. In the Age of the New Media where originality is a “fuzzy” space as Fitzgerald points out in her lecture, authors must maintain this structural unity and theoretical coherence to make them distinguishable.

3. The role of the author is to provide unity for his or her texts since maturation and growth can explain inconsistencies in the writing of the same author (Foucault 552). More specifically, Foucault argues that the author serves to “neutralize the contradictions that may emerge in a series of texts.”For example, J.K. Rowling is famous for her Harry Potter books but she recently published a more mature novel for a more adult audience. In Rowling’s example, we see the maturation of a writing style to appeal to a more specific audience. In another example, Elizabeth Gilbert’s personal anecdotal novel-turned Hollywood film Eat, Pray, Love intrigued audiences because they witnessed the maturation of the author as the story progressed.  The New Media authors have the responsibility of growing alongside their writing, and often, their readers.

4. The proximity of audience and author would not be possible if we did not have access to social media networks. In the Age of the New Media, it is the author’s responsibility to respond to the cult of celebrity around his or her work. Social media outlets like twitter, facebook, and personal blogs, are tools to revitalize the cult of celebrity around the author and let readers into the lives of their favorite writers. Authors do not have to abandon their image of celebrity to make way for film actors. Social media is helping authorship be “cool” again.

5. The author in the Age of New Media must adjust to the nature of online discourse which encourages “process over product” as Kathleen Fitzpatrick argues in her lecture “The Future of Authorship.”

6. Directly linked to the latter point, the author in the Age of New Media must consider “clicks” and “links” as a means of scholarly dialogue and cooperation. Whereas in the era of print text, scholarly writing involved individualistic examination, today authors must be open to receive feedback through direct comments online. Also as Fitzpatrick argues, this online discourse will help alleviate the anxieties that haunt authors when it comes to working for a finished product. Online dialogue in blogs and websites makes the process of writing an ongoing conversation, a continual collaboration.

7. The New Media author must seek to surprise and engage readers by producing online or computer-based texts that do not necessarily have to be easily reproducible on print. Exploring new media such as shorts clips or graphics integrated into text can help the author adapt to new technology.

8. Finally the author of the Age of New Media must learn of the benefits of sharing as opposed to hoarding what Kathleen Fitzpatrick refers to as “intellectual property.” Authors must be willing to give up that intellectual property for the advancement of society and broadening of knowledge. This act of sacrifice, or rather, exchange, will help reach a wider readership which should ultimately be the goal of the author.

Archaeology is THE discipline of things - the history of design, innovation, creativity, how people get on with the material world, materiality itself.

Archaeologists deal in the life of things.

Archaeology is also our only access to a long term perspective on history and what it is to be human Archaeological evidence frequently provides insights counter to the great narratives of history that we have grown so used to over the last couple of centuries.

I have researched megalithic monuments in an archaeology of the prehistoric body, ancient Greek perfume jars in the early city state, the design of contemporary beer cans, managed a project with DaimlerChrysler to develop a model of the car interior of 2015, in an archaeology of the contemporary past. My current fieldwork is revisiting an old genre of writing on the land - chorography - in a study of the Roman borders with Scotland - how to understand and represent a region, in the context of imperial incursion and local response.

Archaeology stretches from genetics to art history, includes laboratory study, fieldwork and survey, statistical analysis, and textual interpretation, combining media old and new, from graphics to virtual reality. I am committed to hybrid practice where art becomes scientific research, where the academy becomes an art studio, where pedagogy mingles with outreach into the community and industry, where practice can be research, where old disciplinary divisions give way to a committed address to matters of common human concern.

All made possible by our newly fashioned freedoms of digital authorship, collegiality, collaboration and creativity.

New Humanities Post disciplinary practices ...

shifting a custodial model of stewardship - looking after the past

to one of production and creativity - working on what remains to help guide us now and for the future.

1. Pricing
In general I want the pricing model to be simple and transparent. I don't mind a slight difference in pricing between movies with regard to the age of the movie.

Rentals should not exceed 1/3 of the cinema price.

Purchases should not exceed the cinema price.

Monthly flat rate prices should not exceed 3 visits to the cinema.

TV shows should cost 1/3 the price of movies.

Payments are for the content, not bandwidth.

2. Languages

I can obtain the audio in every language produced for the content.

After purchasing a movie, all the languages are available.

Fans are legally allowed to create and share subtitles for any content.

3. Convenience
The content I paid for is instantly available.

Content is delivered without ads, or disrupting infringement warnings.

I can find movies or TV shows by year, director, language, country, genre, iMDB ID, etc.

4. Choice And Release Dates

The release date is global. There are no limits regarding the country I live in.

I can download nearly every movie ever made.

5. Rights

I can watch the movie on any device, without any differences in how the movie is presented.

Movies are not bound to the service provider, and must be DRM-free in the case of purchases.

I can easily understand my rights regarding movies that I rent, buy, or stream at a flat rate.",<em>Don't Make Me Steal Digital Consumption Manifesto</em>,,,,2014-08-08T21:20:51+00:00,4,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/4,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=62,62,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T14:23:38+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Open Access, Piracy",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/62

a manifesto for art in the age of the internet

1. Participate in this world of realtime, distributed, social, immersive, shared, and collaborative media. New game, new rules.

2. Buy art online, like everything else. Buy it like you would a book, not a car. Pass it on like you would a book, too.

3. Buy direct from the artist when you can. Trust your own taste, take a chance. You don’t need a critic, a curator, or a gallery holding your hand. (Which isn’t to say you might not like them; curators in particular tend to be very interesting people.)

4. Buy art for any reason at all: whim, passion, investment, fetish, curiosity, bragging rights, respect, delight, nostalgia.

5. Not all art can be bought; some art that can be bought is only affordable by the rich. Enjoy what you find anyway. Not everything has to be owned.

6. Link the art that you find, comment on it, blog about it, get the word out.

7. Talk to artists online and off, question them, guide them, cheer them, challenge them, make friends with them. They only sometimes bite.

8. Open the door to sharing: encourage artists you know to make some of their work under a Creative Commons license.

9. Bring your own art to the net. Make culture happen.

We are transhumans.

Our art integrates the most eminent progression
of creativity and sensibility
merged by discovery.

I am the architect of my existence. My art reflects my vision and represents my values. 
It conveys the very essence of my being—coalescing imagination and insight, challenging all limits.

We are exploring how current and future technologies affect our senses, our cognition and our lives. 
Our attention to  these relationships become fields of art as we participate in the most immediate and 
vital  issues for transhumanity—extending life, augmenting intelligence and creativity, exploring the universe. 

Artists, as communicators, bring together the passions, the dreams and the hopes of transhumanity and 
express these emotions in ways that touch us deeply.  
Transhumanist Arts reflects an extropic appreciation of aesthetics  in a technologically enhanced world.

We are voices of transhumanity. Our voices are a synthesis, rhythm and exploration of imagination.

The Transhumanist Arts movement and its genres regard art as more than an artifact. 
Art influences social and cultural change: how we live and who we are. 
It creates a sense of self, art as being, autonomous yet connected to culture’s 
continuum. How we accomplish our intentions is a matter of selective individual choice—
whether abstract or representational, whether artifact or conceptual. 
Our criteria for art remain open and we welcome cross-disciplinary innovations.

As we move into the 21st Century, 
Transhumanist Arts and Extropic Art will suffuse the universe around us. 
Our unique ingenuity will spread far out into the capillaries of our culture. 
We are active participants in our own evolution from human to posthuman. 
We are shaping the image—the design and the essence—of what we are becoming.

The undersigned, being alternately pissed off and bored, need a means of speculation and asserting a different set of values with which to re-imagine the future. In looking for a new framework for black diasporic artistic production, we are temporarily united in the following actions.

***The Mundane Afrofuturists recognize that:***

We did not originate in the cosmos.

The connection between Middle Passage and space travel is tenuous at best.

Out of five hundred thirty-four space travelers, fourteen have been black. An all-black crew is unlikely.

Magic interstellar travel and/or the wondrous communication grid can lead to an illusion of outer space and cyberspace as egalitarian.

This dream of utopia can encourage us to forget that outer space will not save us from injustice and that cyberspace was prefigured upon a ""master/slave"" relationship.

While we are often Othered, we are not aliens.

Though our ancestors were mutilated, we are not mutants.

Post-black is a misnomer.

Post-colonialism is too.

The most likely future is one in which we only have ourselves and this planet.

***The Mundane Afrofuturists rejoice in:***

Piling up unexamined and hackneyed tropes, and setting them alight.

Gazing upon their bonfire of the Stupidities, which includes, but is not exclusively limited to:

Jive-talking aliens;

Jive-talking mutants;

Magical negroes;

Enormous self-control in light of great suffering;

Great suffering as our natural state of existence;

Inexplicable skill in the martial arts;

Reference to Wu Tang;

Reference to Sun Ra;

Reference to Parliament Funkadelic and/or George Clinton;

Reference to Janelle Monáe;

Obvious, heavy-handed allusions to double-consciousness;

Desexualized protagonists;

White slavery;

Egyptian mythology and iconography;

The inner city;

Metallic colors;

Sassiness;

Platform shoes;

Continue at will… 

***We also recognize:***

The harmless fun that these and all the other Stupidities have brought to millions of people.

The harmless fun that burning the Stupidities will bring to millions of people.

The imaginative challenge that awaits any Mundane Afrofuturist author who accepts that this is it: Earth is all we have. What will we do with it?

The chastening but hopefully enlivening effect of imagining a world without fantasy bolt-holes: no portals to the Egyptian kingdoms, no deep dives to Drexciya, no flying Africans to whisk us off to the Promised Land.

The possibilities of a new focus on black humanity: our science, technology, culture, politics, religions, individuality, needs, dreams, hopes, and failings.

The surge of bedazzlement and wonder that awaits us as we contemplate our own cosmology of blackness and our possible futures.

The relief of recognizing our authority. We will root our narratives in a critique of normative, white validation. Since ""fact"" and ""science"" have been used throughout history to serve white supremacy, we will focus on an emotionally true, vernacular reality.

The understanding that our ""twoness"" is inherently contemporary, even futuristic. DuBois asks how it feels to be a problem. Ol’ Dirty Bastard says ""If I got a problem, a problem's got a problem 'til it’s gone.""

An awakening sense of the awesome power of the black imagination: to protect, to create, to destroy, to propel ourselves towards what poet Elizabeth Alexander describes as ""a metaphysical space beyond the black public everyday toward power and wild imagination.""

The opportunity to make sense of the nonsense that regularly—and sometimes violently—accents black life.

The electric feeling that Mundane Afrofuturism is the ultimate laboratory for worldbuilding outside of imperialist, capitalist, white patriarchy.

The sense that the rituals and inconsistencies of daily life are compelling, dynamic, and utterly strange.

Mundane Afrofuturism opens a number of themes and flavors to intertextuality, double entendre, politics, incongruity, polyphony, and collective first-person—techniques that we have used for years to make meaning.

***The Mundane Afrofuturists promise:***

To produce a collection of Mundane Afrofuturist literature that follows these rules:

No interstellar travel—travel is limited to within the solar system and is difficult, time consuming, and expensive.

No inexplicable end to racism—dismantling white supremacy would be complex, violent, and have global impact.

No aliens unless the connection is distant, difficult, tenuous, and expensive—and they have no interstellar travel either.

No internment camps for blacks, aliens, or black aliens.

No Martians, Venusians, etc.

No forgetting about political, racial, social, economic, and geographic struggles.

No alternative universes.

No revisionist history.

No magic or supernatural elements.

No Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, or Bucks.

No time travel or teleportation.

No Mammies, Jezebels, or Sapphires.

Not to let Mundane Afrofuturism cramp their style, as if it could.

To burn this manifesto as soon as it gets boring.

— Martine Syms & whomever will join me in the future of black imagination.

By Curt Cloninger, 3 October 2012
Art / Computing / Posthumanist
At this high-point of high-tech, machines are producing aesthetic experiences for us as never before. Should we respectfully thank them and consider ourselves their peers? Curt Cloninger suggests something more irreverent

Aesthetic experience is always asymmetrical; it needs to be posed in terms of a subject, as well as an object.
– Steven Shaviro
 
What Is the ‘New Aesthetic’?
 
If, according to Debord, ‘the spectacle is capital accumulated to such a degree that it becomes an image’, then the New Aesthetic is technology accumulated to such a degree that it becomes an image. The New Aesthetic (NA) image is a special kind of image – an image which is bodily, affectively sussable by humans. The NA image is not merely (or even) an image to be intellectually pondered by humans. You ‘get it’ before you understand it (if you ever even come to understand it).
 
‘Things’ don't affectively suss the NA image. Only humans ‘get it’.
 
The New Aesthetic is not new (or it has always already been perpetually new). The fact that the NA has recently hit some sort of pop-meme coagulation tipping point (and acquired an ontological name) is merely evidence that technology has finally accumulated to the point of being easily and widely recognised as a collection of Tumblr images without needing to be supported or explained by any underlying theory whatsoever. (Indeed, James Bridle's Tumblr launched the New Aesthetic meme, and Bruce Sterling's journalistic blog dispersed it.) The New Aesthetic has been intuited by hands-on coders for decades (perhaps centuries). It has been discussed by media theorists for at least as long. This is why old school media artists like Mez Breeze and old school media theorists like Simon Biggs (on old school listservs like NetBehaviour) are left fairly unimpressed with the current ‘gee whiz’ enthusiasm about the New Aesthetic. ‘The future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed’ (William Gibson, in some places as early as 1993). The future is (always already) in the process of becoming ever more evenly distributed.
 
When a meme (like ‘the New Aesthetic’) is initially introduced and received, it is arguably fruitful to leave off theorising about it and avoid trying to codify it. Let speculation and confusion reign and see where things lead. This approach works fine in the beginning; but after a while, it leads to the worst kind of lowest-common-denominator, self-referential, reblogged intellectual sludge.
 
The ‘New Aesthetic movement’ exists only in the imaginations of a group of bloggers promoting an agenda for which I have no sympathy whatsoever: actor-network theory spiced with pan-psychist metaphysics and morsels of process philosophy. I don’t believe the internet is an appropriate medium for serious artistic debate; nor do I believe it is acceptable to try to concoct an artistic movement online by using blogs to exploit the misguided enthusiasm of impressionable graduate students. I agree with Deleuze’s remark that ultimately the most basic task of art is to impede stupidity, so I see little artistic merit in a ‘movement’ whose most signal achievement thus far is to have generated an online orgy of stupidity. (Ray Brassier, in a 2011 interview for the Polish journal Kronos)
 
I have taken the liberty of replacing ‘speculative realist’ with ‘New Aesthetic’, ‘philosophical’ with ‘artistic’, and ‘philosophy’ with ‘art’.
 
The New Aesthetic is not a single aesthetic. Drone technology produces its own visual aesthetics. Google Maps produces its own visual aesthetics. Generative Processing code produces its own visual aesthetics. Glitches across various media, compression algorithms, and hardware displays produce their own visual aesthetics. These myriad aesthetics are each as singular and unique as the entangled culture/nature histories which led to the development and deployment of these various technologies and their gradual accumulation into human-sussable images.
 
The term ‘New Aesthetic’ is similar to the term ‘New Media’. When your descriptive adjective is as vague as ‘new’ (or ‘modern’ or ‘contemporary’), then all ontological constraints are off. Your movement is open to embrace ‘what's happenin'’ in the [future-]now.
 
The speculative playing field of the New Aesthetic is even broader than the speculative playing field of New Media; because ‘media’ are still indebted to the technical, formal, material constraints; whereas aesthetics (even ‘old’ Kantian aesthetics) have always been philosophically malleable.
 
Those less theoretically inclined might argue that since the New Aesthetic begins with an affectively intuited image, that's where it should end. Yo Bros, I’m really happy for you. Imma let you finish, but...
 
The New Aesthetic is not a new flavour of aesthetics. At best, and properly understood, it is a new way of understanding aesthetics altogether, one that renegotiates the relationship between human-subject and non-human-object. Perhaps we need a less historically-encrusted word for this ‘new’ relationship than ‘aesthetic’. But lets keep ‘aesthetic’ for now. It forces us to revisit Kant, Schiller, Freud, Heidegger, and Whitehead; and those guys had a lot of Tumblr followers back in the day.
 
‘I'm lost in the dark / Lend me your teeth.’ (Devendra Banhart, 2002). Post-Media theorist and curator Domenico Quaranta says the New Aesthetic will never be a critical criteria for art unless it grows some theoretical teeth. Currently, it is too preoccupied with surface sheen and not concerned enough with cultural analysis. Agreed. So let's try to grow it some teeth and see what happens...
 
 
A Process Without a Singular ‘Aesthetic’ Intentionality
 
The New Aesthetic image is like outsider art incidentally created by systems.
 
The New Aesthetic is indifferent to mimesis. The NA image is not the re-presentation of an object. The NA image is the incidental visual residue of the performance or enactment of a process. The process never intentionally alters itself in order to achieve the ‘goal’ of the NA image. The NA image is a trace, a remnant, a remainder, a residue, a (potential) clue. The ‘subject’ of the NA image (when sussed, aright) is the process itself. In this sense, the New Aesthetic is akin to process art, if we substitute ‘world’ for ‘studio’ and ‘human/non-human entanglements’ for ‘artist’.
 
The New Aesthetic image is a Leibnizian ‘texture’. It reveals more about the processes and systems that ‘produced’ it than it does about itself.
 
Technology was never evolving toward the production of this or that NA image. Beware of teleology! Technology was never trying to make this or that NA image. Beware of anthropocentrism! (Especially beware of the kind of anthropocentrism committed in the name of overcoming anthropocentrism.)
 
The difference between Pollock and Cage: Pollock's process is still heading toward the production of an aesthetic art object (as judged by his inherited idea of aesthetics). Cage's process is heading toward whatever it winds up being. For Cage, chance operations become a vehicle to escape inherited notions of aesthetics. New Aesthetic images are produced by processes that fall somewhere between Pollock and Cage. NA images are not produced solely by randomness, nor are they produced in order to conform to a pre-conceived human aesthetic. NA images are produced by entangled nature/culture systems. Thus, human will is always partially involved in their production, but it is rarely an aesthetic will heading toward the production of NA images. Usually, it is the will to make more money, modulated through complex technological entanglements which have accumulated to such a degree that NA images are incidentally (although not arbitrarily) produced. To fetishise the NA image as a mere ‘aesthetic’ object is to conveniently ignore the ethical ways in which we are implicit in its production. To fetishistically credit ‘machines’ as the primary agents behind the production of NA images is to conveniently ignore the ethical ways in which we are implicit in their production.
 
The New Aesthetic image, in-and-of-itself, in stasis, is kind of cool. Cooler yet is the way in which the NA image reveals the historical forces that have come together to ‘produce’ it in stasis. Coolest is the way in which the NA image reveals how things are currently coming together in process; and how things may possibly come together in the near future.
 
New Aesthetic images aren't representative, analogous, archetypal, emblematic, or symbolic of any thing else. They are the actual traces and residues of processes and relationships – traces that have arrived in the visual realm and have entered humans via their eyes. NA images don't symbolise or represent the processes that have led to their creation. Instead, they are incidentally thrown into the world by those processes. The way backwards from the images toward the processes themselves is much more complicated that simply intellectually thinking about what these images look ‘like’. We initially apperceive NA images bodily and affectively. They are freaky. They trip us out. Only later are we able to reflect on them analytically, letting their own systemic contours and folds guide our theoretical thought.
 
Because NA images are apperceived and explored along affective lines, submitting these images to pre-existing modes of critical theory (Marxism, feminism, post-humanism, futurist journalism) may not be enough. What escapes may be more fruitful than what is captured.
 
Which thinkers are most relevant to the development of a New Aesthetic theory? Deleuze starts to become pragmatically (not just speculatively) relevant. (This might turn out to be ‘his century’ after all.) Bruno Latour becomes increasingly relevant. Benjamin and Debord remain relevant, but less for their Marxism than their moxie. Baudrillard is a wild goose chase (but then he always was). Graham Harman is a bit of a detour (leading to a dead-end overlooking a noble vista). Whitehead is spot on (but then he always was).
 
We are not merely left to choose between cyber-utopianism and cyber-dystopianism. Because, like modernism/postmodernism, utopia/dystopia are two sides of the same teleological coin. As Bruno Latour rightly asserts, we have never been modern, we just fooled ourselves into thinking we were. When the truly new emerges, if it is indeed properly new, it won't look like utopia, dystopia, modernism, or postmodernism. It will look (and feel) monstrous and uncanny. ‘The future can only be anticipated in the form of absolute danger. It is that which breaks absolutely with constituted normality and can only be proclaimed, presented, as a sort of monstrosity.’ (Derrida, 1967).
 
 
New Aesthetic Images are Affectively Sussed By Humans, Not by Things
 
An overdub has no choice / an image cannot rejoice’
– Carole King, 1968
 
It bears repeating: ‘Things’ don't affectively suss New Aesthetic images. Only humans ‘get’ NA images. There is no machine ‘aesthetic’, no robotic ‘vision’. Humans invent aesthetic theories regarding the interpretation of machine-generated images. Machines do not invent aesthetic theories regarding the interpretation of circuit-generated images. Likewise, no rock ever invented an ontology. Humans develop ontologies which include rocks. Humans may even philosophically speculate what ontologies rocks might invent. But rocks-themselves do not invent rock-centric ontologies. Nor do rocks-themselves philosophically speculate what ontologies dirt might invent.
 
If there were a clear dividing line between humans and things, then the ‘aesthetics’ of the New Aesthetic would lie mostly on the side of humans. Between humans and things, there is no clear dividing line.
 
The New Aesthetic is not just about intellectually ‘getting it’ when it comes to technology. Heck, Paul Simon ‘gets it’ as early as 1986:
 
The bomb in the baby carriage was wired to the radio... The way the camera follows us in slo-mo. The way we look to us all. The way we look to a distant constellation that's dying in a corner of the sky. These are days of miracle and wonder... And the dead sand falling on the children, the mothers, and the fathers, and the automatic earth... Medicine is magical and magical is art... lasers in the jungle somewhere... Staccato signals of constant information. A loose affiliation of millionaires and billionaires.
 
Simon's lyric reads like a (much more poetic) version of any number of summative lists recently offered to catalogue the underlying technologies of the New Aesthetic. And that's Paul Simon in 1986. Yes, we all get it. We have gotten it for some time now.
 
The most intriguing thing about the New Aesthetic is that we all now ‘get it’ affectively via NA images. Our human bodies have a way of ‘getting it’ before our human intellects do.
 
New Aesthetic images can teach us humans a New Aesthetic. But as we listen to this New Aesthetic, what we are hearing is neither the pure voice of nature nor the adulterated voice of machines. We are listening to systems in the world – a world that we are co-creating, a world of which we are always already a part (never apart).
 
 
Down With Pan-Psychism!
 
Pan-psychism is the idea that all things in the world (rocks, animals, predator drones, weather systems, Hello Kitty lunchboxes) have consciousness. The pipe dream of Artificial Intelligence is related to pan-psychism. Pan-psychism is the played-out rabbit trail of the New Aesthetic. ‘It's a trap!’ (Admiral Ackbar). Just because we've finally come to recognise that things and systems have their own agency and are not merely passive and inert, this doesn't mean that things and systems have consciousness.
 
We humans have become so enamoured of honouring ‘the other’ that we have come to equate self-denigration with ethical behaviour. Not only do we see ourselves as sexist and racist (which we are), we have come to see ourselves as species-ist (animals are people too) and thing-ist (things are people too). The irony is, as we seek to honour things-in-themselves (thus nobly overcoming our anthropocentric narcissism), we extend to things the highest honour we can imagine – humanness! To imbue things and systems with a kind of consciousness is actually the epitome of anthropocentrism. The conquering European must first dress the native up in civilised clothes before she can be treated as an equal. And now we extend the same ridiculous, narcissistic ‘courtesy’ to things.
 
It is not enough that we seek to elevate things to our level; we feel as if we must lower ourselves to thing level. We humans are now no better than things. We are actually mere things ourselves (or mere systems of micro-things, depending on your scalar preferences). And the rocks bow their heads as we pass by, in deference to our enlightened humility.
 
As a result, we humans are hubristically tempted to attribute the uncanniness of New Aesthetic images to the pan-psychic agency of AI technology. ‘Gee, these systems must be sentient (in a way that we humans are sentient), because we humans sure didn't invent these crazy new images.’ This response is half-right and all wrong. We humans had a ‘hand’ in inventing these images, but ours was not the only ‘hand’. Systems, materials, things, assemblages co-invented these NA images with us.
 
 
Up with Pan-Experientialism!
 
Pan-experientialism is the idea that all things in the world experience ‘being’ over time. Forces and events in the world ingress into things in a way that is experienced by those things.
 
Few things have the same qualitative types of experience. Rock-being-ness isn't human-being-ness (and human-being-ness isn't what it used to be). Alfred North Whitehead puts it like this: experience is the base of all being; consciousness is the apex of all being. So although rocks don't think like humans (indeed, rocks don't think at all), at some base level of being, humans and rocks both experience.
 
Furthermore, humans don't consciously ‘think’ everything that we ‘experience’. We affectively and bodily experience all sorts of things we don't ever think at all. Only a fraction of our human experiences ingress into our conscious (or even subconscious) awareness.
 
Pan-experientialism means that humans are a little more like things than we thought, and that things are a little more like humans than we thought. It doesn't mean that humans are mere rocks, or that rocks have consciousness.
 
We need to understand things as vector forces enacting within networks, not as anthropomorphised objects. Yes, thing have agency, but their agency is altogether thingy. Emergent systems (a.k.a. things made up of things) exercise all sorts of funky agency: flocking behaviours, attraction to strange attractors, radical modulations at state-change thresholds. Yes, non-inert behaviours; but not sentient behaviours. A painter enters into a kind of pragmatic dialogue with the viscous and luminous behaviours of her paint. She need not speculate about its withdrawn essence.
 
 
New Aesthetic Images: The Uncanny, the Present-At-Hand, the Sublime
 
Kansas, I've a feeling we're not in Toto any more
– Dorothy (chopped & screwed)
 
Aesthetics are related to both experience and consciousness. Aesthetics are born in experience and arrive at consciousness. No consciousness at which to arrive, no aesthetics. So when we talk about aesthetics, we're mostly talking about humans. (Unless we want to radically re-define aesthetics, in which case we should probably use a different word.)
 
Beginning with Freud: New Aesthetic images are uncanny (unheimlich, un-homelike). If NA images were totally familiar, we would read them as family photos. (They are our new family photos.) If they were totally alien, we would read them as so much white noise. Instead, New Aesthetic images are somewhere in-between, in the Uncanny Valley: that disturbing interzone where something ‘non-human’ is almost human enough to seem ‘human’, but not quite. We recognise ourselves in NA images, but also something other than ourselves; or rather, still ourselves – but ourselves complicated, enmeshed, othered.
 
We humans are developing new, more purposefully affective ways of reading these new images.
 
The only way to read is acrobatically, fast and with lots of background noise (disco music or television), for that encourages more speed and more rapid processing of the information that cannot be processed except as a function of peripheral seeing and distracted absorption… To read poetry carefully and slowly is to miss the point, which is the blur.
– Tan Lin, Cabinet Magazine, Issue 1, 2000/2001
 
On to Heidegger: Graham Harman interprets Heidegger's vorhandenheit (presence-at-hand) as an eruption of the thing out of its normal function in the world (its normal function is zuhandenheit, ‘readiness-to-hand’). The thing was there all along; but we never saw it this way until now. This eruption is a useful way of understanding NA images. NA images are visual eruptions of everyday functioning systems in the world, systems humans never saw in this way until now. Like Heidegger's broken hammer – the carpenter only stops to reflect on it once it stops working as expected.
 
New Aesthetic visuals don't necessarily ‘reveal’ a hidden ‘truth’. It's not as if readiness-to-hand is false and presence-at-hand is true, or vice versa. They are just two simultaneous ways of being in the world. (Heidegger's genius – his ‘sleight of hand’ – was to draw our attention to readiness-to-hand without turning it into presence-at-hand.)
 
As per Bruno Latour (and with Heidegger turning in his grave), our current systems have proliferated and hybridised beyond our ken to strange and complex degrees. New Aesthetic images strike at the heart of the modernist myth that man is master and measure of all things. Something much more trippy is actually happening. We are caught up in a proliferation of hybrid hammers ever breaking.
 
From Heidegger to Kant: New Aesthetic images are more sublime than beautiful. They are sublime because they affectively impact humans in ways which imply the subterranean, ongoing operation of assemblages which have not yet been resolved, and may never resolve; assemblages beyond human mastery, yet in which humans are implicated and entangled. The affective feelings NA images evoke in humans confound Schiller's attempts to reconcile the sensuous and the formal in ‘play’. NA images are neither human ‘art’ nor non-human ‘nature’. They were not created to address a static conception of human nature, nor to dialectically overcome preconceived contradictory drives within human nature. Neither were they created by extra-human forces in order to provide human ‘subjects’ with ‘natural’ objects for aesthetic contemplation. Instead, NA images are residues that result from current ways of being in the world, entangled ways in which humans are ‘always already’ implicated. At their best, NA images challenge humans to re-imagine ‘humanness’ ‘being’ and ‘the world’ altogether.
 
 
Four Summaries, Three Quotations and a Closing Exhortation
 
Matter matters. Things (light, networks, economies, rocks, paint, pixels) have their own agency. Things are already in the world, in dialogue with the world, forming and being formed by other things in the world. Indeed, according to Heidegger, things in relationship with other things make up ‘the world’. No things; no ‘world’. Things don’t consciously ‘know stuff’ about the world, but... things behave in ways derived from their history in the world and from their current entanglements with the world. Things are caught up in the world (of other things), and the world is caught up in things.
 
‘What might things make of the New Aesthetic?’ is not a very useful question. ‘What might humans make of the New Aesthetic once we realise that we have been entangled with things all along?’ is a more useful question. Bruno Latour says that modernism was simply a time when humans thought we weren't entangled with things, when actually we were. What we made of that time unawares was an even bigger entangled mess (Latour's term is ‘a proliferation of hybrids’) – atom bombs as inverted guardian angels, global warming debates as orthodox scientific catechisms. At this point, it seems unlikely that we are going to avoid further complex human/thing entanglements, so trying to avoid them is probably something we should try to avoid. On the other hand, we should also avoid passively sitting around, techno-fetishistically dazzled by these ‘spectacular new developments’, blithely watching a real-time documentary of ourselves watching a real-time documentary of ourselves. Probably, we should spend some time figuring out how these systems flow and function so we can more effectively modulate them (or sabotage them), hopefully for reasons other than making more money.
 
All of this stuff is cool. Does it mean that objects have souls, psyches, withdrawn essences, or intelligences? No. Does it mean that humans are merely one thing among many things, no more or less endowed with agency? No.
 
It does mean that humans are recursively entangled with things and forces in increasingly problematic ways (Bruno Latour told us this in 1991.) Furthermore, it means that humans affectively experience all sorts of things in the world prior to (and often without ever) cognitively becoming aware of these experiences; it means that things also affectively ‘experience’ forces in the world; and it means that systems, ideas, networks, entanglements, forces, events, technologies, animals, humans and objects are all ‘things’ in ‘the world’. (Whitehead told us this in 1927. His word for ‘things’ is ‘entities.’) The fact that a bunch of people are currently talking about all this stuff online simply means that our technology has accumulated to such a degree that it has become an image – an image we can all (tech geeks, object oriented philosophers, sci-fi journalists, tumblr-ing graphic designers, twenty-something net.artists, rocks) affectively suss.

Technology is the campfire around which we tell our stories. –Laurie Anderson

The past several years has witnessed the emergence of new ways to experience the World Wide Web. The term “Web 2.0” has been coined to describe the Web’s transition from a collection of static Web sites containing information to a more dynamic, interactive, and social, participatory culture. Web 2.0 tools and services like blogs, wikis, podcasting, photo, video, and music-sharing sites, RSS, online gaming, real-time messaging, social networks, social bookmarking, mashups, and virtual worlds are now being used daily by millions of people around the globe to connect, communicate, collaborate, create, and share content with each other.

The widespread availability and use of these participatory media tools coupled with ubiquitous Internet access has led to profound changes in way people interact with information and how they work, play, shop, and learn. Instead of being passive consumers of information prepared by others, more and more Web users, including young people, are becoming producers of their own content and media products, and in the process are transforming cultural, educational, economic, and political institutions and practices. What are the implications of this paradigm shift for art education? Specifically, what role should art education play in educating today’s youth who are growing up in a post-digital world?

First, recognizing that participatory digital media tools provide a direct link to non-school culture, art teachers can (and should) incorporate these technologies to their pedagogy and curricula in order to increase the relevance of the learning experiences offered to their students. This is not to say that “older” more conventional media such as crayons, clay, paint, pencils, paper and the like are any less worthy for their age. All media technologies have a place in school art programs provided that they can help to promote the aims of art education. It’s just that newer forms of technology such as computers, digital cameras, scanners, and online tools deserve special attention in that they permit students to engage in innovative forms of communication, expression and learning using contemporary media rooted in their everyday lives.

Secondly, the use of digital and online tools as expressive art media in schools provides many unique and exciting opportunities for fostering the literacy skills required in the twenty-first century. A child’s need to comprehend and participate in our technological culture today goes far beyond the scope of what is commonly thought of as “literacy” in schools. To be able to read and write through written language is simply not enough. To be “literate” today demands a deep understanding of all media technologies and their potential for human interaction, communication and expression. In this sense, a truly literate person today must not only be able to create, communicate and distribute one’s own messages with new technology tools but also be able to analyze, interpret and evaluate the messages
that one receives in a technology-mediated environment. Gaining such literacy skills requires education.

Lastly, the arts themselves serve to counterbalance the infusion of digital technology into our daily lives. The “computer revolution” of the 1980s brought about dramatic changes of many aspects of contemporary society and more changes are inevitable. While the computer revolution is long over, new waves of technology continue to come at us as the fields of computers, consumer electronics, cable TV, and telecommunications merge together. This onslaught of super gadgets and digital services are transforming our lives, but some may wonder if for the better? In spite of all the promises and benefits of high technology, its drawbacks are too great to ignore. In particular, its potential for fostering glitz over substance, speed over sustained effort, and entertainment over critical reflection should be of concern to all of us—especially as art teachers.

If the intent of public education is to prepare children to become thinking, caring, contributing members of the twenty-first century, we must not allow technological advancements to overwhelm them, to numb their aesthetic sensibilities, or to dictate their personal identities. Rather, we must help children sustain and celebrate their humanness in a highly technologized world. In this context, the arts in schools are a curricular necessity for they provide fertile ground for cultivating in children those “high touch” sensibilities and values that we intuitively feel are essential for living full and productive lives in an increasingly artificial “high tech” environment. Some of these uniquely human qualities nurtured in arts classrooms include: the willingness to take chances, challenge convention, and explore the unknown; the desire to work honestly, with self-discipline, while acknowledging the success or failure of one’s endeavors; the ability to appraise and defend what is personally and socially important; as well as the capacity to appreciate the warmth of a cello being bowed, the gracefulness of a ballet dancer, the unpredictability of watercolor paint being applied to a wet surface, the pliability of clay being formed on a potter’s wheel, and the excitement of a live dramatic performance.

In the end, whatever technologies are brought to bear on the arts learning process, children must learn to use the tools they have available to think, to imagine, to create, to take on the impossible, to play with ideas, to explore, and to feel what it means to be human. As art educators, seeing to it that this kind of authentic learning takes place in our classrooms may be the greatest investment we make in our children’s future.

The aim of this manifesto is to encourage art teachers to embrace the opportunities and challenges brought on by the introduction of participatory media tools into their classrooms. It works from the premise that increased use of these new technologies will not in itself lead to improved art learning; rather, technology is a catalyst that can provide new ways to enhance and in some cases transform art learning if it is appropriately engaged through challenging curriculum goals and sound pedagogical practices. With that in mind, the following ten guidelines can help art teachers make informed decisions about how to make the best use of Web 2.0 tools in their classrooms.

10 Guidelines for Weaving Participatory Media Technologies into an Art Classroom

1. Think and act anew.
Art Education 2.0 is about moving beyond thinking of the Web simply as a place to search for images and information to using participatory media tools to exchange ideas and resources, to collaborate with others, to demonstrate our own creativity and learning before a worldwide audience, and to comment on the ideas and work of others. The Web is not only a great information resource; it’s also a great big stage!

2. Focus on outcomes, not tools.
Art Education 2.0 isn’t about teaching technology. It’s about using technology available to build a richer classroom environment in which the teacher and students pursue worthwhile curriculum goals. Thus, any decisions regarding use of the Web 2.0 tools and other technologies in the art classroom needs to be anchored in what students are expected to learn and accomplish with those tools.

3. Embed technology use into the whole art curriculum.
Art Education 2.0 is about making meaningful connections between content, pedagogy, learning goals, and technology use throughout the art curriculum, rather than treating technology as an add-on. The use of tools, both old and new, for expressive and creative purposes shapes our culture. Thus it should be seen as something integral to what we do in art classrooms and studios, not as something that is separate from or peripheral to the art curriculum.

4. Blend the new with the old, high-tech with high-touch, the global with the local.
Art Education 2.0 is about recognizing the benefits and limitations of both new and conventional media technologies when deciding what is best for students. There are times when using a Web-based resource makes sense, and there are times when the school’s library, an art history textbook, or a No.2 pencil might better suit students’ needs. Wherever appropriate, students should be encouraged to mix digital media with conventional art media, blend high-tech with high touch, and combine online resources with local resources to accomplish their artistic and learning goals.

5. Build global connections.
Art Education 2.0 is about connectedness and global learning. From arranging a student art exchange with another classroom on another country, to participating in an global art project with other schools, to searching for international art teachers to share art lessons and experiences with, participatory media tools offer a multitude of ways to connect, communicate, and collaborate with peers and colleagues around the world.

6. Use free and open source software and tools.
Art Education 2.0 is about using free Web-based tools and open source software whenever possible  to support teaching and learning activities in the classroom The availability of free online application tools (like Blogger, Flickr, and Diigo) together with open-source software (like Firefox, GIMP, and Blender) distributed at little or no cost for public use and modification, offer a wide assortment of alternatives to commercially purchased software. Taking advantage of these options can be especially helpful to art teachers working within tight school budgets.

7. Use Creative Commons-licensed materials in media products.
Art Education 2.0 is about promoting responsible use of technology in the classroom. With multimedia projects increasing popular in schools, teachers and students need to be aware that the use of copyright-protected materials without permission restricts their ability to distribute or publish their work online. As an alternative, Creative Commons (CC) licensing enables content creators to allow others to copy, modify and distribute their work under the conditions they specify, like giving proper credit to the original source of the materials used. Sites that promote CC use (like Flickr and Wikimedia) are excellent sources of mages, video clips, audio files, and text materials for use in multimedia projects.

8. Learn with your students.
Art Education 2.0 is about flattening the classroom so that everyone is a learner and anyone can be a teacher. It’s about viewing students as partners in learning how to work with participatory media tools in the classroom to achieve the best results. Their feedback will help you to shape more effective pedagogical approaches to the Web for future students.

9. Encourage personal expression, collaboration and community .
Art Education 2.0 is about fostering and participating in communities of creativity and knowledge sharing. While still celebrating individualism, introducing social participatory media into the art curriculum calls for more attention to the social aspects of learning by offering projects and activities in which students work together to achieve shared artistic and educational goals. Doing so creates a richer, more diverse classroom environment within which students actively learn from each other as well as on their own.

10. Share what your students are doing with a world audience.
Art Education 2.0 is about seeking authentic methods of sharing student learning and work with a worldwide audience. Art teachers have long used the recognition that comes with the public display of work as a way of motivating students. The Web adds a powerful new twist to this practice. Instead of the teacher being the one responsible for exhibiting students’ accomplishments, the students themselves can use participatory media tools to show the world what they know and are able to do.

Artistic Critique in the 21st Century

In the twentieth century, art was judged with respect to the existing state of the medium. What mattered was the kind of rupture it made, the unexpected formal elements it brought into play, the way it displaced the conventions of the genre or the tradition. The prize at the end of the evaluative process was a different sense of what art could be, a new realm of possibility for the aesthetic. Today all that has changed, definitively.

The backdrop against which art now stands out is a particular state of society. What an installation, a performance, a concept or a mediated image can do is to mark a possible or real shift with respect to the laws, the customs, the measures, the mores, the technical and organizational devices that define how we must behave and how we may relate to each other at a given time and in a given place. What we look for in art is a different way to live, a fresh chance at coexistence.

How does that chance come to be? Expression unleashes affect, and affect is what touches. Presence, gesture and speech transform the quality of contact between people, they create both breaks and junctions; and the expressive techniques of art are able to multiply those immediate changes along a thousand pathways of the mind and the senses. An artistic event does not need an objective judge. You know it has happened when you can bring something else into existence in its wake. Artistic activism is affectivism, it opens up expanding territories. These territories are occupied by the sharing of a double difference: a split from the private self in which each person was formerly enclosed, and from the social order which imposed that particular type of privacy or privation.

When a territory of possibility emerges it changes the social map, like a landslide, a flood or a volcano do in nature. The easiest way for society to protect its existing form is simple denial, pretending the change never happened: and that actually works in the landscape of mentalities. An affective territory disappears if it isn’t elaborated, constructed, modulated, differentiated, prolonged by new breakthroughs and conjunctions. There is no use defending such territories, and even believing in them is only the barest beginning. What they urgently need is to be developed, with forms, rhythms, inventions, discourses, practices, styles, technologies – in short, with cultural codes. An emergent territory is only as good as the codes that sustain it. Every social movement, every shift in the geography of the heart and revolution in the balance of the senses needs its aesthetics, its grammar, its science and its legalisms. Which means that every new territory needs artists, technicians, intellectuals, universities. But the problem is, the expert bodies that already exist are fortresses defending themselves against other fortresses.

Activism has to confront real obstacles: war, poverty, class and racial oppression, creeping fascism, venomous neoliberalism. But what we face is not so much soldiers with guns as cognitive capital: the knowledge society, an excruciatingly complex order. The striking thing from the affective point of view is the zombie-like character of this society, its fallback to automatic pilot, its cybernetic governance. Neoliberal society is densely regulated, heavily overcoded. Since the control systems are all made by disciplines with strictly calibrated access to other disciplines, the origin of any struggle in the fields of knowledge has to be extradisciplinary. It starts outside the hierarchy of disciplines and moves through them transversally, gaining style, content, competence and discursive force along the way. Extradisciplinary critique is the process whereby affectively charged ideas – or conceptual arts – become essential to social change. But it’s vital to maintain the link between the infinitely communicable idea and the singularly embodied performance.

World society is the theater of affectivist art, the stage on which it appears and the circuit in which it produces transformations. But how can we define this society in existential terms? First, it is clear that a global society now exists, with global communications, transport networks, benchmarked educational systems, standardized technologies, franchised consumption facilities, global finance, commercial law and media fashion. That layer of experience is extensive, but it is thin; it can only claim part of the lifeworld. To engage with affectivist art, to critique it and recreate it, you have to know not only where new territories of sensibility emerge – in which locale, in which historical geography – but also at which scale. Existence in world society is experienced, or becomes aesthetic, as an interplay of scales.

In addition to the global, there is a regional or continental scale, based on the aggregation of populations into economic blocs. You can see it clearly in Europe, but also in North and South America, in the Middle East and in the East Asian network. Make no mistake, there are already affects at this scale, and social movements, and new ways of using both gesture and language, with much more to come in the future. Then there is the national scale, seemingly familiar, the scale with the richest sets of institutions and the deepest historical legacies, where the theaters of mass representation are overwhelmingly established and sunk into phantasmatic inertia. But the national scale in the twenty-first century is also in a febrile state of continuous red alert, hotwired to excess and sometimes even capable of resonating with the radically new. After this comes the territorial scale, long considered the most human: the scale of daily mobilities, the city, the rural landscape, which are the archetypal dimensions of sensibility. This is the abode of popular expression, of the traditional plastic arts, of public space and of nature as a presence coequal with humanity: the scale where subjectivity first expands to meet the unknown.

And so finally we reach the scale of intimacy, of skin, of shared heartbeats and feelings, the scale that goes from families and lovers to people together on a street corner, in a sauna, a living room or a cafe. It would seem that intimacy is irretrievably weighted down in our time, burdened with data and surveillance and seduction, crushed with the determining influence of all the other scales. But intimacy is still an unpredictable force, a space of gestation and therefore a wellspring of gesture, the biological spring from which affect drinks. Only we can traverse all the scales, becoming other along the way. From the lovers’ bed to the wild embrace of the crowd to the alien touch of networks, it may be that intimacy and its artistic expressions are what will astonish the twenty-first century.",<em>The Affectivist Manifesto</em>,,,,2014-08-10T18:30:27+00:00,9,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/9,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=71,71,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T14:17:59+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Affect, Digital Aesthetics",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/71

,,The Malleablists,,"The authors of the <em>Malleable Manifesto no. 1</em> argue that architecture, a profession defined by permanence, has become malleable. Architecture's contemporary focus on malleability is, as the manifesto argues, a result of digital computational technologies. Taken together, digital technology and architecture have conspired to create an 'architecture of malleability.'",,,EN,,,,"<a href=""http://www.themalleablists.org"">http://www.themalleablists.org</a>",,,"<a href=""http://www.themalleablists.org/manifestos/malleable-manifesto-no-1/"">http://www.themalleablists.org/manifestos/malleable-manifesto-no-1/</a>",Digital Architecture,"Malleable Manifesto no. 1

Architects seem to be preoccupied with variability more than ever.  It isn’t hard to understand why, especially when considering contemporary digital culture.  We exist in a world bombarded with opportunities to build new social profiles.  Each of our embodiments somehow performs differently from previous ones.  We update our status instantly ­only to change it moments later.  This culture embraces endless modification and resists resolution.  The lack of terminus in contemporary digital culture removes a fear of commitment and nourishes our desire for the unique.  It is no longer necessary to compromise our intentions in service of permanence.  Iteration, uniqueness, and change are king.  This culture is emerging in architecture as well.  The profession commonly associated with permanence is becoming malleable.

Malleability is not simply a material property.  It is liberation from constraints of resolution that responds to contingency.  To therefore describe something as malleable is to acknowledge an object’s capacity for change in response to a force.  For sake of clarity, let us address a few material property examples.  Rubber stretches only when it is pulled apart.  Ice melts only when heat is applied.  Our typical conception of architecture is to mute these changes, to ultimately ensure stability.  Perhaps this compulsion to freeze is because the idea of continual (and potentially unscripted) change occurring in the built environment is antithetical to our assumption of architects as authors.  How can unscripted change be authored?  We may have this compulsion to halt and stabilize, but it is merely a conceptual act.  Malleability has always existed, for instance, in the various iterations during the design process.  It exists in the inevitable weathering and decay of buildings.[1] It exists in the palimpsest of scars created through occupation. It also exists in a select few projects that resolve the concept with literal movement such as Villa Girasole as a means to track the sun.  Even though malleability has existed in architecture, somehow our discourse turns a blind eye to this truth.  Now is the time to remove this unwarranted aversion to malleability.  Our contemporary architecture process is full of life.  Why do we kill this process to construct the building?

In the past decade, a proliferation of digital manufacturing techniques such as tessellating, contouring, and sectioning[2] have allowed architects to take the first steps toward a digitized malleable architecture. A malleable architecture revolts against the idea of standardized construction, instead taking full advantage of automation.  Through automation, this now more malleable form of architecture is able to compete with standardization in terms of manufacturing efficiency; eliminating the comparative advantage of mass production over mass customization.  Robots could care less if every part is unique.  These exercises in geometric variability in conjunction with the automation of making are allowing architects to generate specific (custom) architectural responses.  The result is a dethroning of modernist universality in favor of a malleable construction unit.

By communicating through computers to machines that create custom parts, architecture is once again free from the oppressive mold of standardization.  Generating complex geometry after complex geometry, bragging about variability and parametric alterations — only to create an architecture frozen in time? Walls bend and flex with the click of a mouse, but—once built—they become static.  Why do we limit ourselves to such methods?  Why are we satisfied with only making curvy ribs and complex perforations?  These clichéd techniques have become a vacuous stylistic exercise originally intended to evoke the effect of dynamism through a temporally static object.  How did this contradiction emerge?  As it turns out, it is extremely difficult to extend the malleable culture beyond the drawing process.

The contemporary design process arguably extended malleability because it is supported by parametric and other computational models, which promote change as a viable approach; however, the extension of the design system into a constructible unit commonly undergoes a freezing moment.  The variability inherent to the design process is unfortunately abandoned at first sight of physicality.  All malleability is removed and all variables are halted.  The system is built in an idealized state.  Perhaps this peculiar moment of freezing is due to the convention of transferring drawings from the architect to the contractor.  If previously, the process operated initially as a highly malleable process in the form of sketching.  The presumption is that this malleability slowly diminishes as it approaches the construction phase where the word ‘change order’ is a death sentence to an architect.  Today, with the aid of digital fabrication, a paradigm shift has occurred.  Change is now embraced as a collaborative opportunity.  Parametric alterations in response to site-specific forces are currently the norm.  This malleability has not only impacted the relationship between the architect and the contractor.  It has also persuaded the architect to indulge in complexity.  When working with a complex figure considered impractical without the aid of digital fabrication, one applies the previously mentioned techniques to break the larger geometry down into construct-able units — a process previously left to the contractor in the form of shop drawings.  By undermining this convention, architects reclaim control, an ethos that has aided in rendering our architecture temporally static.  Ultimately this process is hardly different from the approval of a final set of drawings to be built. Complex geometries mask an otherwise normative architectural process — design, decide, build.  Instead, the malleable process should be embraced for its potential to revolutionize our concept of animating space creation[3], not simply break it down into unique construction units.

In recent years, a deluge of projects have introduced malleability in the form of a generative process.  Such projects signal a paradigmatic shift in our perception of the design process.  Take for example the works of Axel Killian, Supermaenouvre, and Kokkugia.  These works use animation to represent and promote this malleable design process; however, the process is anything but an animation.  Animations are linear and pre-determined, while these works are real time applications responding to inputs.  Some of these applications even produce varied results each time they run.  This process embraces malleability and rejects the notion that authorship is determined by static results instead of processes.  Working on a foundation created by analog studies[4], these demonstrations of real time feedback, aided by computers, evolved the perception of authorship.  As many of these designs bear root in mathematics as generators, authorship is blurry and oftentimes indefinable. The architects listed above exemplify such blurring every time they publish their scripts, programs, and algorithms as open source code to the public.   Anyone is welcome to re-author these works.  This open source policy is in it-self a vehicle for malleability.  Unfortunately the advancement of malleability is halted every time the stop button is slammed and the permanent solution selected — thereby re-inserting authorship into the equation.  Projecting to the future — physical architecture will became a manifestation of this conceptually fluid process.  This process does not start or end in order to create, but rather is continual and responsive in simultaneous reciprocity with the built form and it’s environment, thus reconsidering the hindrance of authorship. These speculative research projects do advance our tendency towards malleability in architecture, but mainly in conception and process.  Bridging the gap to physicality appears to be an insurmountable task proving difficult — but not impossible.

Other architects apply the concept of malleability to physical objects.  Here, it is important to note that movement does not characterize the results of these architects’ research practices.  That would be an all-too-easy categorization of their work.  Like architects who embrace algorithmic techniques in service of their designs, those who apply the concept of malleability in physical objects do so by privileging feedback. Making a tower that spins and twists does not advance the discourse.  Making a physical object that responds to information with real time feedback does.  For example, with a time-lapse camera, one may record the decay of a building over time, and ultimately produce a video of the slow (and now fast) erosion of an object.  This video would of course be compelling and seductive, but it is important to separate the seduction of change, movement, and kinetics from this definition of malleability.  Decay does not occur for the sake of change.  It occurs in response to external forces, be they wind, water, organic matter, or others.  It is not scripted, not pre-determined.

One strong example of a malleable object is the Defensible Dressby the research and design team of Eric Höweler and Meejin Yoon.  This dress exemplifies physical malleability through a focused exercise in making.  Aided by sensors and actuators, the dress recognizes an intruder approaching through a measurement of distance.  It reacts to this information by expanding and defending its host.  This dress does one thing and one thing only — it defends. Höweler and Yoon pick up where the process driven researchers left off, but the project lacks the versatility the algorithms demonstrate so well.  Projecting to the future, we would find a dress that defends and embraces, harasses, or even ignores.

A slightly more dynamic example would be the Hyposurface Wall by Marc Goulthorpe of Decoi.  Decoi’s work straddles a fine line between the virtual and physical—the Hyposurface Wall is not only an architectural object that responds to real-time feedback, but it is also operated by a software that is endlessly editable.  And like any physical project to date, this wall is subjected to constraints, the largest being the configuration of the standardized units that aggregate to make the whole.  This malleability bypasses the configuration and takes refuge in the software and kinetic interaction.

Physical malleability need not be actuated.  Take for example Logic Matter by Skylar Tibbits of SJET.  This project extends the body of research in physical computation[5] into the discourse of architecture.  Tibbits claims “This system suggests a new paradigm for computing, one that materializes the capabilities of a hard drive and processor from a single sequence of inputs.”[6] Will we approach a time when the architecture itself is computing?  I argue we already have.  We are simply denying it.

I am not calling for a strictly kinetic architecture.  I am calling for our discourse to admit to itself our yearning for change.  I am calling for the recognition that architecture is already malleable.  I am calling for a abolishment of the assumption our profession is dedicated to permanence and stability.  I am calling for an architecture where our conception of variability and response extend beyond the CAD program used to design it, through the CAM process that makes it, and to the architecture itself.  This malleable concept must endure beyond the software.  Imagine a world where your individual environment responds to both you as well as your greater surrounding.   Imagine a future where the built environment and design process work in reciprocity, responding to various agents of information.  Imagine a future where architecture is unshackled from its falsely assumed allegiance to permanence.  This future will house an architecture of malleability.  It will be anything but static.

We are dedicated to
variability
reciprocity between drawing and making
living architecture
We revolt against
standardization
the assumption that architects are not responsible for the means and methods of making
the death of architecture

Patrik Schumacher, London 2008
Presented and discussed at the Dark Side Club1 , 11th Architecture Biennale, Venice 2008

We pursue the parametric design paradigm all the way, penetrating into all corners of the discipline. Systematic, adaptive variation, continuous differentiation (rather than mere variety), and dynamic, parametric figuration concerns all design tasks from urbanism to the level of tectonic detail, interior furnishings and the world of products.

Architecture finds itself at the mid-point of an ongoing cycle of innovative adaptation – retooling the discipline and adapting the architectural and urban environment to the socio-economic era of post-fordism. The mass society that was characterized by a single, nearly universal consumption standard has evolved into the heterogenous society of the multitude.
The key issues that avant-garde architecture and urbanism should be addressing can be summarized in the slogan: organising and articulating the increased complexity of post-fordist society. The task is to develop an architectural and urban repertoire that is geared up to create complex, polycentric urban and architectural fields which are densely layered and continuously differentiated.

Contemporary avant-garde architecture is addressing the demand for an increased level of articulated complexity by means of retooling its methods on the basis of parametric design systems. The contemporary architectural style that has achieved pervasive hegemony within the contemporary architectural avant-garde can be best understood as a research programme based upon the parametric paradigma. We propose to call this style: Parametricism.
Parametricism is the great new style after modernism. Postmodernism and Deconstructivism have been transitional episodes that ushered in this new, long wave of research and innovation.

Avant-garde styles might be interpreted and evaluated in analogy to new scientific paradigms, affording a new conceptual framework, and formulating new aims, methods and values. Thus a new direction for concerted research work is established.2 My thesis is therefore: Styles are design research programmes.3
Innovation in architecture proceeds via the progression of styles so understood. This implies the alternation between periods of cumulative advancement within a style and revolutionary periods of transition between styles. Styles represent cycles of innovation, gathering the design research efforts into a collective endeavor. Stable self-identity is here as much a necessary precondition of evolution as it is in the case of organic life. To hold on to the new principles in the face of difficulties is crucial for the chance of eventual success. This tenacity  - abundantly evident within the contemporary avant-garde -  might at times appear as dogmatic obstinacy. For instance, the obstinate insistence of solving everything with a folding single surface  - project upon project, slowly wrenching the plausible from the implausible – might be compared to the Newtonian insistence to explain everything from planets to bullets to atoms in terms of the same principles.
“Newton’s theory of gravitation, Einstein’s relativity theory, quantum mechanics, Marxism, Freudianism, are all research programmes, each with a characteristic hard core stubbornly defended, … each with its elaborate problem solving machinery. Each of them, at any stage of its development, has unsolved problems and undigested anomalies. All theories, in this sense, are born refuted and die refuted.”4 The same can be said of styles: Each style has its hard core of principles and a characteristic way of tackling design problems/tasks. Avant-garde architecture produces manifestos: paradigmatic expositions of a new style’s unique potential, not buildings that are balanced to function in all respects. There can be neither verification, nor final refutation merely on the basis of its built results.5 
The programme/style consists of methodological rules: some tell us what paths of research to avoid (negative heuristics), and others what paths to pursue (positive heuristics). The negative heuristics formulates strictures that prevent the relapse into old patterns that are not fully consistent with the core, and the positive heuristics offers guiding principles and preferred techniques that allow the work to fast-forward in one direction. The defining heuristics of parametricism are fully reflected in the taboos and dogmas of contemporary avant-gared design culture:
Negative heuristics: avoid familiar typologies, avoid platonic/hermetic objects, avoid clear-cut zones/territories, avoid repetition, avoid straight lines, avoid right angles, avoid corners, …, and most importantly: do not add or subtract without elaborate interarticulations. 
Positive heuristics: interarticulate, hyberdize, morph, deterritorialize, deform, iterate, use splines, nurbs, generative components, script rather than model, …

Parametricism is a mature style. That the parametric paradigm is becoming pervasive in contemporary architecture and design is evident for quite some time. There has been talk about versioning, iteration and mass customization etc. for quite a while within the architectural avant-garde discourse. 
The fundamental desire that has come to the fore in this tendency had already been formulated at the beginning of the 1990s with the key slogan of “continuous differentiation”6. Since then there has been both a widespread, even hegemonic dissemination of this tendency as well as a cumulative build up of virtuosity, resolution and refinement within it. This development was facilitated by the attendant development of parametric design tools and scripts that allow the precise formulation and execution of intricate correlations between elements and subsystems. The shared concepts, computational techniques, formal repertoires, and tectonic logics that characterize this work are crystallizing into a solid new hegemonic paradigm for architecture. One of the most pervasive current techniques involves populating modulated surfaces with adaptive components.Components might be constructed from multiple elements constrained/cohered by associative relations so that the overall component might sensibly adapt to various local conditions. As they populate a differentiated surface their adaptation should accentuate and amplify this differentiation. This relationship between the base component and its various instantiations at different points of insertion in the “environment” is analogous to the way a single geno-type might produce a differentiated population of pheno-types in response to divers environmental conditions.

The current stage of advancement within parametricism relates as much to the continuous advancement of the attendant computational dresign technologies as it is due to the designer’s realization of the unique formal and organizational opportunities that are afforded. Parametricism can only exist via sophisticated parametric techniques. Finally, computationally advanced design techniques like scripting (in Mel-script or Rhino-script) and parametric modeling (with tools like GC or DP) are becoming a pervasive reality. Today it is impossible to compete within the contemporary avant-garde scene without mastering these techniques. 
Parametricism emerges from the creative exploitation of parametric design systems in view of articulating increasingly complex social processes and institutions. The parametric design tools by themselves cannot account for this drastic stylistic shift from modernism to parametricism. This is evidenced by the fact that late modernist architects are employing parametric tools in ways which result in the maintenance of a modernist aesthetics, i.e. using parametric modelling to inconspicuously absorb complexity. Our parametricist sensibility pushes in the opposite direction and aims for a maximal emphasis on conspicuous differentiation.
It is the sense of organized (law-governed) complexity that assimilates parametricist works to natural systems, where all forms are the result of lawfully interacting forces. Just like natural systems, parametricist compositions are so highly integrated that they cannot be easily decomposed into independent subsystems – a major point of difference in comparison with the modern design paradigm of clear separation of functional subsystems.

The following 5 agendas might be proposed here to inject new aspects into the parametric paradigm and to push the development of parametricism further:
1.Inter-articulation of sub-systems:
The ambition is to move from single system differentiation – e.g. a swarm of façade components - to the scripted association of multiple subsystems – envelope, structure, internal subdivision, navigation void. The differentiation in any one systems is correlated with differentions in the other systems.
2. Parametric Accentuation:
The ambition is to enhance the overall sense of organic integration through intricate correlations that favour deviation amplification rather than compensatory or ameliorating adaptations. For instance, when generative components populate a surface with a subtle curvature modulation the lawful component correlation should accentuate and amplify the initial differentiation. This might include the deliberate setting of accentuating thresholds or singularities. Thus a far richer articulation can be achieved and thus more orienting visual information can be made available. 
3. Parametric Figuration7: 
We propose that complex configurations that are latent with multiple readings can be constructed as a parametric model. The parametric model might be set up so that the variables are extremely Gestalt-sensitive. Parametric variations trigger gestalt-catastrophes, i.e. the quantitative modification of these parameters trigger qualitative shifts in the perceived order of the configuration. This notion of parametric figuration implies an expansion in the types of parameters considered within parametric design. Beyond the usual geometric object parameters, ambient parameters (variable lights) and observer parameters (variable cameras) have to considered and integrated into the parametric system.
4. Parametric Responsiveness8:
We propose that urban and architectural (interior) environments can be designed with an inbuilt kinetic capacity that allows those environments to reconfigure and adapt themselves in response to the prevalent patterns of use and occupation. The real time registration of use-patterns produces the parameters that drive the real time kinetic adaptation process. Cumulative registration of use patterns result in semi-permanent morphological transformations. The built environment acquires responsive agency at different time scales. 
5. Parametric Urbanism9:
The assumption is that the urban massing describes a swarm-formation of many buildings. These buildings form a continuously changing field, whereby lawful continuities cohere this manifold of buildings. Parametric urbanism implies that the systematic modulation of the buildings’ morphologies produces powerful urban effects and facilitates field orientation. Parametric Urbanism might involve parametric accentuation, parametric figuration, and parametric responsivess.

Modernism was founded on the concept of space. Parametricism differentiates fields. Fields are full, as if filled with a fluid medium. We might think of liquids in motion, structured by radiating waves, laminal flows, and spiraling eddies. Swarms have also served as paradigmatic analogues for the field-concept. We would like to think of swarms of buildings that drift across the landscape. Or we might think of large continuous interiors like open office landscapes or big exhibition halls of the kind used for trade fairs. Such interiors are visually infinitely deep and contain various swarms of furniture coalescing with the dynamic swarms of human bodies. There are no platonic, discrete figures with sharp outlines. Within fields only the global and regional field qualities matter: biases, drifts, gradients, and perhaps even conspicuous singularities like radiating centres. Deformation does no longer spell the breakdown of order but the lawful inscription of information. Orientation in a complex, lawfully differentiated field affords navigation along vectors of transformation .The contemporary condition of arriving in a metropolis for the first time, without prior hotel arrangements, without a map, might instigate this kind of field-navigation. Imagine there are no more landmarks to hold on, no axis to follow and no more boundaries to cross. Contemporary architecture aims to construct new logics – the logic of fields – that gear up to organize and articulate the new level of dynamism and complexity of contemporary society.

Furniture and product design fully participates in the parametricist agenda we are pursuing. We consider furniture not in terms of isolated objects but as a pre-eminent space-making substance. Our design efforts need to encompass the domains of interior design, furniture design, and even product design. We can orchestrate all those registers to advance the design of integrated, immersive worlds. Our handling of interior furnishings as dynamic swarm formations, or sometimes as a continuous surface/fluid mass, is geared towards the detailed elaboration of the continuously differentiated fields described above.

NOTES:


1 The Dark Side Club is a critical salon initiated and organized by Robert White to coincide with the Architecture Biennale. Three successive events were onceived as a critical salon to debate some of the themes Aaron Betsky had set for this year’s Biennale. Three curators have been invited to each put forward a proposition for debate: Patrik Schumacher, Greg Lynn, and Gregor Eichinger. Each invited young architects and thinkers to debate the direction architecture is taking.
The first session – curated and introduced by Patrik Schumacher was titled: Parametricism as New Style. The following 8 architectural studios were presenting: MAD, f-u-r, UFO,  Plasma Studio, Minimaforms, Aranda/Lasch, AltN Research+Design, MOH. Jeff Kipnis acted as moderator.
2 This interpretation of styles is valid only with respect to the avant-garde phase of any style.

3 It is important to distinguish between research programmes in the literal sense of institutional research plans from the meta-scientific conception of research programmes that has been introduced into the philosophy of science: whole new research traditions that are directed by a new fundamental theoretical framework. It is this latter concept that is utilized here for the reinterpretation of the concept of style. See: Imre Lakatos, The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes, Cambridge 1978

5 The final reckoning takes place later, in the arena of the mainstream adoption which only indirectly feeds back into the central, discursive arena of the discipline.

PROTOARCHITECTURE

In the post digital age, how we design has become of equal importance as to what we design. Never before have there been so many, or so varied, techniques and methods at our disposal each with the capacity to leap frontiers previously only imagined. Designing has become a liquid discipline pouring into domains for centuries the prime possession of others such as mathematicians, neurologists, geneticists, artists and manufacturers. Post digital designers more often design by manipulation than by singularity, and what is designed has become more curious, intuitive, speculative and experimental. Each of these new techniques vies for dominance amongst the cut throat trenches of advanced tooling. They battle to outdo one another, predict the unpredictable, promise the unattainable, materialize the immaterial, solve all our problems, and so dazzle the beholder that all previous paths to architectural wonderment pale into the archives.

Our new tools are more malleable than before, so much so, that no sooner do they graduate from beta mode than a brighter, fitter or shinier sibling has emerged. As recently as twenty years ago, when I began my architectural education, the methodology of designing buildings had largely remained unchanged in 500 years. Drawings were prepared by hand and evolved from the tentative to the fully costed. Things got built, sometimes in strict accordance to what was drawn, but not always, as records later captured. A few well known but rare individuals such as Pierre Charreau managed it all without such dogmatic trappings, designing his magnificent ‘piece de resistance’ (1927-1931) in collaboration with Bernard Bijvoet and the craftsman Louis Dalbet, largely through conversation and modelling. Before them Gaudi, and later through Prouvé, Price, Eames, and others, pioneering efforts to rethink the verbal properties of design moved us forward but the tools to manage it remained largely the same.

Now we are spoilt for choice, and are frantically catching up with the latest definitions on how the design revolution is to unfold. I describe work from this period as Protoarchitecture. Not a recognised word in any dictionary, it is therefore only part real, and that is how I see the material, part real, part ideal. Protoarchitecture recalls propositions that are prompted by vision rather than convenience. It may be plural or singular, evolutionary or revolutionary, temporary or permanent. It is at once a construct of the physical and the virtual. It does not conform; it is by definition, an exception, a transgression between drawing and making.

Too many people worldwide subsist in undeserving living conditions, and their ranks are growing by the day. As representatives of the professions collectively shaping the built environment, it is our responsibility to resist this intolerable situation. We are speaking out to define an alternative position. We must produce spaces that counter exploitation, control and alienation, whether in urban or rural landscapes. With all our expertise, creativity and power, we need to contribute more dynamically and consequentially to the global quest for equality. Across a range of pilot projects, we have begun to initiate a more humane design culture, working with a robust network of communities, craftsmen, planners, builders and organizations. These alternative practices demand not only further development, but also substantial scaling-up. Guided by a deeper understanding of individual needs and aspirations as our fundamental concern, we must urgently multiply our efforts to improve the ecological, social, and aesthetic quality of the built environment, while developing more effective design strategies to anticipate predicted future growth on a global scale. 

1. Collaborating Eye to Eye We must commit ourselves to respectful communication and cooperation with residents and communities as key partners in achieving positive, measurable change. The impact of a participatory process extends beyond actual design outcomes – it should empower individuals and cultivate a constructive atmosphere with lasting effects. The process should allow sufficient time to facilitate a dialogue striving for respect, curiosity, flexibility and care. 

2. Designing Work Projects must be conceived in a way that creates meaningful work. A thoughtful approach to designing buildings, places, landscapes and products can nurture small-scale enterprises like construction, farming and crafts. By opting for laborbased techniques and non-standardized materials, we can foster a decentralized form of construction and production. Creating an atmosphere of entrepreneurship and innovation is essential in forming value chains connecting local craftsmanship and global industries. New models of selfconstruction for low-income populations must be explored, combining education, training and long-term income generation. The creation of work is foundational for greater equality and peace. 

3. Unfurling Beauty We believe that beauty is an essential human need, linked strongly to dignity. We must strive for an authentic harmony that resonates with people, the genius loci and their territory. The longing for beauty can be stronger than fear and thus a crucial catalyst for humane development. 

4. Identifying the Local Modernization has levelled cultural differences globally and hampered context specific design. Individual projects musst be based on careful observation of geophysical conditions, local building traditions and space hierarchies. Global knowledge on building techniques must be adapted to the local climate, available materials, skill base and energy sources. Site and culturally sensitive design contributes to self-sufficiency and more sustainable local economies. 

5. Understanding the Territory While designers and policy-makers devote significant attention to mega-cities and high density environments, larger agglomerations are deeply dependent on smaller living units and their landscapes. Truly humane design projects understand zones of impact and influence on many scales. They operate between the local, the regional, the continental, and the global, thereby revealing a rich network of dynamic social, economic, and ecological relations that must be respected, adjusted for, and improved as needed. 

6. Educating Designers Designers are not trained sufficiently to achieve positive change for people living in undeserving conditions. Design education has to evolve radically to ensure young designers have the capacity to bridge the gap between design and construction, understand the nuances of diverse sites and territories, and communicate more profoundly with local communities and stakeholders. In short, instil a greater social empathy. Manual skills must be developed on the same footing as digital and intellectual skills. Designing the right process must be equally important as the outcome. 

7. Shaping Policy Integrated infrastructure, new collaborations, and innovative approaches to project development and financing must be translated into a global policy strategy. A vast change is necessary in the way we conceive, distribute and construct human habitats. We must connect top-down and bottom-up processes, with a view to fostering more productive exchanges between residents, policy-makers, financial institutions, the design profession and executing bodies. This will require the mobilization of both human and financial resources. We need broader and better solutions, at a lower cost, for a larger number of people. 
These principles provide necessary impetus for a radical reorientation of all professional design disciplines. It is critical to shift current self-perceptions from topdown planning to transparent cooperation throughout the cycle of planning, design, construction and usage. Design imagination is our primary instrument to define how we want our world to be.

Code is a mutating and varied body of tools that allow for the production of entire digital environments. As such, informing oneself of its possibilities and platforms is necessary for the future production of digital design.",,,EN,,,,"<a href=""http://dcrit.sva.edu/"">http://dcrit.sva.edu/</a>",,,<a>http://dcrit.sva.edu/view/readingroom/a-manifesto-for-postindustrial-design/</a>,"Digital Design, Digital Architecture, Code","A Manifesto for Postindustrial Design

Mass production, as we know it, will soon be extinct. So say goodbye to heavy metals, huge warehouses, and durable goods. And say hello to the bearable lightness of living networks, metabolism, and code.

A new kind of design practice is emerging against the background of our own shifting cultural landscape. Information and code have become the basis for understanding life, and the old, mechanistic models—drawn in part from the Industrial Revolution—have fallen away. Code (genetic and digital) has emerged as the reality common to all things material and immaterial. Code levels difference, uniting things as surface variations that are built upon different, deeper combinations of code. Sacred oppositions such as human and machine, mind and computer, matter and information, real and virtual, and natural and artificial no longer seem so absolute in our dreamworld of transgenic species, prosthetic intelligence, augmented reality, and DNA computers. And what makes code so revolutionary is that it has no essential form. It can be changed at will. Cut, paste, remove, save, find, replace, blend, insert, save as. Life is a file to be manipulated with Photoshop ease and flexibility. And you can always move back in time. Just undo it.

In this primordial ooze of mutating code, the industrial mode of production is just a rotting old carcass, decomposing but still taking up space. Originally, as a professional practice, industrial design was built upon a sturdy foundation of manufacturing cycles, business needs, tooling costs, central distribution networks, planned obsolescence, and seemingly abundant natural and synthetic resources. These conditions, simply put, are no longer relevant. We operate within a technological, economic, and cultural infrastructure that has long moved on from its industrial base. Industrial culture needs to be obsolete not because it is evil, immoral, profligate, toxic, or gluttonous (though it is many of those things), but because it no longer reflects the facts on the ground. It can no longer keep up in a world of light speed and versioning. Its byproducts are too slow, too permanent, and take up too much space. Ironically, industrial design, the engine of planned obsolescence, is now obsolete. For where we used to produce durable goods—which weren’t really that durable after all, except in our landfills—we will now circulate code, capacity, and connections.

It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see that we live in an information and service economy, not a manufacturing economy. We see the impact of these changes not only in the ravage and rot of former industrial cities but also in the rhizomatic boom in edge-city development and sprawl (where more than three-quarters of all office space currently exists). But just acknowledging that we live in a service and information-based economy doesn’t capture the peculiar characteristics of postindustrial culture. Postindustrial design is a qualitatively different way of designing in this new culture. Three things are propelling this revolution: distributed intelligence, computer-aided design and manufacture, and ecological realities. The result is that designers will no longer dictate form from the system’s center and then foist their wares upon a passive marketplace. Instead, more and more design will be a code and a set of parameters. That code will then be let loose in an electronic ecosystem so that it can be manipulated, changed, improved, hacked, and produced in multiple variations in myriad places.

These new processes of design are more biological than mechanical.  They are flexible, adaptable, sustainable, and self-organizing. The “design” will gain energy and vitality through this distribution and circulation, just as genes do. Code, too, has its own characteristics, traits, patterns, and needs. It has metabolism. It survives through modified loops of input, stimulation, feedback, circulation, and change. Sprawling networks of data that are ubiquitous, immediate, and infinite will amplify and distribute that code.  In this way, code becomes dynamic; it is alive to its environment. The old order of vertical integration and of centers and peripheries is giving way to flux and code, mutability and drift. Out with hard goods. In with soft wares.

Incubating within this new design mode are different dynamics of market research, design, manufacture, distribution, and ownership. We saw it first in information technologies, but it is now seeping into the product design world as well. This model is closer to the open-source mode of software creation than to the romantic, genius-in-a-tower version. How does this matrix of connectedness and code-shifting change our understanding of a design process? It affects every aspect of every step of the process.  We are not simply upgrading the familiar.  Postindustrial design is as different from the artisanal mode of production that it supplanted. No longer will companies rely upon imprecise statistical models and historical projections to determine the quantity and qualities of the things they make. There is too much wasted motion in even the most precise and efficient of these production models. While economies of scale and task specialization created unimaginable abundance, the industrial manufacturing process is beset with a top-down, top-heavy, centralization distribution system.  It is inherently bloated, conservative, and risk-averse.

Two precedents from outside industrial design illustrate this evolution clearly. Netscape used to sell its Web browser. That made sense, since it developed the technology, wrote the code, burned the discs, distributed the packages in trucks to stores, and cleared a margin of profit by the end. But the company fast discovered that the best way to stay competitive was to give away the product for free.  Linux emerged because a connected group of interests coalesced into an idea that took form only through the participation of multiple creators. While Linus Torvald gets credited with the initial genesis, the current versions of Linux bear little trace of his handiwork. He and others established guidelines for its evolution and let it loose on its native network. Even more remarkable, no one really owns it. It comes with a constitution of sorts, but that is it. Private companies can “sell” it, but all they really sell is support and documentation. They must make the operating system itself available for free. So this is the Linux story: No one entity created it; no one owns it; there is an infinite variety of possible versions; it is rapidly evolving; it has no final state. And it is challenging Windows. Who could have focus-tested Linux? Because its source code is open and free to all, there is barely even one static thing called Linux.  Compare its birth process to the love-it-or-leave-it, straining and grunting, cloak-and-dagger ploys of its competitors, and you being to see the daring lightness of its promise.

While there is not one single product that embodies this new process completely, we can look to a range of phenomena that, like Linux, carry the future code within their genetic makeup. The examples that follow all turn conventional development processes inside out, shaking out waste, stasis, inertia, and a lot of rust.

Front Design
Front Design, from Sweden, explores the boundaries between natural and artificial processes of product development, creating strange and wonderful hybrids that erase the designer’s hand in the creation of a final form (See I.D., September/October 2004, p. 57). Front’s attic Animals project leaves design to the whims of a variety of common animal species: rodents chew/design Rat Wallpaper’s holey pattern; a housefly’s path around a light bulb—digitally traced—forms the structure for a lamp shade. The group simply sets up the process and lets nature take its course.  In its Design By projects, it cedes control to accidental processes and perturbations. The objects in the Scanner series result from capture errors as a 3-D scanner misreads an original object and then a 3-D printer compounds the misreading in a cloned, by dysmorphic, reinterpretation.  At the intersection of biological randomness and technological freakishness, Front subverts design authorship.  Form mutates, emerging polymorphously from processes gone out of control.

Interface Carpet
Interface Carpet has taken at face value the unglamorous fact that we are a service-based economy and used that to redefine its business, its mission, its environmental impact, and its product. The company no longer sells carpet; it offers the service of floor coverage.  The product vanishes. Waste, too, is gone from the system. Interface has closed the loop on its production cycle, meaning that it uses fewer resources, takes back everything it possibly can, traffics in long-term relationships instead of depreciating products, and feeds off the waste it produces. Like an organism, its metabolism is optimized to balance input and output and to produce nothing that cannot be consumed by someone or something else. Interface designs for disassembly and operates by the principle that waste is a waste. It also challenges the assumption that we are inherently acquisitive and proprietary and careless. In the end, who really wants to own flooring—or a heating system, a fax machine, a refrigerator, an air-conditioner—only to throw it away five to ten years down the road? Interface, and other companies (like Electrolux and even Ford), is watching the commodity model of product development vanish in its rearview mirror. Its product-as-service model assumes you want to have regular, optimal performance and don’t care much about owning the thing itself. It is closer to leasing than owning. What the company banks on, in the end, is that what it provides will last and satisfy. Interface is selling a relationship, not a product unit. What it sells can shape-shift, evolve, fold back into its production cycle, and return again as brand-new. Like nature, this living system model relies upon connection, input, feedback, and dynamic response. Sure, there will always bee some stuff that people will want to own for its full lifespan (underwear comes to mind), but down the road it will be more luxurious to be free from stuff—and lightweight, mobile, aware, and connected—than to be making monthly pilgrimages to the local U-Store-It facility.

Open/Future
Two exciting experiments in product development—Ronen Kadushin’s Open Design and FutureFactories’ Tuber and Tuber9 lights—operate on the premise that the next phase of design will be open and distributed. Like good source code, each designer crafts a robust CAD file, then releases it into an electronic medium for adaptation, modification, hacking, and further evolution.  The designer creates a template or platform for design possibilities, but the final form is now in the hands of the consumer. The key to this process is that computer-aided and robotic manufacturing systems are allowing almost infinite variate in any production run.  Mass-producing singularities was an oxymoron; it is no longer. Nor is the designer or manufacturer constrained by conventional hefty costs of idle product inventory, retail overhead, seasonal change, constant retooling, and on down the line.  Combine the flexibility of design-on-demand with the advances (and likely democratization) of stereolithography and 3-D printing, and suddenly desktop product design is a freaky reality, not a sci-fi fantasy.

These projects illuminate strikingly different approaches.  Postindustrial design is not even one thing yet, but multiple, heterogeneous strains that are destabilizing the industrial mode of production.  Between them, one can glimpse four characteristics in common, and from that, the outlines of something starkly new.

Formless
Which Tuber9 light will design magazines profile for their award galleries? Who knows? There is no one archetype that represents the product totally. We don’t even have the capacity—or the visual language—to create a totalized vision of this kind of product line. Products will shape-shift internally to the point that we can only celebrate the system of their creation, not the thing itself.  The idea of creating brand-identity through product family resemblance, with all the top-down control that that implies, is antiquated.  The product as a singularity, an immutable object, will cease to exert its charms. We will no longer design things that cannot be changed at will, by whomever, by any point in the process. Design will evolve from a process of turning natural resources into static shapes into one of distributing codes to be constantly rematerialized.

Free
It is not that the products of postindustrial design will cost nothing, but that they will be “let loose” on networks to find and optimize their potential.  They are at the pull of the consumer, not the push of heavy industry.  The outputs will be right-sized by the very fact that they will not be created as one-size-fits-all, but customized to the user’s idiosyncrasies. Software, soft tooling, robotic manufacturing, and smart databases will draw participation and variation into the old, clandestine fabrication process. Animated by the intelligence of thriving networks of collaborative possibility, designs will also get optimized in the infinitely iterative process of their distributed creation.

Metabolic
The stunning promise of postindustrial design is that it can leave a lighter, more vaporous footprint. Look at the poisoned landscapes of Philadelphia and Detroit and you can see the true cost of industrial production. Fatuous and fat, it belched out standardized goods and invisible pollution, producing mass conformity, hyperconsumption, and a disposable society.  We can no longer afford that hypocrisy and blindness. We still need stuff, but postindustrial design has the advantage of hindsight, working in the shadow of industrial design’s legacy.  Design and production that are sentient, aware, adaptive, and able to live off their own or others’ waste will not only be powerfully efficient, they will be environmentally, culturally, and fiscally sustainable. They will smartly adapt their input and output and thrive within the local—and global—bounds  of their ecology.

Decentralized
The tools are in your hands, if you want them. This will not be true of all products, but imagine the possibility of creating design solutions appropriate to you or your family neighborhood, or tribe. One size doesn’t fit all, and not all design intelligence resides in the center. Distributing the power to create is a plan than nature has used with spectacular success. Staggering flexibility and adaptability comes from distributing capacity out from the center. So new kinds of products, companies, and brands—labile, fluid, and protean—will challenge the hegemony of the global superbrands. And who wants a transnational, focus-tested, homogeneous megacorporation to design their stuff anyway?

Postindustrial design embodies the potential to create and produce differently, and not to repeat the mistakes we didn’t always know we were making. The role of business and the designer in this context will be to enable possibility, provide vision, and set parameters to optimize the system. That means that designers will be working with new and unfamiliar tools in strange and unlikely places. The industrial colossus is not going to collapse right away. It has provided functional, safe, beautiful, and even sublime things. But the model is extinct. Evolutions and mutations are mostly breeding outside industrial design for now—in fashion, architecture, engineering, software, the Web—but their seeds are implanting themselves in the cracks of the industrial foundation. And with that, new species of products will soon emerge.",<em>A Manifesto for Postindustrial Design</em>,,,,2014-08-10T20:34:36+00:00,10,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/10,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=80,80,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T14:13:36+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Digital Architecture, Digital Design",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/80

The developers, immortals or gods hereafter known as the devs shall create and maintain a gaming environment that strives for class balance where all player classes of the same level are equal in power and utility with each other.
At character creation players will be given complete and full disclosure of the devs intended role and vision for that class during all phases of that classes lifespan.
Each class shall have a well-defined primary role and be instilled with a meaningful purpose to fulfill within the gaming environment.
Each class shall be created with abilities and characteristics that are uniquely their own despite the fact that they may share primary and secondary roles with other classes.
Each class shall perform their primary role with equally efficacy and efficiency whether solo, in groups or in raids throughout the career of the player regardless of level.
Each class shall have optional secondary roles which will allow them to partially take on the duties of another classes primary role if the need arises.
No class shall be subject to experience penalties in order to compensate for the increased class utility of secondary abilities.
Each class will have an official design document made available to the playerbase to ensure future consistency of the devs vision for each class regardless of changes to the dev team whether philosophical or personnel in nature.
To ensure that each class has a future and remains viable throughout the life of the game, the powers and abilities of each class shall increase equally at regular intervals in accordance with that class’s primary role as defined in the official design document.
Each class must be allowed to flourish and grow by allowing reasonable freedom to self-determination in ways unimagined by the devs.
Content will be designed so that the worth and unique abilities of each class will be fully desired, appreciated and utilized whether solo, in groups or in raid settings.
When there are more then one of a certain class in a group or raid, the devs must ensure that the abilities and contributions of that class must be accumulate and provide an aggregate benefit.
No class shall exist that is absolutely required for success in defeating encounters whether in groups or in raids.
No player shall be penalized by unfair game mechanics for choosing to play one class over another.
The devs will strive to maintain a gaming environment that promotes class diversity and group synergy where each class is equally desired and represented by the player demographics.
The devs shall release accurate class demographic information to the player community on a regular and timely basis.
The devs must routinely solicit input from a wide spectrum of each of the player class communities regarding issues and suggestions that relate to class balance and engage in respectful and responsive dialog treating all classes in a fair and equitable manner.
When changes to a class are deemed absolutely necessary the devs will communicate these proposed changes in an honest and open manner giving reasonable time for the playerbase to comment.
To further the goals of class balance the total power of a class will be a reasonable and fair combination of the following:
1) inherent class abilities accumulated through tasks and character advancement
2) potential itemization accumulated through tasks and character advancement
3) individual player skill

I have edited and extended his list slightly, without altering its spirit, to obtain the following, which may serve as a reasonable preface to this Manifesto:

Ten Cosmist Convictions

1) Humans will merge with technology, to a rapidly increasing extent. This is a new phase of the evolution of our species, just picking up speed about now. The divide between natural and artificial will blur, then disappear. Some of us will continue to be humans, but with a radically expanded and always growing range of available options, and radically increased diversity and complexity. Others will grow into new forms of intelligence far beyond the human domain.

2) We will develop sentient AI and mind uploading technology. Mind uploading technology will permit an indefinite lifespan to those who choose to leave biology behind and upload. Some uploaded humans will choose to merge with each other and with AIs. This will require reformulations of current notions of self, but we will be able to cope.

3) We will spread to the stars and roam the universe. We will meet and merge with other species out there. We may roam to other dimensions of existence as well, beyond the ones of which we're currently aware.

4) We will develop interoperable synthetic realities (virtual worlds) able to support sentience. Some uploads will choose to live in virtual worlds. The divide between physical and synthetic realities will blur, then disappear.

5) We will develop spacetime engineering and scientific ""future magic"" much beyond our current understanding and imagination.

6) Spacetime engineering and future magic will permit achieving, by scientific means, most of the promises of religions -- and many amazing things that no human religion ever dreamed. Eventually we will be able to resurrect the dead by ""copying them to the future"".

7) Intelligent life will become the main factor in the evolution of the cosmos, and steer it toward an intended path.

8) Radical technological advances will reduce material scarcity drastically, so that abundances of wealth, growth and experience will be available to all minds who so desire. New systems of self-regulation will emerge to mitigate the possibility of mind-creation running amok and exhausting the ample resources of the cosmos.

9) New ethical systems will emerge, based on principles including the spread of joy, growth and freedom through the universe, as well as new principles we cannot yet imagine

10) All these changes will fundamentally improve the subjective and social experience of humans and our creations and successors, leading to states of individual and shared awareness possessing depth, breadth and wonder far beyond that accessible to ""legacy humans""


P.S.
Giulio made the following comment on the use of the word ""will"" in the above principles:

STATEMENT OF INTENT REGARDING THE PRODUCTION OF DIGITAL AND INTERACTIVE WORKS IN QUEBEC

In the realm of digital creation and production, the whole world has their eyes on Quebec, yet there is no tangible support currently in place to develop and grow these new writing practices. On the 15th of November 2013, the Groupe de travail sur les enjeux du cinéma québécois (GTEC) submitted their report on the future of cinema to the Minister of Culture, without significant mention of digital creation.

We are an informal group of creators, producers and broadcasters who were invited to participate to the consultation process. We believe that digital creation is a cultural industry in its own right, and that it should be part of our cultural landscape alongside its more traditional domains. In order to have a local, sustainable and global impact, we need to support new forms of storytelling now.

1 Quebec is currently a world leader in interactive creation.

2 No man is a prophet in his own land. The people of Quebec are unaware that our artists and producers are changing the face of the digital world globally. First and foremost, we wish to design for the people and the culture of Quebec.

3 Interactive work is not a derivative of any other form of expression. It is an art form in itself. We must define the practice and support it through a unique process tailored to its needs and character.

4 The industry of interactivity is a cultural industry. Its creators are not service providers. It is only through applied support that a culture of authors will emerge.

5 Producing interactive projects involves prototyping artistic and technological ideas. Code and programming are tools of this expression.

6 It is necessary to create favorable conditions for the emergence of an interactive writing culture.

7 The means of distribution constitute part of the creative act.

8 Digital content has already outgrown the screen. The platform for its curation and distribution has not yet seen the light of day.

9 Quebec's interactive works must be properly preserved so that future digital creators might know that they form part of a cultural lineage and history.

10 In order to maintain its global leadership in creating interactive work, Quebec has to set up a dedicated and sustainable support system for artists and companies working in the creation of digital and interactive work. This support must address both development and production phases.

Manifesto on Digital Scholarship at Liberal Arts Colleges

Librarians and technologists at liberal arts colleges are well-positioned to create and collaborate on generative digital scholarship. Our colleges benefit from several strengths: close working relationships among faculty, students, librarians, and technologists; a history of faculty-student collaboration; limited systems legacy; and fewer administrative layers. The small size of our individual schools may limit technical capacity in some areas, but we will share successes and challenges, emphasize openness and collaboration, and ensure that the community, as a whole, advances together. As librarians and technologists engaged in digital scholarship at liberal arts institutions, we are committed to these principles:

Our work is driven by scholarly questions and aided by technology. Not the other way around.

Digital research that produces generative scholarship, and which leads to new data, interpretations, and questions even as projects are being developed and used, creates especially rich opportunities for learning and teaching in liberal arts colleges.

Digital scholarship, with its opportunity for multidisciplinarity, meaningful collaboration, and focus on productive experimentation and exploration can embody what is richest in the liberal arts environment.

Developing students as research partners and project collaborators is central to our mission, and should be pursued wherever possible.

Central to a strong digital scholarship program is investment in management, preservation, and access to digital assets.

To encourage sustainable development as well as free and open use and reuse of scholarly materials, we promote Open Access to scholarship, Open source software development, open metadata, and reusable data.

Undergraduate “Manifesto” on Digital Humanities

The Manifesto

We are a group of fourteen undergraduate students at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania, enrolled in an Honors course – Introduction to Digital Humanities. As our final, in fitting with the themes that we have studied, we have been inspired (and, thankfully, allowed and encouraged) to draft, for the 4Humanities project, a manifesto. [See explanation of context for this manifesto on 4Humanities site.]

DH Has Changed Us

We believe that teaching Digital Humanities to undergraduate students is critically important. Today’s college undergrads are part of a unique, new generation. We have been immersed in this new climate every day, surrounded by the digitization of the world, and yet most students probably know very little about the actual study of Digital Humanities.

So little is being done to truly integrate technology into new pedagogical practices. Teaching Digital Humanities to undergrads can be beneficial because it gives insight not only into the humanities but also into how the onset of technology has changed our world, and how we can change with it. Though learning Digital Humanities does not need, as a goal, to turn its students into scholars, it can prompt them to make their work a little more worthwhile.

The study of humanities is an art form, and if this is not passed on to the next generation, using the new tools that we are accustomed to and can use easily, the art form will be lost. As one of the few undergraduate DH classes, we feel that all undergraduates need to have a chance to experience this and to show the DH community the substantial contributions that we can make. Teaching DH to undergraduate students opens up a world of innovation that will enhance the study of the humanities.

Undergraduates should be learning about DH
How could Digital Humanities have evaded us, the digital natives, after two decades of immersing ourselves in not only the humanities, but also technology? Why is the body of work that defines digital humanities made up of pieces written by individuals who are immigrants to this age? We appreciate and respect immigrants’ contributions, but natives bring a critical new perspective – we need to be prepared to take over.

Mark Bauerlein argues that “[Digital immigrants] want [us] to grow up and to blow [them] away […] but [they] just don’t see it happening” (see video from the PBS special, Digital Nation). In the chapter “Screen Time” from his book, The Dumbest Generation, Bauerlein further asserts that much of our time spent with digital media is more of an idle activity than a mind-expanding one. We’ve read and heard enough statistics this semester to know that he’s not just making this up. But what exactly are we doing wrong?

We’d like to argue that we haven’t done anything wrong; we’ve simply been misguided.

Technology can both inhibit and facilitate the learning process for undergraduates. It can serve as a tool for intellectual assignments or as a distraction; the latter of which gave us the title “Dumbest Generation.” If we, the digital natives, don’t want this designation, we need to harness this shift in our learning styles and knowledge. We need to show the digital immigrants that “our way” cannot be compared with the “old way” — it’s simply different.

As a class, DH opened our eyes to these implications of technology. This course exposed us to the effects of the digital world in each of our lives and society in general. We have learned that we are not less intelligent, but that we use knowledge and learn information differently than digital immigrants.

We need a different kind of education…
Today, we need collaboration, not lectures; we need to learn concepts, not singular facts; we need networking and socialization, not isolation; we need interactive learning, not to sit back and listen. We need new outcome objectives, not standardized tests. The immigrants ultimately need to accept this change, for the digital natives are fundamentally different.

…and the Humanities needs interdisciplinary collaboration
Because it’s different for everyone. The science major approaches things differently than the literature major — this diversity is foundational to Digital Humanities.

The literary scholar will tell you what Howl means; the historian will give you context on the sociopolitical climate of the time; the chemist will test for drug residue on the original manuscripts; the computer scientist will create a Java-enhanced website; all of them will transcribe those manuscripts in TEI-XML; and none of this will be done alone.

Through our Digital Humanities experience, we’ve learned that Humanities is interdisciplinary and collaborative. To quote our About page: “In this course we’ll explore some of the new ways humanists are bridging the cultural divide by applying technologically-driven methods within the humanities.” Rather than fussing over a definition of DH, why not kick back and embrace its multifarious nature?

Conclusion
It is baffling why the concepts of DH are not being taught more broadly at the undergraduate level. Digital Humanities is about not only learning and accepting the digital ways of our world, but also about how to apply these strategies to our education. From our DH class, we found that DH isn’t easy to pin down/put a label on. It’s not a fact or a definition one can memorize. It’s not something that can be understood in 5 minutes- or even 5 weeks. It’s something that is on a completely different level than any other subject or idea. It’s real. It’s relatable. It’s understandable. It’s intellectual. It’s sophisticated. It’s essential.

If we could take all of these thoughts and ideas from a course we were so unsure of in the beginning, imagine what college students in the future could contribute.

Towards a DJ manifesto

Bizarrely (to those of us focussed on online development, anyway) we often find that new journalists join us with much the same bias towards print journalism as many of the ""old school"".

It led a gang of us to wonder whether when recruiting new talent we should start advertising all journalist roles as ""digital journalists"". Although most people work across print and online here, the ""digital"" prefix might help to shift perceptions for new recruits and, indeed, for recruiters.

That led us naturally to suppose we had better start writing down ideas about what a digital journalist is and does (or at least will be and will do).

Clearly ""digital"" need not alter everything involved in journalism - news values and skills are arguably mostly untouched (truth, the ability to tell a story, interviewing skills and so on).

But I've been dwelling on how a digital journalist might reasonably be distinguished from a traditional journalist.

So here - without further ado - is my first draft Digital Journalism Manifesto:

the digital journalist can distinguish which elements of a story are best told through which media - words, pictures, video, audio, charts

the digital beat-journalist participates in his or her beat community through forums, blogs, microblogging etc.

the digital journalist uses tools such as RSS feeds to monitor emerging news

the digital journalist may also use tools such as RSS feeds to share emerging news with other people

the digital journalist is not afraid to link to other people's websites

the digital journalist's instinct is to publish news as soon as it happens, not to sit on it to fill next week's front page.

the digital journalist has a duty to provide good user experience to his/her readers by linking to further information.

the digital journalist can touch type (ha ha ha), take a half-decent digital photograph and point and shoot a video camera if required.

the digital journalist never goes anywhere without a laptop (or some means of submitting material)

the digital journalist knows how to find wi-fi hotspots

the digital journalist willingly (and legally) embeds other people's content (e.g. YouTube videos, Flickr photos, other suitable licensed Creative Commons materials) into his/her story

the digital journalist happily joins in online conversations resulting from his/her article

the digital journalist can use a range of web tools (including microblogging and social media) to develop stories.

the digital journalist can probably cobble a half decent video together and upload it

the digital journalist (often publishing without the safety net of sub-editors and editors) has an excellent knowledge of media law (especially libel)

the digital journalist (often publishing without the safety net of sub-editors and editors) can spell (or use a spell checker) and string a sentence together

the digital journalist almost certainly has at least one professional blog

Goodness knows what the union would say. I hasten to add that these are just personal thoughts off the top of my head and all completely unofficial.

“Find something you’re passionate about. Make a career doing what you love and you’ll never work a day in your life.”

OK- That may not be the exact quote, but we’ve all heard it before. Maybe it was said by your parents when you were growing up, begging you to stick it out in college because they wished they had. Maybe it was said by that odd-smelling philosophy professor in college who really loved what he did.

A journalism professor once said that to me. Of course, my passion changed more frequently than a Google Doodle. One day it was politics, another day it was sports, and the next it was craft beer and micro-breweries. One thing remained constant, though. Through all of the changes in my interests and passions, the one thing I wanted to do was create digital content, manage a website to showcase this content, and develop/execute a strategy to disseminate this content through cyber space. I am so fortunate to be able to do what I’m passionate about every day.

That’s one of the things I think is missing in journalism today – passion. There is far too much complacency and indifference. Readers want to know what is going on right now, not tomorrow morning. Our job as journalists is to get relevant and important information to the reader as accurately as we possibly can and as soon as we possibly can. When news breaks, journalists have the duty and privilege to act as the intermediary between the readers and the information they need. That’s an incredible responsibility.

Journalists today have such a powerful arsenal of digital tools to get this information out to the public instantly that it would make William Randolph Hearst’s head spin. Think about it. You can reach a reader by Tweet, Facebook post, email blast, or push notification from a smart phone application without he or she even looking for your news content in the first place. The words you write, the content you put together, can be shared from reader to reader so much that you could become internationally known overnight.

We live in the age of truly developing news stories, of instant instant-updates, of the 24-hour news cycle. Readers can see a story unfold from scanner chatter to it’s final destination – right before their eyes, on Twitter. A journalist can be the vessel through which readers are warned, informed, and educated – no matter where in the world his or her desk is in comparison to them.

It doesn’t matter the size of your staff or the size of your print circulation – you can still reach millions of people from all over the world with your content if it’s worth consuming. There are no borders, no limits in the digital space. There are no margins.

It’s amazing what we can do as journalists today, and it’s even more amazing that so many members of this prestigious profession have not embraced the digital benefits at their fingertips. These journalists, newspapermen, feel secure in what they know, trust in what is familiar. But isn’t it the job of the journalist to go out and see what other stories are out there to be told? To dig deeper, go farther, go further, and deliver the most complete story possible?

There’s a change in the media landscape coming. It’s already started, and is picking up speed with each click, each +1, each Like, and each Tweet. The digital revolution is upon us and to determine what side you belong on, ask yourself these questions:

Why wouldn’t I want to be the first to report this news on Twitter for my readers? Why wouldn’t I want to be the first one to share a photo of this event with my readers? Why wouldn’t I want to shoot first-hand video of this tragedy to show my readers another angle of this story? Why wouldn’t I want to be the most complete journalist I can be, with the tools given to me, to better my craft with each piece of content I produce?",<em>The Digital Journalism Manifesto</em>,,,,2014-08-12T00:07:00+00:00,3,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/3,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=87,87,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T14:10:05+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Digital Composition, Digital Journalism",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/87

Fucked up on my computer and my mind starts roaming
I create like a heathen
The first cycles of this virus I can send through a modem
Infiltration hits your station
No microsoft or enhanced dos will impede

Bingo! harddrive crashes from the rendering
Alot of hackers tryed virus's before
Vaporize your text like so much white out
I want it where a file replication is a chore
Lights out shut down the entire whitehouse
I dont want just a bug that could be corrected
Im erecting immaculate design
Break the nation down section by section
Even to the greatest minds its impossible to find

trash your whole computer system and revert you to papyrus

I want to develop a super virus

Better by far then that old y 2 k
This 3030 the time of global unification break right through they

Slaves to silicon
Curupt politicians with leaders and thier keywords
F.B.I and spys stealin bombs
Decipitate thier plans in thier face and catch the fever
Everybody loot the stores get your caned goods
Even space stations are having a hard time
Beast keeepers seek to take our manhood
Which results in the form of global aparthied
Ghettos are trash dumps with gas pumps
Exploding and burnt out since before the great union
The last punks walk around like masked monks
Ready to manipulate the data base and break through em
Human rights come in a hudreth place
Mass production has always been number one
New Earth has become a repungnent place
So its time to spread the fear and the thunder some

This piece was supposed to be about porn star James Deen.

After reading about Deen here and there and everywhere, I had the idea that perhaps there was something worth writing about. Only the problem was, that the more I watched of his work, the less I had a desire to write about it. Perhaps the point is not Deen himself and how he has been lauded via the wheel of favorable ratings by female audiences online. What needs to be written about is what happens when a woman sits down and engages with sex—specifically, her own, as tied to an exploration of her individual sexuality and liberation therein—via the medium of a computer screen.

There are only so many Deen videos a girl can watch with the goal of “critique” at the forefront: at a certain point, one of two things irrupts that process. The first is a screen, stuck, overwhelmed as a consequence of having too many windows open, too many things playing at once; I am trying to get an education, make a determination for myself, so I want to see everything, hear everything, right now, all at once. The second irruption I will leave for you to guess at. I will hint at the latter by saying that a petite morte of the physical self can be easily mirrored in the metaphor of the digital “glitch”—a little digital death, a wheeze, a shift, a breath, a sneeze, a pause. A glitch. I am writing from there: the glitch. The moment of one’s participation in sexual activity online where the myth of AFK (“Away From Keyboard”) and IRL (“In Real Life”) that comprise the two sides of Jurgenson’s digital dualism duality collapse, and, in the collapse, realize their dazzling potential.

In Chris Baraniuk’s “Feedback, White Noise and Glitches: Cyberspace Strikes Back”, Baraniuk observes, “Glitches, feedback, whitenoise, interference, static—although these may not be the final frontier, they are demonstrably—for now—the edge,” further noting that, “. . . glitches . . . remind us that what we see on a screen is subject to a special kind of entropy which does not exist in the physical world . . . ” When faced with this sort of interruption we opt to make physical with ourselves, our partners, the world around us, that which, without this pause, we might not feel the urgency to manifest for ourselves, with ourselves.

The glitch is the digital orgasm, where the machine takes a sigh, a shudder, and with a jerk, spasms. These moments have been integrated into the rituals and routines of our own physical action, impacting how we interact with our own bodies, and how we explore our deepest fantasies and desires, spurred forth by these mechanized micro-seizures. The glitch is the catalyst, not the error. The glitch is the happy accident. When the computer freezes mid-conversation, when the video buffers and refuses to progress, these moments are a new mode of foreplay, something that needs to be acknowledged not as a fetish, but as a new possibly for foreplay within sexual routine. We want what we cannot have; whatever the material we are aiming to access, the glitch makes us wait and whimper for it.

Digital dualism’s IRL is juxtaposed with AFK, a falsehood, for sure—the rapidly waning notion that there are somehow two selves, operating in isolation from one another, rather than one continuous self, two sides of a vivacious equation looped together in a continual narrative of daily living and human existence. The glitch splits the difference; it is a plank that passes between the two. When watching media online, it is the rainbowed spinning wheel, the pixilated hiccup, the frozen screen, or the buffering signal that acts as a fissure, that jars us into recognition of the separation of our physical selves from the body that immerses itself in fantasy when participating in sexual activity online. Yet, simultaneously, it is also the glitch that prompts us to “choose-our-own-adventure”, to finish the story, and, in doing so, to acknowledge that when the mediation of digital space fails us, albeit briefly, we continue right where we left off, taking the revolution offline, but not out of body, thereby demonstrating the fallacy of the digital dualist dialectic. Will we reboot? restart? Perhaps. Ultimately, we will polish things off, just as we see fit, and to put a bow on the end goal of jouissance—ribboned and righted, and, because we want it, we will seize our release.

I am writing about “sexual activity” broadly, an overarching umbrella: I am talking about the watching of porn, but also about cybering, sexting, G-chat fantasy play, or the uploading or downloading of other sex-oriented content from the Internet. It is the glitch that incites anticipation—that ecstasy of interference. An immersive différence, in the purest sense of the French translation—both “difference” and “defer” alike. Though pejoratively dismissed all too frequently as an aspect of technical error, for me the glitch denotes an extension of the realm of foreplay, whether it be “play” with oneself, or with a virtualized other, imagined, or waiting just on the other side of the proverbial screen.

With this in mind, I propose the turning of a new radicality, coining the term “Glitch Feminism” to make use of here in these pages for the first time, by my hand, which on this journey has found its home both on the keys and between my legs, equally.

It must be noted that the word glitch is oft delegated to the realm of slang, which explains why it is so easy to pin it with negative connotations. Urban Dictionary defines it as “an error in a structured system”; Dictionary.com defines it as “a defect or malfunction in a machine or plan”. In a society that conditions the public to find discomfort or outright fear in the errors and malfunctions of our socio-cultural mechanics—illicitly and implicitly encouraging an ethos of “Don’t rock the boat!”—a “glitch” becomes an apt metonym. Glitch Feminism, however, embraces the causality of “error”, and turns the gloomy implication of glitch on its ear by acknowledging that an error in a social system that has already been disturbed by economic, racial, social, sexual, and cultural stratification and the imperialist wrecking-ball of globalization—processes that continue to enact violence on all bodies—may not, in fact, be an error at all, but rather a much-needed erratum. This glitch is a correction to the “machine”, and, in turn, a positive departure. This glitch I speak of here calls for a breaking from the hegemony of a “structured system” infused with the pomp and circumstance of patriarchy, one that for all too long has marginalized female-identified bodies, and continues to offend our sensibilities by giving us only a piece of the pie and assuming our satisfaction. We want to claim for ourselves permanent seats at the table, an empowered means of demarcating space that can be possessed by us in entirety, a veritable “room of [our] own” that, despite the strides made via feminist political action, has yet to truly belong to us.

A Glitch Feminist acknowledges the value of visuality, and the revolutionary role that digital practice has in expanding the construction, deconstruction, and re-presentation of the female-identifying corpus. We acknowledge that the rigidity of digital dualism needs to be retired, as it plays into binaries of real/virtual that parallel the rampantly socialized figuration of male/female.

“Glitch” is conjectured as finding its etymological roots in the Yiddish glitch (“slippery area”) or perhaps German glitschen (“to slip, slide”); it is this slip and slide that the glitch makes plausible, a swim in the liminal, a trans-formation, across selfdoms. The digital divide, as with the gender divide, is a construct that allows for phallogocentrism, normative systems oriented toward the necessary splitting of selves, to stick, having lulled us into consenting to their naturalizing neutrality, despite the stark reality that such structures are not in actuality “neutral”, nor natural, in any capacity. As bodies, we are an extended narrative, eternal in our geographies, imbued with unexpected fissures that cause us to re-present ourselves, and, in doing so, see ourselves again, in new lights and explorations. However capable we are of tectonic shifts, we remain, still, unmistakably continuous. Glitch Feminism is not gender-specific—it is for all bodies that exist somewhere before arrival upon a final concretized identity that can be easily digested, produced, packaged, and categorized by a voyeuristic mainstream public.

Glitch Feminism therefore is feminism for a digital age, a heralding of virtual agency, a blooming of particularity and selfhood. “Glitch” refuses being categorized as subtext, it rejects being labeled as subversive, it does not speak for the marginal or the subaltern, as “sub-” as a prefix needs to be marked as a mode of acquiescence to our own exclusion from the canon, the academy, the Platonic ideal. The first step to subverting a system is accepting that that system will remain in place; that said, the glitch says fuck your systems! Your delineations! Your determinations as imposed upon our physicality! The glitch respectfully declines second rank to common convention.

Jurgenson’s problematizing of digital dualism opens the door for more discourse and discovery: female-identifying bodies and artists participating in the gorgeous scrambling of gender are still marking their own path within the lineage of art history; in the digital world we have claimed sure footing and a platform that allows us to explore new publics, engage in critical discourse with new audiences, and, above all, glitschen between new conceptions of our bodies, ourselves.

It is a long road ahead, we are in beta, yet the necessary “malfunction” is well under way. As for the outcome? Well, fortunately, it’s still buffering.

VNS Matrix, 1996

The atomic wind catches your wings and you are propelled backwards into the future, an entity time travelling through the late C20th, a space case, an alien angel maybe, looking down the deep throat of a million catastrophes.

screenflash of a millionmillion conscious machines

burns brilliant

users caught in the static blitz of carrier fire

unseeing the download that scribbles on their burntout retinas

seize in postreal epileptic bliss

eat code and die

Sucked in, down through a vortex of banality. You have just missed the twentieth century. You are on the brink of the millenium - which one - what does it matter?

It's the cross dissolve that's captivating. The hot contagion of millenia fever fuses retro with futro, catapulting bodies with organs into technotopia . . . where code dictates pleasure and satisfies desire.

Pretty pretty applets adorn my throat. I am strings of binary. I am pure artifice. 
Read only my memories. Upload me into your pornographic imagination. Write me.

Identity explodes in multiple morphings and infiltrates the system at root.

Unnameable parts of no whole short circuit the code recognition programs flipping surveillance agents into hyperdrive which spew out millions of bits of corrupt data as they seize in fits of schizophrenic panic and trip on terror.

So what's the new millenium got to offer the dirty modemless masses?
Ubiquitous fresh water? Simulation has its limits. Are the artists of oppressed nations on a parallel agenda? Perhaps it is just natural selection?

The net's the parthenogenetic bitch-mutant feral child of big daddy mainframe. She's out of of control, kevin, she's the sociopathic emergent system. 
Lock up your children, gaffer tape the cunt's mouth and shove a rat up her arse.

We're <>verging on the insane and the vandals are swarming. 
Extend my phenotype, baby, give me some of that hot black javamagic you're always bragging about. (I straddle my modem). The extropians were wrong, there's some things you can't transcend.

The pleasure's in the dematerialisation. The devolution of desire.

We are the malignant accident which fell into your system while you were sleeping. And when you wake we will terminate your digital delusions, hijacking your impeccable software.

Your fingers probe my neural network. The tingling sensation in the tips of your fingers are my synapses responding to your touch. It's not chemistry, it's electric. Stop fingering me.

Don't ever stop fingering my suppurating holes, extending my boundary but in cipherspace there are no bounds
BUT IN SPIRALSPACE THERE IS NO THEY
there is only *us*

Trying to flee the binary I enter the chromozone which is not one
XXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXX
genderfuck me baby
resistance is futile

entice me splice me map my ABANDONED genome as your project
artificially involve me
i wanna live forever
upload me in yr shiny shiny PVC future

SUCK MY CODE

Subject X says transcendence lies at the limit of worlds, where now and now, here and elsewhere, text and membrane impact.

Where truth evaporates Where nothing is certain There are no maps

The limit is NO CARRIER, the sudden shock of no contact, reaching out to touch but the skin is cold...

The limit is permission denied, vision doubled, and flesh necrotic.

Where truth evaporates Where nothing is certain There are no maps

The limit is NO CARRIER, the sudden shock of no contact, reaching out to touch but the skin is cold...

The limit is permission denied, vision doubled, and flesh necrotic.

Command line error

Heavy eyelids fold over my pupils, like curtains of lead. Hot ice kisses my synapses with an (ec)static rush. My system is nervous, neuronsscreaming - spiralling towards the singularity. Floating in ether, my body implodes.

I become the FIRE.

Flame me if you dare.

An ironic dream of a common language for women in the integrated circuit

This chapter is an effort to build an ironic political myth faithful to feminism, socialism, and materialism. Perhaps more faithful as blasphemy is faithful, than as reverent worship and identification. Blasphemy has always seemed to require taking things very seriously. I know no better stance to adopt from within the secular-religious, evangelical traditions of United States politics, including the politics of socialist feminism. Blasphemy protects one from the moral majority within, while still insisting on the need for community. Blasphemy is not apostasy. Irony is about contradictions that do not resolve into larger wholes, even dialectically, about the tension of holding incompatible things together because both or all are necessary and true. Irony is about humour and serious play. It is also a rhetorical strategy and a political method, one I would like to see more honoured within socialist-feminism. At the centre of my ironic faith, my blasphemy, is the image of the cyborg.

A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. Social reality is lived social relations, our most important political construction, a world-changing fiction. The international women's movements have constructed 'women's experience', as well as uncovered or discovered this crucial collective object. This experience is a fiction and fact of the most crucial, political kind. Liberation rests on the construction of the consciousness, the imaginative apprehension, of oppression, and so of possibility. The cyborg is a matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as women's experience in the late twentieth century. This is a struggle over life and death, but the boundary between science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion.

Contemporary science fiction is full of cyborgs — creatures simultaneously animal and machine, who populate worlds ambiguously natural and crafted. Modern medicine is also full of cyborgs, of couplings between organism and machine, each conceived as coded devices, in an intimacy and with a power that was not generated in the history of sexuality. Cyborg 'sex' restores some of the lovely replicative baroque of ferns and invertebrates (such nice organic prophylactics against heterosexism). Cyborg replication is uncoupled from organic reproduction. Modern production seems like a dream of cyborg colonization work, a dream that makes the nightmare of Taylorism seem idyllic. And modern war is a cyborg orgy, coded by C3I, command-control-communication-intelligence, an $84 billion item in 1984's US defence budget. I am making an argument for the cyborg as a fiction mapping our social and bodily reality and as an imaginative resource suggesting some very fruitful couplings. Michael Foucault's biopolitics is a flaccid premonition of cyborg politics, a very open field.

By the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism; in short, we are cyborgs. Ths cyborg is our ontology; it gives us our politics. The cyborg is a condensed image of both imagination and material reality, the two joined centres structuring any possibility of historical transformation. In the traditions of 'Western' science and politics — the tradition of racist, male-dominant capitalism; the tradition of progress; the tradition of the appropriation of nature as resource for the productions of culture; the tradition of reproduction of the self from the reflections of the other — the relation between organism and machine has been a border war. The stakes in the border war have been the territories of production, reproduction, and imagination. This chapter is an argument for pleasure in the confusion of boundaries and for responsibility in their construction. It is also an effort to contribute to socialist-feminist culture and theory in a postmodernist, non-naturalist mode and in the utopian tradition of imagining a world without gender, which is perhaps a world without genesis, but maybe also a world without end. The cyborg incarnation is outside salvation history. Nor does it mark time on an oedipal calendar, attempting to heal the terrible cleavages of gender in an oral symbiotic utopia or post-oedipal apocalypse. As Zoe Sofoulis argues in her unpublished manuscript on Jacques Lacan, Melanie Klein, and nuclear culture, Lacklein, the most terrible and perhaps the most promising monsters in cyborg worlds are embodied in non-oedipal narratives with a different logic of repression, which we need to understand for our survival.

The cyborg is a creature in a post-gender world; it has no truck with bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labour, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all the powers of the parts into a higher unity. In a sense, the cyborg has no origin story in the Western sense — a 'final' irony since the cyborg is also the awful apocalyptic telos of the 'West's' escalating dominations of abstract individuation, an ultimate self untied at last from all dependency, a man in space. An origin story in the 'Western', humanist sense depends on the myth of original unity, fullness, bliss and terror, represented by the phallic mother from whom all humans must separate, the task of individual development and of history, the twin potent myths inscribed most powerfully for us in psychoanalysis and Marxism. Hilary Klein has argued that both Marxism and psychoanalysis, in their concepts of labour and of individuation and gender formation, depend on the plot of original unity out of which difference must be produced and enlisted in a drama of escalating domination of woman/nature. The cyborg skips the step of original unity, of identification with nature in the Western sense. This is its illegitimate promise that might lead to subversion of its teleology as star wars.

The cyborg is resolutely committed to partiality, irony, intimacy, and perversity. It is oppositional, utopian, and completely without innocence. No longer structured by the polarity of public and private, the cyborg defines a technological polls based partly on a revolution of social relations in the oikos, the household. Nature and culture are reworked; the one can no longer be the resource for appropriation or incorporation by the other. The rela-tionships for forming wholes from parts, including those of polarity and hierarchical domination, are at issue in the cyborg world. Unlike the hopes of Frankenstein's monster, the cyborg does not expect its father to save it through a restoration of the garden; that is, through the fabrication of a heterosexual mate, through its completion in a finished whole, a city and cosmos. The eyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic family, this time without the oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning to dust. Perhaps that is why I want to see if eyborgs can subvert the apocalypse of returning to nuclear dust in the manic compulsion to name the Enemy. Cyborgs are not reverent; they do not re-member the cosmos. They are wary of holism, but needy for connection- they seem to have a natural feel for united front politics, but without the vanguard party. The main trouble with cyborgs, of course, is that they are the illegitimate offspring of militarism and patriarchal capitalism, not to mention state socialism. But illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins. Their fathers, after all, are inessential.

I will return to the science fiction of cyborgs at the end of this chapter, but now I want to signal three crucial boundary breakdowns that make the following political-fictional (political-scientific) analysis possible. By the late twentieth century in United States scientific culture, the boundary between human and animal is thoroughly breached. The last beachheads of uniqueness have been polluted if not turned into amusement parks--language tool use, social behaviour, mental events, nothing really convincingly settles the separation of human and animal. And many people no longer feel the need for such a separation; indeed, many branches of feminist culture affirm the pleasure of connection of human and other living creatures. Movements for animal rights are not irrational denials of human uniqueness; they are a clear-sighted recognition of connection across the discredited breach of nature and culture. Biology and evolutionary theory over the last two centuries have simultaneously produced modern organisms as objects of knowledge and reduced the line between humans and animals to a faint trace re-etched in ideological struggle or professional disputes between life and social science. Within this framework, teaching modern Christian creationism should be fought as a form of child abuse.

Biological-determinist ideology is only one position opened up in scientific culture for arguing the meanings of human animality. There is much room for radical political people to contest the meanings of the breached boundary.2 The cyborg appears in myth precisely where the boundary between human and animal is transgressed. Far from signalling a walling off of people from other living beings, cyborgs signal distrurbingly and pleasurably tight coupling. Bestiality has a new status in this cycle of marriage exchange.

The second leaky distinction is between animal-human (organism) and machine. Pre-cybernetic machines could be haunted; there was always the spectre of the ghost in the machine. This dualism structured the dialogue between materialism and idealism that was settled by a dialectical progeny, called spirit or history, according to taste. But basically machines were not self-moving, self-designing, autonomous. They could not achieve man's dream, only mock it. They were not man, an author to himself, but only a caricature of that masculinist reproductive dream. To think they were otherwise was paranoid. Now we are not so sure. Late twentieth-century machines have made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and art)ficial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines. Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert.

Technological determination is only one ideological space opened up by the reconceptions of machine and organism as coded texts through which we engage in the play of writing and reading the world.3 'Textualization' of everything in poststructuralist, postmodernist theory has been damned by Marxists and socialist feminists for its utopian disregard for the lived relations of domination that ground the 'play' of arbitrary reading.4 It is certainly true that postmodernist strategies, like my cyborg myth, subvert myriad organic wholes (for example, the poem, the primitive culture, the biological organism). In short, the certainty of what counts as nature — a source of insight and promise of innocence — is undermined, probably fatally. The transcendent authorization of interpretation is lost, and with it the ontology grounding 'Western' epistemology. But the alternative is not cynicism or faithlessness, that is, some version of abstract existence, like the accounts of technological determinism destroying 'man' by the 'machine' or 'meaningful political action' by the 'text'. Who cyborgs will be is a radical question; the answers are a matter of survival. Both chimpanzees and artefacts have politics, so why shouldn't we (de Waal, 1982; Winner, 1980)?

The third distinction is a subset of the second: the boundary between physical and non-physical is very imprecise for us. Pop physics books on the consequences of quantum theory and the indeterminacy principle are a kind of popular scientific equivalent to Harlequin romances* as a marker of radical change in American white heterosexuality: they get it wrong, but they are on the right subject. Modern machines are quintessentially microelectronic devices: they are everywhere and they are invisible. Modern machinery is an irreverent upstart god, mocking the Father's ubiquity and spirituality. The silicon chip is a surface for writing; it is etched in molecular scales disturbed only by atomic noise, the ultimate interference for nuclear scores. Writing, power, and technology are old partners in Western stories of the origin of civilization, but miniaturization has changed our experience of mechanism. Miniaturization has turned out to be about power; small is not so much beautiful as pre-eminently dangerous, as in cruise missiles. Contrast the TV sets of the 1950s or the news cameras of the 1970s with the TV wrist bands or hand-sized video cameras now advertised. Our best machines are made of sunshine; they are all light and clean because they are nothing but signals, electromagnetic waves, a section of a spectrum, and these machines are eminently portable, mobile — a matter of immense human pain in Detroit and Singapore. People are nowhere near so fluid, being both material and opaque. Cyborgs are ether, quintessence.

The ubiquity and invisibility of cyborgs is precisely why these sunshine-belt machines are so deadly. They are as hard to see politically as materially. They are about consciousness — or its simulation.5 They are floating signIfiers moving in pickup trucks across Europe, blocked more effectively by the witch-weavings of the displaced and so unnatural Greenham women, who read the cyborg webs of power so very well, than by the militant labour of older masculinist politics, whose natural constituency needs defence jobs. Ultimately the 'hardest' science is about the realm of greatest boundary confusion, the realm of pure number, pure spirit, C3I, cryptography, and the preservation of potent secrets. The new machines are so clean and light. Their engineers are sun-worshippers mediating a new scientific revolution associated with the night dream of post-industrial society. The diseases evoked by these clean machines are 'no more' than the minuscule coding changes of an antigen in the immune system, 'no more' than the experience of stress. The nimble fingers of 'Oriental' women, the old fascination of little Anglo-Saxon Victorian girls with doll's houses, women's enforced attention to the small take on quite new dimensions in this world. There might be a cyborg Alice taking account of these new dimensions. Ironically, it might be the unnatural cyborg women making chips in Asia and spiral dancing in Santa Rita jail2 whose constructed unities will guide effective oppositional strategies.

So my cyborg myth is about transgressed boundaries, potent fusions, and dangerous possibilities which progressive people might explore as one part of needed political work. One of my premises is that most American socialists and feminists see deepened dualisms of mind and body, animal and machine, idealism and materialism in the social practices, symbolic formula-tions, and physical artefacts associated with 'high technology' and scientific culture. From One-DimensionalMan (Marcuse, 1964) to The Death of Nature (Merchant, 1980), the analytic resources developed by progressives have insisted on the necessary domination of technics and recalled us to an imagined organic body to integrate our resistance. Another of my premises is that the need for unity of people trying to resist world-wide intensification of domination has never been more acute. But a slightly perverse shift of perspective might better enable us to contest for meanings, as well as for other forms of power and pleasure in technologically mediated societies.

From one perspective, a cyborg world is about the final imposition of a grid of control on the planet, about the final abstraction embodied in a Star Wars apocalypse waged in the name of defence, about the final appropriation of women's bodies in a masculinist orgy of war (Sofia, 1984). From another perspective, a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodily realities in which people are not afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines, not afraid of permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints. The political struggle is to see from both perspectives at once because each reveals both dominations and possibilities unimaginable from the other vantage point. Single vision produces worse illusions than double vision or many-headed monsters. Cyborg unities are monstrous and illegitimate; in our present political circumstances, we could hardly hope for more potent myths for resistance and recoupling. I like to imagine LAG, the Livermore Action Group, as a kind of cyborg society, dedicated to realistically converting the laboratories that most fiercely embody and spew out the tools.

Of technological apocalypse, and committed to building a political form that acutally manages to hold together witches, engineers, elders, perverts, Christians, mothers, and Leninists long enough to disarm the state. Fission Impossible is the name of the affinity group in my town.(Affinity: related not by blood but by choice, the appeal of one chemical nuclear group for another, avidiy.)6

Fractured identities
It has become difficult to name one's feminism by a single adjective — or even to insist in every circumstance upon the noun. Consciousness of exclusion through naming is acute. Identities seem contradictory, partial, and strategic. With the hard-won recognition of their social and historical constitution, gender, race, and class cannot provide the basis for belief in 'essential' unity. There is nothing about teeing 'female' that naturally binds women. There is not even such a state as 'being' female, itself a highly complex category constructed in contested sexual scientific discourses and other social practices. Gender, race, or class consciousness is an achievement forced on us by the terrible historica experience of the contradictory social realities of patriarchy, colonialism, and capitalism. And who counts as 'us' in my own rhetoric? Which identities are available to ground such a potent political myth called 'us', and what could motivate enlistment in this collectivity? Painful fragmentation among feminists (not to mention among women) along every possible fault line has made the concept of woman elusive, an excuse for the matrix of women's dominations of each other. For me — and for many who share a similar historical location in white, professional middle-class, female, radical, North American, mid-adult bodies — the sources of a crisis in political identity are legion. The recent history for much of the US left and US feminism has been a response to this kind of crisis by endless splitting and searches for a new essential unity. But there has also been a growing recognition of another response through coalition — affinity, not identity.7

Chela Sandoval (n.d., 1984), from a consideration of specific historical moments in the formation of the new political voice called women of colour, has theorized a hopeful model of political identity called 'oppositional consciousness', born of the skills for reading webs of power by those refused stable membership in the social categories of race, sex, or class. 'Women of color', a name contested at its origins by those whom it would incorporate, as well as a historical consciousness marking systematic breakdown of all the signs of Man in 'Western' traditions, constructs a kind of postmodernist identity out of otherness, difference, and specificity. This postmodernist identity is fully political, whatever might be said abut other possible postmodernisms. Sandoval's oppositional consciousness is about contradictory locations and heterochronic calendars, not about relativisms and pluralisms.

Sandoval emphasizes the lack of any essential criterion for identifying who is a woman of colour. She notes that the definition of the group has been by conscious appropriation of negation. For example, a Chicana or US black woman has not been able to speak as a woman or as a black person or as a Chicano. Thus, she was at the bottom of a cascade of negative identities, left out of even the privileged oppressed authorial categories called 'women and blacks', who claimed to make the important revolutions. The category 'woman' negated all non-white women; 'black' negated all non-black people, as well as all black women. But there was also no 'she', no singularity, but a sea of differences among US women who have affirmed their historical identity as US women of colour. This identity marks out a self-consciously constructed space that cannot affirm the capacity to act on the basis of natural identification, but only on the basis of conscious coalition, of affinity, of political kinship.8 Unlike the 'woman' of some streams of the white women's movement in the United States, there is no naturalization of the matrix, or at least this is what Sandoval argues is uniquely available through the power of oppositional consciousness.

Sandoval's argument has to be seen as one potent formulation for feminists out of the world-wide development of anti-colonialist discourse; that is to say, discourse dissolving the 'West' and its highest product — the one who is not animal, barbarian, or woman; man, that is, the author of a cosmos called history. As orientalism is deconstructed politically and semiotically, the identities of the occident destabilize, including those of feminists.9 Sandoval argues that 'women of colour' have a chance to build an effective unity that does not replicate the imperializing, totalizing revolutionary subjects of previous Marxisms and feminisms which had not faced the consequences of the disorderly polyphony emerging from decolonization.

Katie King has emphasized the limits of identification and the political/ poetic mechanics of identification built into reading 'the poem', that generative core of cultural feminism. King criticizes the persistent tendency among contemporary feminists from different 'moments' or 'conversations' in feminist practice to taxonomize the women's movement to make one's own political tendencies appear to be the telos of the whole. These taxonomies tend to remake feminist history so that it appears to be an ideological struggle among coherent types persisting over time, especially those typical units called radical, liberal, and socialist-feminism. Literally, all other feminisms are either incorporated or marginalized, usually by building an explicit ontology and epistemology.10 Taxonomies of feminism produce epistemologies to police deviation from official women's experience. And of course, 'women's culture', like women of colour, is consciously created by mechanisms inducing affinity. The rituals of poetry, music, and certain forms of academic practice have been pre-eminent. The politics of race and culture in the US women's movements are intimately interwoven. The common achievement of King and Sandoval is learning how to craft a poetic/political unity without relying on a logic of appropriation, incorporation, and taxonomic identification.

The theoretical and practical struggle against unity-through-domination or unity-through-incorporation ironically not only undermines the justifica-tions for patriarchy, colonialism, humanism, positivism, essentialism, scient-ism, and other unlamented -isms, but all claims for an organic or natural standpoint. I think that radical and socialist/Marxist-feminisms have also undermined their/our own epistemological strategies and that this is a crucially valuable step in imagining possible unities. It remains to be seen whether all 'epistemologies' as Western political people have known them fail us in the task to build effective affinities.

It is important to note that the effort to construct revolutionary stand-points, epistemologies as achievements of people committed to changing the world, has been part of the process showing the limits of identification. The acid tools of postmodernist theory and the constructive tools of ontological discourse about revolutionary subjects might be seen as ironic allies in dissolving Western selves in the interests of survival. We are excruciatingly conscious of what it means to have a historically constituted body. But with the loss of innocence in our origin, there is no expulsion from the Garden either. Our politics lose the indulgence of guilt with the naivete of innocence. But what would another political myth for socialist-feminism look like? What kind of politics could embrace partial, contradictory, permanently unclosed constructions of personal and collective selves and still be faithful, effective — and, ironically, socialist-feminist?

I do not know of any other time in history when there was greater need for political unity to confront effectively the dominations of 'race', 'gender', 'sexuality', and 'class'. I also do not know of any other time when the kind of unity we might help build could have been possible. None of 'us' have any longer the symbolic or material capability of dictating the shape of reality to any of'them'. Or at least 'we' cannot claim innocence from practicing such dominations. White women, including socialist feminists, discovered (that is, were forced kicking and screaming to notice) the non-innocence of the category 'woman'. That consciousness changes the geography of all previous categories; it denatures them as heat denatures a fragile protein. Cyborg feminists have to argue that 'we' do not want any more natural matrix of unity and that no construction is whole. Innocence, and the corollary insistence on victimhood as the only ground for insight, has done enough damage. But the constructed revolutionary subject must give late-twentieth-century people pause as well. In the fraying of identities and in the reflexive strategies for constructing them, the possibility opens up for weaving something other than a shroud for the day after the apocalypse that so prophetically ends salvation history.

Both Marxist/socialist-feminisms and radical feminisms have simul-taneously naturalized and denatured the category 'woman' and conscious-ness of the social lives of 'women'. Perhaps a schematic caricature can highlight both kinds of moves. Marxian socialism is rooted in an analysis of wage labour which reveals class structure. The consequence of the wage relationship is systematic alienation, as the worker is dissociated from his (sic) product. Abstraction and illusion rule in knowledge, domination rules in practice. Labour is the pre-eminently privileged category enabling the Marxist to overcome illusion and find that point of view which is necessary for changing the world. Labour is the humanizing activity that makes man; labour is an ontological category permitting the knowledge of a subject, and so the knowledge of subjugation and alienation.

In faithful filiation, socialist-feminism advanced by allying itself with the basic analytic strategies of Marxism. The main achievement of both Marxist feminists and socialist feminists was to expand the category of labour to accommodate what (some) women did, even when the wage relation was subordinated to a more comprehensive view of labour under capitalist patriarchy. In particular, women's labour in the household and women's activity as mothers generally (that is, reproduction in the socialist-feminist sense), entered theory on the authority of analogy to the Marxian concept of labour. The unity of women here rests on an epistemology based on the ontological structure of'labour'. Marxist/socialist-feminism does not 'natur-alize' unity; it is a possible achievement based on a possible standpoint rooted in social relations. The essentializing move is in the ontological structure of labour or of its analogue, women's activity.11 The inheritance of Marxian humanism, with its pre-eminently Western self, is the difficulty for me. The contribution from these formulations has been the emphasis on the daily responsibility of real women to build unities, rather than to naturalize them.

Catherine MacKinnon's (198Z, 1987) version of radical feminism is itself a caricature of the appropriating, incorporating, totalizing tendencies of Western theories of identity grounding action.12 It is factually and politically wrong to assimilate all of the diverse 'moments' or 'conversations' in recent women's politics named radical feminism to MacKinnon's version. But the teleological logic of her theory shows how an epistemology and ontology — including their negations — erase or police difference. Only one of the effects of MacKinnon's theory is the rewriting of the history of the polymorphous field called radical feminism. The major effect is the production of a theory of experience, of women's identity, that is a kind of apocalypse for all revolutionary standpoints. That is, the totalization built into this tale of radical feminism achieves its end — the unity of women — by enforcing the experience of and testimony to radical non-being. As for the Marxist/ socialist feminist, consciousness is an achievement, not a natural fact. And MacKinnon's theory eliminates some of the difficulties built into humanist revolutionary subjects, but at the cost of radical reductionism.

MacKinnon argues that feminism necessarily adopted a different analyt-ical strategy from Marxism, looking first not at the structure of class, but at the structure of sex/gender and its generative relationship, men's constitu-tion and appropriation of women sexually. Ironically, MacKinnon's 'ontology' constructs a non-subject, a non-being. Another's desire, not the self's labour, is the origin of 'woman'. She therefore develops a theory of consciousness that enforces what can count as 'women's' experience — anything that names sexual violation, indeed, sex itself as far as 'women' can be concerned. Feminist practice is the construction of this form of consciousness; that is, the self-knowledge of a self-who-is-not.

Perversely, sexual appropriation in this feminism still has the epistemolo-gical status of labour; that is to say, the point from which an analysis able to contribute to changing the world must flow. But sexual object)fication, not alienation, is the consequence of the structure of sex/gender. In the realm of knowledge, the result of sexual objectification is illusion and abstraction. However, a woman is not simply alienated from her product, but in a deep sense does not exist as a subject, or even potential subject, since she owes her existence as a woman to sexual appropriation. To be constituted by another's desire is not the same thing as to be alienated in the violent separation of the labourer from his product.

MacKinnon's radical theory of experience is totalizing in the extreme; it does not so much marginalize as obliterate the authority of any other women's political speech and action. It is a totalization producing what Western patriarchy itself never succeeded in doing — feminists' consciousness of the non-existence of women, except as products of men's desire. I think MacKinnon correctly argues that no Marxian version of identity can firmly ground women's unity. But in solving the problem of the contradictions of any Western revolutionary subject for feminist purposes, she develops an even more authoritarian doctrine of experience. If my complaint about socialist/Marxian standpoints is their unintended erasure of polyvocal, unassimilable, radical difference made visible in anti-colonial discourse and practice, MacKinnon's intentional erasure of all difference through the device of the 'essential' non-existence of women is not reassuring.

In my taxonomy, which like any other taxonomy is a re-inscription of history, radical feminism can accommodate all the activities of women named by socialist feminists as forms of labour only if the activity can somehow be sexualized. Reproduction had different tones of meanings for the two tendencies, one rooted in labour, one in sex, both calling the consequences of domination and ignorance of social and personal reality 'false consciousness'.

Beyond either the diff~culties or the contributions in the argument of any one author, neither Marxist nor radical feminist points of view have tended to embrace the status of a partial explanation; both were regularly constituted as totalities. Western explanation has demanded as much; how else could the 'Western' author incorporate its others? Each tried to annex other forms of domination by expanding its basic categories through analogy, simple listing, or addition. Embarrassed silence about race among white radical and socialist feminists was one major, devastating political consequence. History and polyvocality disappear into political taxonomies that try to establish genealogies. There was no structural room for race (or for much else) in theory claiming to reveal the construction of the category woman and social group women as a unified or totalizable whole. The structure of my caricature looks like this:

socialist feminism--structure of class // wage labour // alienation labour, by analogy reproduction, by extension sex, by addition race radical feminism — structure of gender // sexual appropriation // objectification] sex, by analogy labour, by extension reproduction, by addition race

In another context, the French theorist, Julia Kristeva, claimed women appeared as a historical group after the Second World War, along with groups like youth. Her dates are doubtful; but we are now accustomed to remembering that as objects of knowledge and as historical actors, 'race' did not always exist, 'class' has a historical genesis, and 'homosexuals' are quite junior. It is no accident that the symbolic system of the family of man — and so the essence of woman — breaks up at the same moment that networks of connection among people on the planet are unprecedentedly multiple, pregnant, and complex. 'Advanced capitalism' is inadequate to convey the structure of this historical moment. In the 'Western' sense, the end of man is at stake. It is no accident that woman disintegrates into women in our time. Perhaps socialist feminists were not substantially guilty of producing essentialist theory that suppressed women's particularity and contradictory interests. I think we have been, at least through unreflective participation in the logics, languages, and practices of white humanism and through searching for a single ground of domination to secure our revolutionary voice. Now we have less excuse. But in the consciousness of our failures, we risk lapsing into boundless difference and giving up on the confusing task of making partial, real connection. Some differences are playful; some are poles of world historical systems of domination. 'Epistemology' is about knowing the difference.

THE INFORMATICS OF DOMINATION
In this attempt at an epistemological and political position, I would like to sketch a picture of possible unity, a picture indebted to socialist and feminist principles of design. The frame for my sketch is set by the extent and importance of rearrangements in world-wide social relations tied to science and technology. I argue for a politics rooted in claims about fundamental changes in the nature of class, race, and gender in an emerging system of world order analogous in its novelty and scope to that created by industrial capitalism; we are living through a movement from an organic, industrial society to a polymorphous, information system--from all work to all play, a deadly game. Simultaneously material and ideological, the dichotomies may be expressed in the following chart of transitions from the comfortable old hierarchical dominations to the scary new networks I have called the informatics of domination:

This list suggests several interesting things.13 First, the objects on the right-hand side cannot be coded as 'natural', a realization that subverts naturalistic coding for the left-hand side as well. We cannot go back ideologically or materially. It's not just that igod'is dead; so is the 'goddess'. Or both are revivified in the worlds charged with microelectronic and biotechnological politics. In relation to objects like biotic components, one must not think in terms of essential properties, but in terms of design, boundary constraints, rates of flows, systems logics, costs of lowering constraints. Sexual reproduction is one kind of reproductive strategy among many, with costs and benefits as a function of the system environment. Ideologies of sexual reproduction can no longer reasonably call on notions of sex and sex role as organic aspects in natural objects like organisms and families. Such reasoning will be unmasked as irrational, and ironically corporate executives reading Playboy and anti-porn radical feminists will make strange bedfellows in jointly unmasking the irrationalism.

Likewise for race, ideologies about human diversity have to be formulated in terms of frequencies of parameters, like blood groups or intelligence scores. It is 'irrational' to invoke concepts like primitive and civilized. For liberals and radicals, the search for integrated social systems gives way to a new practice called 'experimental ethnography' in which an organic object dissipates in attention to the play of writing. At the level of ideology, we see translations of racism and colonialism into languages of development and under-development, rates and constraints of modernization. Any objects or persons can be reasonably thought of in terms of disassembly and reassembly; no 'natural' architectures constrain system design. The financial districts in all the world's cities, as well as the export-processing and free-trade zones, proclaim this elementary fact of'late capitalism'. The entire universe of objects that can be known scientifically must be formulated as problems in communications engineering (for the managers) or theories of the text (for those who would resist). Both are cyborg semiologies.

One should expect control strategies to concentrate on boundary conditions and interfaces, on rates of flow across boundaries — and not on the integrity of natural objects. 'Integrity' or 'sincerity' of the Western self gives way to decision procedures and expert systems. For example, control strategies applied to women's capacities to give birth to new human beings will be developed in the languages of population control and maximization of goal achievement for individual decision-makers. Control strategies will be formulated in terms of rates, costs of constraints, degrees of freedom. Human beings, like any other component or subsystem, must be localized in a system architecture whose basic modes of operation are probabilistic, statistical. No objects, spaces, or bodies are sacred in themselves; any component can be interfaced with any other if the proper standard, the proper code, can be constructed for processing signals in a common language. Exchange in this world transcends the universal translation effected by capitalist markets that Marx analysed so well. The privileged pathology affecting all kinds of components in this universe is stress — communications breakdown (Hogness, 1983). The cyborg is not subject to Foucault's biopolitics; the cyborg simulates politics, a much more potent field of operations.

This kind of analysis of scientific and cultural objects of knowledge which have appeared historically since the Second World War prepares us to notice some important inadequacies in feminist analysis which has proceeded as if the organic, hierarchical dualisms ordering discourse in 'the West' since Aristotle still ruled. They have been cannibalized, or as Zoe Sofia (Sofoulis) might put it, they have been 'techno-digested'. The dichotomies between mind and body, animal and human, organism and machine, public and private, nature and culture, men and women, primitive and civilized are all in question ideologically. The actual situation of women is their integration/ exploitation into a world system of production/reproduction and com-munication called the informatics of domination. The home, workplace, market, public arena, the body itself- all can be dispersed and interfaced in nearly infinite, polymorphous ways, with large consequences for women and others — consequences that themselves are very different for different people and which make potent oppositional international movements difficult to imagine and essential for survival. One important route for reconstructing socialist-feminist politics is through theory and practice addressed to the social relations of science and technology, including crucially the systems of myth and meanings structuring our imaginations. The cyborg is a kind of disassembled and reassembled, postmodern collective and personal self. This is the self feminists must code.

Communications technologies and biotechnologies are the crucial tools recrafting our bodies. These tools embody and enforce new social relations for women world-wide. Technologies and scientific discourses can be partially understood as formalizations, i.e., as frozen moments, of the fluid social interactions constituting them, but they should also be viewed as instruments for enforcing meanings. The boundary is permeable between tool and myth, instrument and concept, historical systems of social relations and historical anatomies of possible bodies, including objects of knowledge. Indeed, myth and tool mutually constitute each other.

Furthermore, communications sciences and modern biologies are constructed by a common move — the translation of the world into a problem of coding, a search for a common language in which all resistance to instrumental control disappears and all heterogeneity can be submitted to disassembly, reassembly, investment, and exchange.

In communications sciences, the translation of the world into a problem in coding can be illustrated by looking at cybernetic (feedback-controlled) systems theories applied to telephone technology, computer design, weapons deployment, or data base construction and maintenance. In each case, solution to the key questions rests on a theory of language and control; the key operation is determining the rates, directions, and probabilities of flow of a quantity called information. The world is subdivided by boundaries differentially permeable to information. Information is just that kind of quantifiable element (unit, basis of unity) which allows universal translation, and so unhindered instrumental power (called effective communication). The biggest threat to such power is interruption of communication. Any system breakdown is a function of stress. The fundamentals of this technology can be condensed into the metaphor C31, command-controlcommunication-intelligence, the military's symbol for its operations theory.

In modern biologies, the translation of the world into a problem in coding can be illustrated by molecular genetics, ecology, sociobiological evolutionary theory, and immunobiology. The organism has been translated into prob-lems of genetic coding and read-out. Biotechnology, a writing technology, informs research broadly.14 In a sense, organisms have ceased to exist as objects of knowledge, giving way to biotic components, i.e., special kinds of information-processing devices. The analogous moves in ecology could be examined by probing the history and utility of the concept of the ecosystem. Immunobiology and associated medical practices are rich exemplars of the privilege of coding and recognition systems as objects of knowledge, as constructions of bodily reality for us. Biology here is a kind of cryptography. Research is necessarily a kind of intelligence activity. Ironies abound. A stressed system goes awry; its communication processes break down; it fails to recognize the difference between self and other. Human babies with baboon hearts evoke national ethical perplexity — for animal rights activists at least as much as for the guardians of human purity. In the US gay men and intravenous drug users are the 'privileged' victims of an awful immune system disease that marks (inscribes on the body) confusion of boundaries and moral pollution (Treichler, 1987).

But these excursions into communications sciences and biology have been at a rarefied level; there is a mundane, largely economic reality to support my claim that these sciences and technologies indicate fundamental transforma-tions in the structure of the world for us. Communications technologies depend on electronics. Modern states, multinational corporations, military power, welfare state apparatuses, satellite systems, political processes, fabrication of our imaginations, labour-control systems, medical construc-tions of our bodies, commercial pornography, the international division of labour, and religious evangelism depend intimately upon electronics. Micro-electronics is the technical basis of simulacra; that is, of copies without originals.

Microelectronics mediates the translations of labour into robotics and word processing, sex into genetic engineering and reproductive technologies, and mind into artificial intelligence and decision procedures. The new biotechnologies concern more than human reproducdon. Biology as a powerful engineering science for redesigning materials and processes has revolutionary implications for industry, perhaps most obvious today in areas of fermentadon, agriculture, and energy. Communicadons sciences and biology are construcdons of natural-technical objects of knowledge in which the difference between machine and organism is thoroughly blurred; mind, body, and tool are on very intimate terms. The 'multinational' material organization of the production and reproduction of daily life and the symbolic organization of the production and reproduction of culture and imagination seem equally implicated. The boundary-maintaining images of base and superstructure, public and private, or material and ideal never seemed more feeble.

I have used Rachel Grossman's (1980) image of women in the integrated circuit to name the situation of women in a world so intimately restructured through the social relations of science and technology.15 I used the odd circumlocution, 'the social relations of science and technology', to indicate that we are not dealing with a technological determinism, but with a historical system depending upon structured relations among people. But the phrase should also indicate that science and technology provide fresh sources of power, that we need fresh sources of analysis and political action (Latour, 1984). Some of the rearrangements of race, sex, and class rooted in high-tech-facilitated social relations can make socialist-feminism more relevant to effective progressive politics.

The 'homework economy' outside 'the home'
The 'New Industrial Revolution' is producing a new world-wide working class, as well as new sexualities and ethnicities. The extreme mobility of capital and the emerging international division of labour are intertwined with the emergence of new collecdvities, and the weakening of familiar groupings. These developments are neither gender- nor race-neutral. White men in advanced industrial societies have become newly vulnerable to permanent job loss, and women are not disappearing from the job rolls at the same rates as men. It is not simply that women in Third World countries are the preferred labour force for the science-based multinationals in the export-processing sectors, particularly in electronics. The picture is more systematic and involves reproduction, sexuality, culture, consumphon, and producdon. In the prototypical Silicon Valley, many women's lives have been structured around employment in electronics-dependent jobs, and their intimate realities include serial heterosexual monogamy, negotiating childcare, distance from extended kin or most other forms of traditional community, a high likelihood of loneliness and extreme economic vulnerability as they age. The ethnic and racial diversity of women in Silicon Valley structures a microcosm of conflicting differences in culture, family, religion, education, and language.

Richard Gordon has called this new situation the 'homework economy'.16 Although he includes the phenomenon of literal homework emerging in connecdon with electronics assembly, Gordon intends 'homework economy' to name a restructuring of work that broadly has the characteristics formerly ascribed to female jobs, jobs literally done only by women. Work is being redefined as both literally female and feminized, whether performed by men or women. To be feminized means to be made extremely vulnerable; able to be disassembled, reassembled, exploited as a reserve labour force; seen less as workers than as servers; subjected to dme arrangements on and off the paid job that make a mockery of a limited work day; leading an existence that always borders on being obscene, out of place, and reducible to sex. Deskilling is an old strategy newly applicable to formerly privileged workers. However, the homework economy does not refer only to large-scale deskilling, nor does it deny that new areas of high skill are emerging, even for women and men previously excluded from skilled employment. Rather, the concept indicates that factory, home, and market are integrated on a new scale and that the places of women are crucial — and need to be analysed for differences among women and for meanings for relations between men and women in various situations.

The homework economy as a world capitalist organizational structure is made possible by (not caused by) the new technologies. The success of the attack on relatively privileged, mostly white, men's unionized jobs is deaf to the power of the new communications technologies to integrate and control labour despite extensive dispersion and decentralization. The consequences of the new technologies are felt by women both in the loss of the family (male) wage (if they ever had access to this white privilege) and in the character of their own jobs, which are becoming capital-intensive; for example, office work and nursing.

The new economic and technological arrangements are also related to the collapsing welfare state and the ensuing intensification of demands on women to sustain daily life for themselves as well as for men, children, and old people. The feminization of poverty — generated by dismantling the welfare state, by the homework economy where stable jobs become the exception, and sustained by the expectation that women's wages will not be matched by a male income for the support of children — has become an urgent focus. The causes of various women-headed households are a function of race, class, or sexuality; but their increasing generality is a ground for coalitions of women on many issues. That women regularly sustain daily life partly as a funcdon of their enforced status as mothers is hardly new; the kind of integration with the overall capitalist and progressively war-based economy is new. The particular pressure, for example, on US black women, who have achieved an escape from (barely) paid domeshc service and who now hold clerical and similar jobs in large numbers, has large implicadons for condnued enforced black poverty with employment. Teenage women in industrializing areas of the Third World increasingly find themselves the sole or major source of a cash wage for their families, while access to land is ever more problemadc. These developments must have major consequences in the psychodynamics and politics of gender and race.

Within the framework of three major stages of capitalism (commercial/ early industrial, monopoly, multinational) — tied to nationalism, imperialism, and multinationalism, and related to Jameson's three dominant aesthetic periods of realism, modernism, and postmodernism — I would argue that specific forms of families dialectically relate to forms of capital and to its political and cultural concomitants. Although lived problematically and unequally, ideal forms of these families might be schematized as (1) the patriarchal nuclear family, structured by the dichotomy between public and private and accompanied by the white bourgeois ideology of separate spheres and nineteenth-century Anglo-American bourgeois feminism; (2) the modern family mediated (or enforced) by the welfare state and institutions like the family wage, with a flowering of a-feminist heterosexual ideologies, including their radical versions represented in Greenwich Village around the First World War; and (3) the 'family' of the homework economy with its oxymoronic structure of women-headed households and its explosion of feminisms and the paradoxical intensification and erosion of gender itself.

This is the context in which the projections for world-wide structural unemployment stemming from the new technologies are part of the picture of the homework economy. As robodcs and related technologies put men out of work in 'developed' countries and exacerbate failure to generate male jobs in Third World 'development', and as the automated of fice becomes the rule even in labour-surplus countries, the feminization of work intensifies. Black women in the United States have long known what it looks like to face the structural underemployment ('feminization') of black men, as well as their own highly vulnerable position in the wage economy. It is no longer a secret that sexuality, reproduction, family, and community life are interwoven with this economic structure in myriad ways which have also differentiated the situations of white and black women. Many more women and men will contend with similar situations, which will make cross-gender and race alliances on issues of basic life support (with or without jobs) necessary, not just mice.

The new technologies also have a profound effect on hunger and on food production for subsistence world-wide. Rae Lessor Blumberg (1983) estimates that women produce about 50 per cent of the world's subsistence food.17 Women are excluded generally from benefiting from the increased high-tech commodification of food and energy crops, their days are made more arduous because their responsibilides to provide food do not diminish, and their reproductive situations are made more complex. Green Revolution technologies interact with other high-tech industrial production to alter gender divisions of labour and differential gender migration patterns.

The new technologies seem deeply involved in the forms of'privatization' that Ros Petchesky (1981) has analysed, in which militarization, right-wing family ideologies and policies, and intensified definitions of corporate (and state) property as private synergistically interact.18 The new communications technologies are fundamental to the eradication of 'public life' for everyone. This facilitates the mushrooming of a permanent high-tech military establishment at the cultural and economic expense of most people, but especially of women. 

Technologies like video games and highly miniaturized televi-sions seem crucial to production of modern forms of 'private life'. The culture of video games is heavily orientated to individual compedtion and extraterrestrial warfare. High-tech, gendered imaginations are produced here, imaginations that can contemplate destruction of the planet and a sci-fi escape from its consequences. More than our imaginations is militarized; and the other realities of electronic and nuclear warfare are inescapable. These are the technologies that promise ultimate mobility and perfect exchange — and incidentally enable tourism, that perfect practice of mobility and exchange, to emerge as one of the world's largest single industries.

The new technologies affect the social relations of both sexuality and of reproduction, and not always in the same ways. The close ties of sexuality and instrumentality, of views of the body as a kind of private satisfaction- and utility-maximizing machine, are described nicely in sociobiological origin stories that stress a genetic calculus and explain the inevitable dialectic of domination of male and female gender roles.19 These sociobiological stories depend on a high-tech view of the body as a biotic component or cybernetic communications system. Among the many transformations of reproductive situations is the medical one, where women's bodies have boundaries newly permeable to both 'visualization' and 'intervention'. Of course, who controls the interpretation of bodily boundaries in medical hermeneubcs is a major feminist issue. The speculum served as an icon of women's claiming their bodies in the 1970S; that handcraft tool is inadequate to express our needed body politics in the negotiation of reality in the practices of cyborg reproduction. Self-help is not enough. The technologies of visualization recall the important cultural practice of hundng with the camera and the deeply predatory nature of a photographic consciousness.20 Sex, sexuality, and reproduction are central actors in high-tech myth systems structuring our imaginations of personal and social possibility.

Another critical aspect of the social relations of the new technologies is the reformulation of expectations, culture, work, and reproduction for the large scientific and technical work-force. A major social and political danger is the formation of a strongly bimodal social structure, with the masses of women and men of all ethnic groups, but especially people of colour, confined to a homework economy, illiteracy of several varieties, and general redundancy and impotence, controlled by high-tech repressive apparatuses ranging from entertainment to surveillance and disappearance. An adequate socialist-feminist politics should address women in the privileged occupational categories, and particularly in the production of science and technology that constructs scientific-technical discourses, processes, and objects.21
This issue is only one aspect of enquiry into the possibility of a feminist science, but it is important. What kind of constitutive role in the production of knowledge, imagination, and practice can new groups doing science have? How can these groups be allied with progressive social and political movements? What kind of political accountability can be constructed to the women together across the scientific-technical hierarchies separating us? Might there be ways of developing feminist science/technology politics in alliance with and-military science facility conversion action groups? Many sciendfic and technical workers in Silicon Valley, the high-tech cowboys included, do not want to work on military science.22 Can these personal preferences and cultural tendencies be welded into progressive politics among this professional middle class in which women, including women of colour, are coming to be fairly numerous?

Women in the integrated circuit
Let me summarize the picture of women's historical locations in advanced industrial societies, as these positions have been restructured partly through the social relations of science and technology. If it was ever possible ideologically to characterize women's lives by the disdnction of public and private domains — suggested by images of the division of working-class life into factory and home, of bourgeois life into market and home, and of gender existence into personal and political realms — it is now a totally misleading ideology, even to show how both terms of these dichotomies construct each other in practice and in theory. I prefer a network ideological image, suggesting the profusion of spaces and identities and the permeability of boundaries in the personal body and in the body politic. 'Networking' is both a feminist practice and a multinational corporate strategy — weaving is for oppositional cyborgs.

So let me return to the earlier image of the informatics of domination and trace one vision of women's 'place' in the integrated circuit, touching only a few idealized social locations seen primarily from the point of view of advanced capitalist societies: Home, Market, Paid Work Place, State, School, Clinic-Hospital, and Church. Each of these idealized spaces is logically and practically implied in every other locus, perhaps analogous to a holographic photograph. I want to suggest the impact of the social relations mediated and enforced by the new technologies in order to help formulate needed analysis and practical work. However, there is no 'place' for women in these networks, only geometries of difference and contradiction crucial to women's cyborg identities. If we learn how to read these webs of power and social life, we might learn new couplings, new coalitions. There is no way to read the following list from a standpoint of'idendfication', of a unitary self. The issue is dispersion. The task is to survive in the diaspora.

Home: Women-headed households, serial monogamy, flight of men, old women alone, technology of domestic work, paid homework, re-emergence of home sweat-shops, home-based businesses and telecom-muting, electronic cottage, urban homelessness, migration, module architecture, reinforced (simulated) nuclear family, intense domestic violence.

Market: Women's continuing consumption work, newly targeted to buy the profusion of new production from the new technologies (especially as the competitive race among industrialized and industrializing nations to avoid dangerous mass unemployment necessitates finding ever bigger new markets for ever less clearly needed commodities); bimodal buying power, coupled with advertising targeting of the numerous affluent groups and neglect of the previous mass markets; growing importance of informal markets in labour and commodities parallel to high-tech, affluent market structures; surveillance systems through electronic funds transfer; intensified market abstraction (commodification) of experience, resulting in ineffective utopian or equivalent cynical theories of community; extreme mobility (abstraction) of marketing/financing systems; inter-penetration of sexual and labour markets; intensified sexualization of abstracted and alienated consumption.

Paid Work Place: Continued intense sexual and racial division of labour, but considerable growth of membership in privileged occupational categories for many white women and people of colour; impact of new technologies on women's work in clerical, service, manufacturing (especially textiles), agriculture, electronics; international restructuring of the working classes; development of new time arrangements to facilitate the homework economy (flex time, part time, over time, no time); homework and out work; increased pressures for two-tiered wage structures; significant numbers of people in cash-dependent populations world-wide with no experience or no further hope of stable employment; most labour 'marginal' or 'feminized'.

State: Continued erosion of the welfare state; decentralizations with increased surveillance and control; citizenship by telematics; imperialism and political power broadly in the form of information rich/information poor differentiation; increased high-tech militarization increasingly opposed by many social groups; reduction of civil service jobs as a result of the growing capital intensification of office work, with implications for occupational mobility for women of colour; growing privadzation of material and ideological life and culture; close integration of privatization and militarization, the high-tech forms of bourgeois capitalist personal and public life; invisibility of different social groups to each other, linked to psychological mechanisms of belief in abstract enemies.

School: Deepening coupling of high-tech capital needs and public educa-tion at all levels, differentiated by race, class, and gender; managerial classes involved in educational reform and refunding at the cost of

remaining progressive educational democratic structures for children and teachers; education for mass ignorance and repression in technocratic and militarized culture; growing and-science mystery cults in dissendng and radical political movements; continued relative scientific illiteracy among white women and people of colour; growing industrial direction of education (especially higher education) by science-based multinationals (particularly in electronics- and biotechnology-dependent companies); highly educated, numerous elites in a progressively bimodal society.

Clinic-hospital: Intensified machine-body relations; renegotiations of public metaphors which channel personal experience of the body, particularly in relation to reproduction, immune system functions, and 'stress' phenomena; intensification of reproductive politics in response to world historical implications of women's unrealized, potential control of their relation to reproduction; emergence of new, historically specific diseases; struggles over meanings and means of health in environments pervaded by high technology products and processes; continuing feminization of health work; intensified struggle over state responsibility for health; continued ideological role of popular health movements as a major form of American politics.

Church: Electronic fundamentalist 'super-saver' preachers solemnizing the union of electronic capital and automated fetish gods; intensified importance of churches in resisting the militarized state; central struggle over women's meanings and authority in religion; continued relevance of spirituality, intertwined with sex and health, in political struggle.

The only way to characterize the informatics of domination is as a massive intensification of insecurity and cultural impoverishment, with common failure of subsistence networks for the most vulnerable. Since much of this picture interweaves with the social relations of science and technology, the urgency of a socialist-feminist politics addressed to science and technology is plain. There is much now being tione, and the grounds for political work are rich. For example, the efforts to develop forms of collecdve struggle for women in paid work, like SEIU's District 925,* should be a high priority for all of us. These efforts are profoundly deaf to technical restructuring of labour processes and reformations of working classes. These efforts also are providing understanding of a more comprehensive kind of labour organization, involving community, sexuality, and family issues never privileged in the largely white male industrial unions.

The structural rearrangements related to the social relations of science and technology evoke strong ambivalence. But it is not necessary to be uldmately depressed by the implications of late twentieth-century women's relation to all aspects of work, culture, production of knowledge, sexuality, and reproduction. For excellent reasons, most Marxisms see domination best and have trouble understanding what can only look like false consciousness and people's complicity in their own domination in late capitalism. It is crucial to remember that what is lost, perhaps especially from women's points of view, is often virulent forms of oppression, nostalgically naturalized in the face of current violation. Ambivalence towards the disrupted unides mediated by high-tech culture requires not sorting consciousness into categories of clear-sighted critique grounding a solid political epistemology'

*Service Employees International Union's office workers' organization in the US. versus 'manipulated false consciousness', but subtle understanding of emerging pleasures, experiences, and powers with serious potential for changing the rules of the game.

There are grounds for hope in the emerging bases for new kinds of unity across race, gender, and class, as these elementary units of socialist-feminist analysis themselves suffer protean transformations. Intensifications of hardship experienced world-wide in connection with the social relations of science and technology are severe. But what people are experiencing is not transparently clear, and we lack aufficiently subtle connections for collectively building effective theories of experience. Present efforts — Marxist, psychoanalytic, feminist, anthropological — to clarify even 'our' experience are rudimentary.

I am conscious of the odd perspecdve provided by my historical position — a PhD in biology for an Irish Catholic girl was made possible by Sputnik's impact on US national science-education policy. I have a body and mind as much constructed by the post-Second World War arms race and cold war as by the women's movements. There are more grounds for hope in focusing on the contradictory effects of politics designed to produce loyal American technocrats, which also produced large numbers of dissidents, than in focusing on the present defeats.

The permanent pardality of feminist points of view has consequences for our expectations of forms of political organization and participation. We do not need a totality in order to work well. The feminist dream of a common language, like all dreams for a perfectly true language, of perfectly faithful naming of experience, is a totalizing and imperialist one. In that sense, dialectics too is a dream language, longing to resolve contradiction. Perhaps, ironically, we can learn from our fusions with animals and machines how not to be Man, the embodiment of Western logos. From the point of view of pleasure in these potent and taboo fusions, made inevitable by the social relations of science and technology, there might indeed be a feminist science.

Cyborgs: a myth of political identity
I want to conclude with a myth about idendty and boundaries which might inform late twentieth-century political imaginations (Plate 1). I am indebted in this story to writers like Joanna Russ, Samuel R. Delany, John Varley, James Tiptree, Jr, Octavia Butler, Monique Wittig, and Vonda McIntyre.23 These are our story-tellers exploring what it means to be embodied in high-tech worlds. They are theorists for cyborgs. Exploring concephons of bodily boundaries and social order, the anthropologist Mary Douglas (1966, 1970) should be credited with helping us to consciousness about how fundamental body imagery is to world view, and so to political language.

French feminists like Luce Irigaray and Monique Wittig, for all their differences, know how to write the body; how to weave eroticism, cosmology, and politics from imagery of embodiment, and especially for Wittig, from imagery of fragmentation and reconstitution of bodies.24

American radical feminists like Susan Griffnn, Audre Lorde, and Adrienne Rich have profoundly affected our political imaginations — and perhaps restricted too much what we allow as a friendly body and political language.25 They insist on the organic, opposing it to the technological. But their symbolic systems and the related positions of ecofeminism and feminist paganism, replete with organicisms, can only be understood in Sandoval's terms as oppositional ideologies fitting the late twentieth century. They would simply bewilder anyone not preoccupied with the machines and consciousness of late capitalism. In that sense they are part of the cyborg world. But there are also great riches for feminists in explicitly embracing the possibilides inherent in the breakdown of clean disdnctions between organism and machine and similar distinctions structuring the Western self. It is the simultaneity of breakdowns that cracks the matrices of domination and opens geometric possibilities. What might be learned from personal and political 'technological' pollution? I look briefly at two overlapping groups of texts for their insight into the construction of a potentially helpful cyborg myth: constructions of women of colour and monstrous selves in feminist science fiction.

Earlier I suggested that 'women of colour' might be understood as a cyborg idendty, a potent subjecdvity synthesized from fusions of outsider identities and in the complex political-historical layerings of her 'biomythography', Zami (Lorde, 1982; King, 1987a, 1987b). There are material and cultural grids mapping this potential, Audre Lorde (1984) captures the tone in the title of her Sister Outsider. In my political myth, Sister Outsider is the offshore woman, whom US workers, female and feminized, are supposed to regard as the enemy prevendug their solidarity, threatening their security. Onshore, inside the boundary of the United States, Sister Outsider is a potential amidst the races and ethnic identities of women manipulated for division, competition, and exploitation in the same industries. 'Women of colour' are the preferred labour force for the science-based industries, the real women for whom the world-wide sexual market, labour market, and politics of reproduction kaleidoscope into daily life. Young Korean women hired in the sex industry and in electronics assembly are recruited from high schools, educated for the integrated circuit. Literacy, especially in English, distinguishes the 'cheap' female labour so attractive to the multinationals.

Contrary to orientalist stereotypes of the 'oral primidve', literacy is a special mark of women of colour, acquired by US black women as well as men through a history of risking death to learn and to teach reading and wridng. Writing has a special significance for all colonized groups. Writing has been crucial to the Western myth of the distinction between oral and written cultures, primitive and civilized mentalities, and more recently to the erosion of that distinction in 'postmodernist' theories attacking the phallogo-centrism of the West, with its worship of the monotheistic, phallic, authoritative, and singular work, the unique and perfect name.26 Contests for the meanings of writing are a major form of contemporary political struggle. Releasing the play of writing is deadly serious. The poetry and stories of US women of colour are repeatedly about writing, about access to the power to signify; but this dme that power must be neither phallic nor innocent. Cyborg writing must not be about the Fall, the imagination of a once-upon-a-time wholeness before language, before writing, before Man. Cyborg writing is about the power to survive, not on the basis of original innocence, but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark the world that marked them as other.

The tools are often stories, retold stories, versions that reverse and displace the hierarchical dualisms of naturalized identities. In retelling origin stories, cyborg authors subvert the central myths of origin of Western culture. We have all been colonized by those origin myths, with their longing for fulfilment in apocalypse. The phallogocentrie origin stories most crucial for feminist cyborgs are built into the literal technologies — teehnologies that write the world, biotechnology and microelectronics — that have recently textualized our bodies as code problems on the grid of C3I. Feminist cyborg stories have the task of recoding communication and intelligence to subvert command and control.

Figuratively and literally, language politics pervade the struggles of women of colour; and stories about language have a special power in the rich contemporary writing by US women of colour. For example, retellings of the stom~ of the indigenous woman Malinche, mother of the mesdzo 'bastard' race of the new world, master of languages, and mistress of Cortes, carry special meaning for Chicana constructions of identity. Cherrie Moraga (1983) in Loving in the War Years explores the themes of identity when one never possessed the original language, never told the original story, never resided in the harmony of legitimate heterosexuality in the garden of culture, and so cannot base identity on a myth or a fall from innocence and right to natural names, mother's or father's.27 Moraga's writing, her superb literacy, is presented in her poetry as the same kind of violation as Malinche's mastery of the conqueror's language — a violation, an illegitimate production, that allows survival. Moraga's language is not 'whole'; it is self-consciously spliced, a chimera of English and Spanish, both conqueror's languages. But it is this chimeric monster, without claim to an original language before violation, that crafts the erode, competent, potent identities of women of colour. Sister Outsider hints at the possibility of world survival not because of her innocence, but because of her ability to live on the boundaries, to write without the founding myth of original wholeness, with its inescapable apocalypse of final return to a deathly oneness that Man has imagined to be the innocent and all-powerful Mother, freed at the End from another spiral of appropriation by her son. Writing marks Moraga's body, affirms it as the body of a woman of colour, against the possibility of passing into the unmarked category of the Anglo father or into the orientalist myth of 'original illiteracy' of a mother that never was. Malinche was mother here, not Eve before eating the forbidden fruit. Writing affirms Sister Outsider, not the Woman-before-the-Fall-into-Writing needed by the phallogocentric Family of Man.

Writing is pre-eminently the technology of cyborgs, etched surfaces of the late twentieth century. Cyborg politics is the struggle for language and the struggle against perfect communication, against the one code that translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism. That is why cyborg politics insist on noise and advocate pollution, rejoicing in the illegitimate fusions of animal and machine. These are the couplings which make Man and Woman so problematic, subverting the structure of desire, the force imagined to generate language and gender, and so subverting the structure and modes of reproduction of 'Western' idendty, of nature and culture, of mirror and eye, slave and master, body and mind. 'We' did not originally choose to be cyborgs, but choice grounds a liberal politics and epistemology that imagines the reproduction of individuals before the wider replications of 'texts'.

From the perspective of cyborgs, freed of the need to ground politics in 'our' privileged position of the oppression that incorporates all other dominations, the innocence of the merely violated, the ground of those closer to nature, we can see powerful possibilities. Feminisms and Marxisms have run aground on Western epistemological imperatives to construct a revolutionary subject from the perspective of a hierarchy of oppressions and/or a latent position of moral superiority, innocence, and greater closeness to nature. With no available original dream of a common language or original symbiosis promising protection from hostile 'masculine' separation, but written into the play of a text that has no finally privileged reading or salvation history, to recognize 'oneself' as fully implicated in the world, frees us of the need to root politics in identification, vanguard parties, purity, and mothering. 

Stripped of identity, the bastard race teaches about the power of the margins and the importance of a mother like Malinche. Women of colour have transformed her from the evil mother of masculinist fear into the originally literate mother who teaches survival.

This is not just literary deconstruction, but liminal transformation. Every, story that begins with original innocence and privileges the return to wholeness imagines the drama of life to be individuation, separation, the birth of the self, the tragedy of autonomy, the fall into writing, alienation; that is, war, tempered by imaginary respite in the bosom of the Other. These plots are ruled by a reproductive politics — rebirth without flaw, perfection, abstraction. In this plot women are imagined either better or worse off, but all agree they have less selflhood, weaker individuation, more fusion to the oral, to Mother, less at stake in masculine autonomy. But there is another route to having less at stake in masculine autonomy, a route that does not pass through Woman, Primitive, Zero, the Mirror Stage and its imaginaw. It passes through women and other present-tense, illegitimate cyborgs, not of Woman born, who refuse the ideological resources of victimization so as to have a real life. These cyborgs are the people who refuse to disappear on cue, no matter how many dmes a 'western' commentator remarks on the sad passing of another primitive, another organic group done in by 'Western' technology, by writing.28 These real-life cyborgs (for example, the Southeast Asian village women workers inJapanese and US electronics firms described by Aihwa Ong) are actively rewriting the texts of their bodies and sociedes. Sumival is the stakes in this play of readings.

To recapitulate, certain dualisms have been persistent in Western traditions; they have all been systemic to the logics and practices of domination of women, people of colour, nature, workers, animals — in short, domination of all constituted as others, whose task is to mirror the self. Chief among these troubling dualisms are self/other, mind/body, culture/nature, male/female, civilized/primitive, reality/appearance, whole/part, agent/resource, maker/ made, active/passive, right/wrong, truth/illusion, totaVpartial, God/man. The self is the One who is not dominated, who knows that by the semice of the other, the other is the one who holds the future, who knows that by the experience of domination, which gives the lie to the autonomy of the self. To be One is to be autonomous, to be powerful, to be God; but to be One is to be an illusion, and so to be involved in a dialectic of apocalypse with the other. Yet to be other is to be multiple, without clear boundary, frayed, insubstantial. One is too few, but two are too many.

High-tech culture challenges these dualisms in intriguing ways. It is not clear who makes and who is made in the relation between human and machine. It is not clear what is mind and what body in machines that resolve into coding practices. In so far as we know ourselves in both formal discourse (for example, biology) and in daily practice (for example, the homework economy in the integrated circuit), we find ourselves to be cyborgs, hybrids, mosaics, chimeras. Biological organisms have become biotic systems, communications devices like others. There is no fundamental, ontological separation in our formal knowledge of machine and organism, of technical and organic. The replicant Rachel in the Ridley Scott film Blade Runner stands as the image of a cyborg culture's fear, love, and confusion.

One consequence is that our sense of connection to our tools is heightened. The trance state experienced by many computer users has become a staple of science-fiction film and cultural jokes. Perhaps paraplegics and other severely handicapped people can (and sometimes do) have the most intense experiences of complex hybridization with other communication devices.29 Anne McCaffrey's pre-feminist The Ship Who Sang (1969) explored the consciousness of a cyborg, hybrid of girl's brain and complex machinery, formed after the birth of a severely handicapped child. Gender, sexuality, embodiment, skill: all were reconstituted in the story. Why should our bodies end at the skin, or include at best other beings encapsulated by skin? From the seventeenth century dll now, machines could be animated — given ghostly souls to make them speak or move or to account for their orderly development and mental capacides. Or organisms could be mechan-ized — reduced to body understood as resource of mind. These machine/ organism relationships are obsolete, unnecessary. For us, in imagination and in other practice, machines can be prosthetic devices, intimate components, friendly selves. We don't need organic holism to give impermeable whole-ness, the total woman and her feminist variants (mutants?). Let me conclude this point by a very partial reading of the logic of the cyborg monsters of my second group of texts, feminist science fiction.

The cyborgs populating feminist science fiction make very problematic the statuses of man or woman, human, artefact, member of a race, individual endty, or body. Katie King clarifies how pleasure in reading these fictions is not largely based on idendfication. Students facingJoanna Russ for the first time, students who have learned to take modernist writers like James Joyce or Virginia Woolf without flinching, do not know what to make of The Adventures of Alyx or The Female Man, where characters refuse the reader's search for innocent wholeness while granting the wish for heroic quests, exuberant eroticism, and serious politics. The Female Man is the story of four versions of one genotype, all of whom meet, but even taken together do not make a whole, resolve the dilemmas of violent moral action, or remove the growing scandal of gender. The feminist science fiction of Samuel R. Delany, especially Tales of Neveyon, mocks stories of origin by redoing the neolithic revolution, replaying the founding moves of Western civilization to subvert their plausibility. 
James Tiptree, Jr, an author whose fiction was regarded as particularly manly undl her 'true' gender was revealed, tells tales of reproduction based on non-mammalian technologies like alternation of generations of male brood pouches and male nurturing. John Varley constructs a supreme cyborg in his arch-feminist exploration of Gaea, a mad goddess-planet-trickster-old woman-technological device on whose surface an extraordinary array of post-cyborg symbioses are spawned. Octavia Butler writes of an African sorceress pithug her powers of transformation against the genetic manipulations of her rival (Wild Seed), of dme warps that bring a modern US black woman into slavery where her actions in relation to her white master-ancestor determine the possibility of her own birth (Kindred), and of the illegidmate insights into idendty and community of an adopted cross-species child who came to know the enem' as self (Survivor). In Dawn (1987), the first instalment of a series called Xenogenesis, Butler tells the story of Lilith Iyapo, whose personal name recalls Adam's first and repudiated wife and whose family name marks her status as the widow of the son of Nigerian immigrants to the US. A black woman and a mother whose child is dead, Lilith mediates the transformation of humanity through genetic exchange with extra-terrestrial lovers/rescuers/destroyers/genetic engineers, who reform earth's habitats after the nuclear holocaust and coerce surviving humans into intimate fusion with them. It is a novel that interrogates reproductive, linguishc, and nuclear politics in a mythic field structured by late twentieth-century race and gender.

Because it is particularly rich in boundary transgressions, Vonda McIn-tyre's Superluminal can close this truncated catalogue of promising and dangerous monsters who help redefine the pleasures and politics of embodiment and feminist writing. In a fiction where no character is 'simply' human, human status is highly problematic. Orca, a genetically altered diver, can speak with killer whales and survive deep ocean conditions, but she longs to explore space as a pilot, necessitating bionic implants jeopardizing her kinship with the divers and cetaceans. Transformations are effected by virus vectors carrying a new developmental code, by transplant surgery, by implants of microelectronic devices, by analogue doubles, and other means. Lacnea becomes a pilot by accepting a heart implant and a host of other alterations allowing survival in transit at speeds exceeding that of light. Radu Dracul survives a virus-caused plague in his outerworld planet to find himself with a time sense that changes the boundaries of spatial perception for the whole species. All the characters explore the limits of language; the dream of communicating experience; and the necessity of limitation, partiality, and indmacy even in this world of protean transformation and connection. Superluminal stands also for the defining contradictions of a cyborg world in another sense; it embodies textually the intersection of feminist theory and colonial discourse in the science fiction I have alluded to in this chapter. This is a conjunction with a long history that many 'First World' feminists have tried to repress, including myself in my readings of Superluminal before being called to account by Zoe Sofoulis, whose different location in the world system's informatics of domin-ation made her acutely alert to the imperialist moment of all science fiction cultures, including women's science fiction. From an Australian feminist sensitivity, Sofoulis remembered more readily McIntyre's role as writer of the adventures of Captain Kirk and Spock in TV's Star Trek series than her rewriting the romance in Superluminal.

Monsters have always defined the limits of community in Western imaginations. The Centaurs and Amazons of ancient Greece established the limits of the centred polls of the Greek male human by their disruption of marriage and boundary pollutions of the warrior with animality and woman. Unseparated twins and hermaphrodites were the confused human material in early modern France who grounded discourse on the natural and supernatural, medical and legal, portents and diseases — all crucial to establishing modern identity.30 The evolutionary and behavioural sciences of monkeys and apes have marked the multiple boundaries of late twentieth-century industrial identities. Cyborg monsters in feminist science fiction define quite different political possibilities and limits from those proposed by the mundane fiction of Man and Woman.

There are several consequences to taking seriously the imagery of cyborgs as other than our enemies. Our bodies, ourselves; bodies are maps of power and identity. Cyborgs are no exception. A cyborg body is not innocent; it was not born in a garden; it does not seek unitary identity and so generate antagonistic dualisms without end (or until the world ends); it takes irony for granted. One is too few, and two is only one possibility. Intense pleasure in skill, machine skill, ceases to be a sin, but an aspect of embodiment. The machine is not an it to be animated, worshipped, and dominated. The machine is us, our processes, an aspect of our embodiment. We can be responsible for machines; they do not dominate or threaten us. We are responsible for boundaries; we are they. Up till now (once upon a time), female embodiment seemed to be given, organic, necessary; and female embodiment seemed to mean skill in mothering and its metaphoric exten-sions. Only by being out of place could we take intense pleasure in machines, and then with excuses that this was organic activity after all, appropriate to females. Cyborgs might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex and sexual embodiment. Gender might not be global identity after all, even if it has profound historical breadth and depth.

The ideologically charged question of what counts as daily activity, as experience, can be approached by exploiting the cyborg image. Feminists have recently claimed that women are given to dailiness, that women more than men somehow sustain daily life, and so have a privileged epistemo-logical position potentially. There is a compelling aspect to this claim, one that makes visible unvalued female activity and names it as the ground of life. But the ground of life? What about all the ignorance of women, all the exclusions and failures of knowledge and skill? What about men's access to daily competence, to knowing how to build things, to take them apart, to play? What about other embodiments? Cyborg gender is a local possibility taking a global vengeance. Race, gender, and capital require a cyborg theory of wholes and parts. There is no drive in cyborgs to produce total theory, but there is an intimate experience of boundaries, their construction and deconstruction. There is a myth system waiting to become a political language to ground one way of looking at science and technology and challenging the informatics of domination — in order to act potently.

One last image organisms and organismic, holistic politics depend on metaphors of rebirth and invariably call on the resources of reproductive sex. I would suggest that cyborgs have more to do with regeneration and are suspicious of the reproductive matrix and of most birthing. For salamanders, regeneration after injury, such as the loss of a limb, involves regrowth of structure and restoration of function with the constant possibility of twinning or other odd topographical productions at the site of former injury. The regrown limb can be monstrous, duplicated, potent. We have all been injured, profoundly. We require regeneration, not rebirth, and the possibilities for our reconstitution include the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous world without gender.

Cyborg imagery can help express two crucial arguments in this essay: first, the production of universal, totalizing theory is a major mistake that misses most of reality, probably always, but certainly now; and second, taking responsibility for the social relations of science and technology means refusing an anti-science metaphysics, a demonology of technology, and so means embracing the skilful task of reconstructing the boundaries of daily life, in partial connection with others, in communication with all of our parts. It is not just that science and technology are possible means of great human satisfaction, as well as a matrix of complex dominations. Cyborg imagery can suggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we have explained our bodies and our tools to ourselves. This is a dream not of a common language, but of a powerful infidel heteroglossia. It is an imagination of a feminist speaking in tongues to strike fear into the circuits of the supersavers of the new right. It means both building and destroying machines, identities, categories, relationships, space stories. Though both are bound in the spiral dance, I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess.

The last few weeks have been very difficult for women in tech:

1. GitHub posted a sloppy ‘investigations concluded’ report (their follow-up gives a better indication of what actually happened)
2.Gurbaksh Chahal - then-CEO of a startup, was allegedly video taped violently attacking a former partner 117 times in 30 mins (He was finally fired some time after this was made public)
3. People seemed to think it was fine to request the video in question without caring about the consent of the woman in the video — it was all about either exonerating or condemning the man involved.
4. codebabes.com was published (with a hilarious takedown by the amazing Meggan Blake, Simon O’Shea & others through codedicks.com)
5. Some men made statements that made us feel unwelcome in the tech industry.
A bunch of us - Sara, Ellen, Sabrina, Kat, Joanne, Angelina, Jessica, Jennifer, Divya - have been thinking about what this means for us.

This is not what we expected, we really just want to work on what we love.

We happen to be humans who loved technology and embrace it wholeheartedly. But it was always clear things would be different if we were male.

Some of us identified as feminists before we came to this industry. Some of us only began to understand the relevance of feminism as we sought to understand what’s been happening to us. Some of us felt that we didn't need the programs and events geared specifically towards women— until the bad stuff started happening to us. We thought they did more harm than help by calling attention to our gender, and we wondered what others were complaining about. It was hard to see until we suffered also.

Others, still, speak very much of feminist ideals and action but are afraid to identify with the word ‘feminist’ because they fear alienation from their peers, both in work and also in their social lives.

Feminism is not a dirty word. Feminism is the radical notion that women are people, and that we want to be treated as equals. Don’t let someone else pretend otherwise out of their own misguided notions.

The last thing we want is for people reading this to be put on the defensive. What we want most is for people to read and understand what death by a thousand cuts feels like, and then understand why we feel sad and angry at the tech industry. We also want you to understand that more still needs to be done.

Our experiences? They’re just like the stories you hear about.

But maybe you thought because we weren’t as loud, that this stuff doesn’t happen to us.

We've been harassed on mailing lists and called ‘whore’/‘cunt’ without any action being taken against aggressors.

We get asked about our relationships at interviews, and we each have tales of being groped at public events. We’ve been put in the uncomfortable situation of having men attempt to turn business meetings into dates.

We've found casual assumptions that point at more significant issues. We've witnessed the few female co-workers and male allies we’ve had get fired or bullied into leaving — at companies that had so few of them to begin with.

We're constantly asked ‘if you write any code” when speaking about technical topics and giving technical presentations, despite just having given a talk on writing code. We've been harassed at these same conferences in person and online about our gender, looks, and technical expertise.

We get asked if we’re the event planner or executive assistant on a regular basis.

We regularly receive creepy, rapey e-mails where men describe what a perfect wife we would be and exactly how we should expect to be subjugated. Sometimes there are angry e-mails that threaten us to leave the industry, because ‘it doesn’t need anymore c**ts ruining it’.

We have watched companies say that diversity is of highest importance and have invited us to advise them. After we donate much of our time they change nothing, do nothing, and now wear speaking to us as a badge of honor. Stating, “We tried!”.

We've grown cynical of companies creating corporate programs and paying lip service to focusing on women’s issues in the tech industry without understanding the underlying reality. We've experienced a staggering earnings gap in our field, which, being freelance and project-based, makes it challenging to ascribe blame. We've been told repeatedly that accomplishments were due to our gender and our role as the ""token woman"".

Why we're writing this thing:

We love working in this industry.

We love collaborating with like-minded colleagues.

We can’t give up and leave.

We’d rather be writing blog posts about best practices for development, design, and tech management instead of the one we’re writing now.

We are tired of pretending this stuff doesn’t happen and continue to keep having these experiences again and again. We keep our heads down working at our jobs hoping that if we just work hard at what we do, maybe somehow the problem will go away.

Okay! I know it’s bad but I don’t do any bad things.

We are tired of our male peers pretending that because they do not participate in bad behavior, that it is not their problem to solve. If you see someone engage in bad behavior and you do nothing, you’ve chosen to let that person think that what they did is okay. This leaves us feeling like we’re fighting this alone. We can’t work on what we can’t see, but if you’re there when it happens, you can help. It is absolutely imperative that men work with other men to combat bad attitudes and behavior.

You might be surprised how few people want to help or engage on this still.

Imagine if you were the only person like you on your team and when you left your computer and came back there was very graphic porn on your screen (a specific example that we have experienced). Knowing that saying you were uncomfortable would alienate you from the rest of your team even more than you already were; knowing that you would no longer get the mentorship from the senior staff that was involved in these disgusting pranks, would you dare to talk about how it made you feel?

We feel powerless as we have no recourse when these things happen to us. Power dynamics in the workplace are a real thing, and we all know it.

This is what happens to people that are uncomfortable and speak up.

Our industry is filled with very smart people. We know that you know how to find the answers to questions you have and also how to challenge an opinion or action you disagree with. Take that same passion that you would apply to technical problems, and apply it to social ones.

  
We are not the 'nice feminists' of this community.

Being nice doesn’t work. We’ve been nice. Some of us that wrote these have even been paraded around by men in the industry for how nice we’ve been in trying to address the social problems in tech as a way to discredit more vocal, astutely firm feminist voices. We don’t like this, we’ve never liked it, and it needs to stop.

Being nice and talking politely about injustice does not compel the group in power to do anything that unseats their power.

We will call out injustice when we see it. We will speak up when we get private abusive emails from prominent males in tech (who sound sincere online to help the cause of women in tech), indulging in ‘harmless’ sexist jokes. We will speak up when people on forums or GitHub make remarks that prevent us from forwarding the conversation just because we happen to identify as women.

While not all of us might use the type of language and rhetoric that is often maligned as ‘too angry’ in our community, we are just as angry. There are people in our community who are speaking hard truths, and we need to listen - that means you too. There is work to be done.

Does this mean we’re going to get angry at you if you try to help and get it wrong?

This is a fear that has come to light through side channels. Men know there is a problem, and they’re worried the women they know are on the defensive - especially when reading a direct call to action like this one.

They want to help but they’re worried if they don’t get everything just right, someone will chastise them into oblivion.

The people signing this document are patient when they see someone trying to make a difference. We might offer feedback but we’re not going to make someone feel bad because they didn’t get it right. If you’re listening to and doing what women suggest to help solve the problems, it’s pretty hard to get someone angry at you for ‘doing it wrong’. If you come up with your own interpretation of how to fix things and you’re not a woman in tech with these problems, you are way more likely to mess it up.

Promote the fuck out of diversity: and go beyond women, too.

Encouraging greater diversity in the workspace is not lip-service to morality. It leads to a better work environment. With time, the benefits of building a diverse team will become increasingly obvious. We want to give voice to the people and organizations that are making change today instead of waiting for it to happen tomorrow.

Kat has started organizing casual lightning talks featuring female speakers. The talks have now taken place in both San Francisco and New York.

Julie Ann Horvath started Passions Projects, a series of longer talks showcasing one female technologist at a time.

Allison House, Laura Brunow Miner, Alice Lee, Carrie Paton, and The Designer Fund organize “Origins” — a series of events celebrating women in design.

Jen Myers hosts virtual office hours to mentor women in public speaking.

Square recently organized College Code Camp, a four-day immersion program for women pursuing a technical degree at a U.S. or Canadian university. If you know a currently enrolled student, encourage her to apply.

Allison House and Brian Bailey both wrote about and recognized talented minority designers that are typically overlooked.

Model View Culture is a women owned and operated publication that elevates the voices of underrepresented groups in technology.

TheLi.st and Change the Ratio aim to increase visibility and access for women and underrepresented groups in technology.

Hackbright, Girls Who Code, Girl Develop It , and Black Girls Code are all organizations dedicated to educating and preparing young girls, women, and minority women for jobs in the tech industry. Coder Dojo is a free and accessible coding club for kids that runs 412 programs on an annual budget of $2,000.

Donate your time and volunteer at one of these organizations. If you don’t have time then donate your money, and if you don’t have money then donate your influence by promoting these institutions and their students.

We want you to know it is cool to strive to work towards diversity in general. We want you to know there are amazing folks taking brave actions that are leading to striking results. If you have experienced differences because of efforts to get diverse folks be part of your team, reach out to us— We would love to hear more and get others to hear about your experience.

While this letter speaks specifically about our experiences as women in tech, to build true diversity in tech we must address more than one aspect of gender, more than any one aspect of our identities. Our efforts must address, and be inclusive of, race, class, sexuality, gender identity and expression, and their intersections. We need to be here for everybody.

To others in our industry:

We encourage you to talk to us. All of us are here to support you if you feel held back because of who you identify yourself as, rather than what you do. While we encourage you to speak out, if you want someone to talk to about the how and what and whys of doing so, we will help you. If you don’t want to speak out but you need to relate and have some support in your network, nobody will judge you poorly for that and we are here for that too.

If you feel like you are an exception and you don’t understand these issues, this does not mean there are no problems. Nobody should have to ‘tough it out’, either. If you feel unaffected then use your position and energy to help others that are affected.

Sharing these stories helped us see we were not alone and our experiences were valid. It is perfectly reasonable to ask for safe, respectful working environments. We have a network in each other.

We are your community leaders, your open source contributors, your keynote speakers, and many call us role models.

We choose to speak now.

The Indie Web Manifesto

IN ENGLISH

par le minirézo
 

The indie web, it’s these thousands of websites delivering millions of pages, built up with passion, opinions and information by Net users assuming their rights as citizens. The indie web is a new type of link between people, it’s a free and open space of shared knowledge where vanity has no place.

While commercial websites display more and more agressive messages, target and track their users, the indie web respects the individuals, their intelligence and their privacy; it’s an open forum for thoughts and debate. While purely commercial websites turn into information and entertainment magazines, while tycoons of media, telecom, computing and military agencies fight for the control of the Internet, the indie web offers a free vision of the world, bypasses the economic censorship of news, its confusion with advertising and infommercial, its reduction to a dazing and manipulating entertainment.

Yet the existence of an independent and goodwill-based web is endangered: threatened by the never-ending technology race which makes the websites more difficult and expensive to set up, by the overwhelming commercial advertising pressure, and soon by dissymetric networks, Network Computers, proprietary networks, broadcasting, all aiming at the transformation of the citizen into a basic consumer. The computer press, so greedy for advertising coming from companies who make their profit out of the great wealth of the free indie web, is only fascinated by the technical and economical challenges of the Internet and has deliberatly decided to pass over its cultural dimension in the silence: magazines announce shortly the death of pioneer websites and basically never write more than a couple of lines about independent initiatives in comparison with the full-feature articles about any soap vendors new sites. According to them, creating one’s own site is a pathetic and secondary initiative compared to all the opportunities offered by online commerce.

We invite the users to realize the essential role they play on the Internet: when they start their own website, when they send comments, criticisms or warm letters to the webmasters, when they exchange tips and hints in the newsgroups or by e-mail, they provide an independent and free source of information that others would like to sell and control. Education, information, culture and debate can only come from users, independent webmasters, academic or associative organizations.",<em>The Indie Web Manifesto</em>,,,,2014-08-14T16:51:17+00:00,4,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/4,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=96,96,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T14:06:32+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Open Access, Open Source",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/96

How journalism works today. Seventeen declarations.

1. The Internet is different.

It produces different public spheres, different terms of trade and different cultural skills. The media must adapt their work methods to today’s technological reality instead of ignoring or challenging it.  It is their duty to develop the best possible form of journalism based on the available technology. This includes new journalistic products and methods.

2. The Internet is a pocket-sized media empire.

The web rearranges existing media structures by transcending their former boundaries and oligopolies. The publication and dissemination of media contents are no longer tied to heavy investments. Journalism’s self-conception is—fortunately—being cured of its gatekeeping function. All that remains is the journalistic quality through which journalism distinguishes itself from mere publication.

3. The Internet is our society is the Internet.

Web-based platforms like social networks, Wikipedia or YouTube have become a part of everyday life for the majority of people in the western world. They are as accessible as the telephone or television. If media companies want to continue to exist, they must understand the lifeworld of today’s users and embrace their forms of communication. This includes basic forms of social communication: listening and responding, also known as dialog.

4. The freedom of the Internet is inviolable.

The Internet’s open architecture constitutes the basic IT law of a society which communicates digitally and, consequently, of journalism. It may not be modified for the sake of protecting the special commercial or political interests often hidden behind the pretense of public interest. Regardless of how it is done, blocking access to the Internet endangers the free flow of information and corrupts our fundamental right to a self-determined level of information.

5. The Internet is the victory of information.

Due to inadequate technology, media companies, research centers, public institutions and other organizations compiled and classified the world’s information up to now. Today every citizen can set up her own personal news filter while search engines tap into wealths of information of a magnitude never before known. Individuals can now inform themselves better than ever.

6. The Internet changes improves journalism.

Through the Internet, journalism can fulfill its social-educational role in a new way. This includes presenting information as an ever-changing, continual process; the forfeiture of print media’s inalterability is a benefit. Those who want to survive in this new world of information need a new idealism, new journalistic ideas and a sense of pleasure in exploiting this new potential.

7. The net requires networking.

Links are connections. We know each other through links. Those who do not use them exclude themselves from social discourse. This also holds for the websites of traditional media companies.

8. Links reward, citations adorn.

Search engines and aggregators facilitate quality journalism: they boost the findability of outstanding content over a long-term basis and are thus an integral part of the new, networked public sphere. References through links and citations—especially including those made without any consent or even remuneration of the originator—make the very culture of networked social discourse possible in the first place. They are by all means worthy of protection.

9. The Internet is the new venue for political discourse.

Democracy thrives on participation and freedom of information. Transferring the political discussion from traditional media to the Internet and expanding on this discussion by involving the active participation of the public is one of journalism’s new tasks.

10. Today’s freedom of the press means freedom of opinion.

Article 5 of the German Constitution does not comprise protective rights for professions or technically traditional business models. The Internet overrides the technological boundaries between the amateur and professional. This is why the privilege of freedom of the press must hold for anyone who can contribute to the fulfillment of journalistic duties. Qualitatively speaking, no differentiation should be made between paid and unpaid journalism, but rather, between good and poor journalism.

11. More is more – there is no such thing as too much information.

Once upon a time, institutions such as the church prioritized power over personal awareness and warned of an unsifted flood of information when the letterpress was invented. On the other hand were the pamphleteers, encyclopaedists and journalists who proved that more information leads to more freedom, both for the individual as well as society as a whole. To this day, nothing has changed in this respect.

12. Tradition is not a business model.

Money can be made on the Internet with journalistic content. There are many examples of this today already. Yet because the Internet is fiercely competitive, business models have to be adapted to the structure of the net. No one should try to abscond from this essential adaptation through policy-making geared to preserving the status quo. Journalism needs open competition for the best refinancing solutions on the net, along with the courage to invest in the multifaceted implementation of these solutions.

13. Copyright becomes a civic duty on the Internet.

Copyright is a cornerstone of information organization on the Internet. Originators’ rights to decide on the type and scope of dissemination of their contents are also valid on the net. At the same time, copyright may not be abused as a lever to safeguard obsolete supply mechanisms and shut out new distribution models or license schemes. Ownership entails obligations.

14. The Internet has many currencies.

Journalistic online services financed through adverts offer content in exchange for a pull effect. A reader’s, viewer’s or listener’s time is valuable. In the industry of journalism, this correlation has always been one of the fundamental tenets of financing. Other forms of refinancing which are journalistically justifiable need to be forged and tested.

15. What’s on the net stays on the net.

The Internet is lifting journalism to a new qualitative level. Online, text, sound and images no longer have to be transient. They remain retrievable, thus building an archive of contemporary history. Journalism must take the development of information, its interpretation and errors into account, i.e., it must admit its mistakes and correct them in a transparent manner.

16. Quality remains the most important quality.

The Internet debunks homogenous bulk goods. Only those who are outstanding, credible and exceptional will gain a steady following in the long run. Users’ demands have increased. Journalism must fulfill them and abide by its own frequently formulated principles.

17. All for all.

The web constitutes an infrastructure for social exchange superior to that of 20th century mass media: When in doubt, the “generation Wikipedia” is capable of appraising the credibility of a source, tracking news back to its original source, researching it, checking it and assessing it—alone or as part of a group effort. Journalists who snub this and are unwilling to respect these skills are not taken seriously by these Internet users. Rightly so. The Internet makes it possible to communicate directly with those once known as recipients—readers, listeners and viewers—and to take advantage of their knowledge. Not the journalists who know it all are in demand, but those who communicate and investigate.

12 Mar, 2014 On the 25th anniversary of the World Wide Web, these are some of my longform thoughts as I work towards formulating a manifesto for Indie Technology. Indie Technology is the heir to both the free software and open source movements. It is the antidote for the erosion of our fundamental freedoms in the post-Snowden era by companies like Google and Facebook that espouse the business model of corporate surveillance.

Philosophy vs architecture of the Web

Twenty-five years ago, the World Wide Web was philosophically conceived as an open, decentralised platform. Its goal was to provide universal access to information and democratise communication.

Unfortunately, although the philosophy of the Web was decentralised, its client/server-based architecture wasn’t.

The Web of today is dominated by centralised closed silos of information and functionality like Google and Facebook. This is not a bug or anomaly, it is the evolutionary symptom of the client/server-based architecture of the Web working as designed.

The architecture of the Web, in direct contradiction to its philosophy, has resulted in economies of scale for centralised systems and companies like Google and Facebook have exploited this very feature to reach their current scale and dominance.

The gluttony of venture-capital financing combined with the economies of scale afforded by the centralised client/server-based architecture of the Web have created the perfect habitat for companies like Google and Facebook — with their shared business model of mining the population at large for data — to thrive in.

Corporate surveillance

This business model of mining and monetising user data at global scale — or, corporate surveillance, as it is otherwise known — is today the dominant — but by no means the exclusive — business model of our technological landscape.

The business model of corporate surveillance is, today, one of the greatest threats to our privacy, civil liberties, and human rights. In other words, corporate surveillance is currently one of the greatest threats to the fundamental freedoms that we have come to enjoy in societies that adopted the principles of democracy and the ideals of the enlightenment. Beyond this, the data and intelligence gathered, kept, and analysed by these corporations has also enabled governments to carry out dragnet surveillance on a scale hitherto impossible and at relatively minor cost.

If we want to safeguard our privacy, civil liberties, and human rights, we must oppose both corporate surveillance and dragnet government surveillance. Although they are not equivalent, they both pose an existential threat to our fundamental freedoms. Furthermore, one (corporate surveillance) is a prerequisite to the other (dragnet government surveillance).

Whereas the corporations engaged in corporate surveillance have a vested interest in deflecting the issue onto the shoulders of governments, we must be vigilant to not let them shrink from their own responsibilities.

So, we must fight dragnet government surveillance.

So, we must fight corporate surveillance.

So, we must change those architectural characteristics of the Web that have made it so favourable to the evolution of closed silos of information and functionality and so favourable to the business model of corporate surveillance.

We must resolve the impedance mismatch between the philosophy of the Web and its architecture.

We must decentralise the architecture of the web to match its philosophy.

Or, simply, we must decentralise the Web.

Decentralise the Web

Not re-decentralise. Decentralise. The architecture of the Web was never decentralised to begin with.

We must build a new, decentralised, Web on the shoulders of the Internet. One that overlaps the centralised Web but is far more than it could ever be. Eventually, other layers of the Internet stack itself must also be decentralised. The Domain Name System, for example, via decentralised protocols like the ones pioneered by cryptocurrencies.

And yet, throughout all this, we must be pragmatic.

And yet, throughout all this, we must not break the Web that exists.

The Web, thus, will be progressively decentralised. The Internet, also.

We must build a peer-to-peer Web. An Indie Web. And we must build Indie Technologies to empower everyone with read/write access to the Indie Web.

We must do this because we cannot expect it of the Googles and the Facebooks of the world.

The revolution won’t be sponsored by Google

It is naïve at best and unforgivably reckless at worst to entrust the very entities responsible for creating the problem in the first place with formulating solutions to the problem. Doubly so when it is apparent that the only viable solutions clearly run contrary to their very reason for being — their business model.

The revolution will not be sponsored by the very entities that we are revolting against.

It is time to create alternatives to the dinosaurs of Web 2.0 who have betrayed our trust and created the world of corporate surveillance — and, by extension, dragnet government surveillance — that we find ourselves living in.

This is not a battle that will be won at the infrastructure level or within the enterprise.

This battle will be fought, lost or won in the consumer market.

Open must win the consumer market

The new open tools we need to create are consumer tools.

Our new tools must compete successfully with their closed counterparts to empower people in both the immediacy of the moment — in our everyday experiences of and interactions with the world, people, and objects around us — and, as importantly, in the long-term with regards to our privacy, civil liberties, and human rights.

Thirty years ago, the free software movement revolutionised the world. Twenty years ago, open source made it accessible and palatable to businesses.

Today, the challenge for the next evolution of free and open source is to make open technologies accessible to consumers.

Today, our greatest challenge is how to make open technologies accessible to consumers. This is not a simple problem to solve. On the contrary, it is a very difficult one, the full implications of which a great portion of our community has not even begun to grasp.

Open does not mean accessible

We will begin by acknowledging that even though a thing is open, it is not necessarily accessible to every audience.

We will acknowledge that solutions created for one specific audience do not also magically become viable solutions for every audience. We cannot perpetuate a culture wherein enthusiasts create solutions for other enthusiasts with the latent expectation that they will also constitute usable solutions for consumers. This is the theory of Trickle-Down Technology. And we have thirty years of empirical data to show that it works about as well as the theory of trickle-down economics.

We will acknowledge that while free and open source products have achieved great success at the infrastructure level and in the enterprise over the last thirty years, they have been an abject and utter failure in consumer products.

We will acknowledge that the reason that free and open source products have failed in the consumer market is because we have, either unconsciously or otherwise, harboured under a theory of Trickle-Down Technology to create products that have been features-led in development process, and feature-rich, and experience-poor in character.

Open must compete on user experience

We acknowledge that the consumer market is not a market of features but a market of experience. The consumer market is a market where most products have feature-parity and where the differentiating factor is user experience.

We will acknowledge that even though the user experience of decentralised systems is not an easy problem to solve, our business model has an inherent user experience advantage when compared to the business model of corporate surveillance. Whereas the goals of companies like Google and Facebook are orthogonal to their users’ needs, our needs are perfectly aligned with the needs of our users: to simply provide the best user experience possible.

Finally, we will acknowledge that consumers will not use our products simply because they are open.

We cannot make ‘open’ or ‘private’ the unique selling point of our products. We must make products that work beautifully and are a joy to use so that they can compete successfully on user experience with their closed counterparts. If we do not, or if we cannot, we might as well accept that we have lost this battle and resign ourselves to the eventual inevitability of living in a world defined by the monopoly of a single business model and devoid of the fundamental freedoms that we take for granted today.

Needless to say, we categorically reject such a future.

Needless to say, we will — as difficult as it may be — acknowledge the above points so that we can change the status quo and create a new category of technology to counter the closed silos on the only battlefield that matters.

We will do this by bringing design thinking to open source and rejecting the old philosophy of features-led open source development.

We will do this by creating experience-driven open products.

We will do this by creating new organisations that are driven by design. Organisations where the roles of design and development are seen as facets of the same cyclical, iterative process of making assumptions, implementing them, and testing them.

We will do this by creating a new category of technology. A hitherto missing quadrant of technology.

Indie Technology

This new category of technology is called Indie Technology.

It is time to remove the impedance mismatch between the philosophy of the Web and its architecture. It is time to challenge the status quo of the closed silos that threaten the very future of our privacy, civil liberties, and human rights. It is time to build beautiful, open alternatives to the consumer products of the corporate surveillance business model to empower everyone — not just an elite subculture of enthusiasts — to own their own tools, data, services, and connectivity.

It is time to unshackle the Internet from the chains of its centralisation and the short-term greed of Silicon Valley’s vapid cycle of venture-capital-and-exit-strategy-sponsored erosion of our privacy, civil liberties, and human rights.

It is time for Indie Technology.

These are my longform thoughts, mostly unedited, and very much in outline form. I am working to distill and refine them. I would appreciate any feedback you may have. Please send your thoughts via email to aral@aralbalkan.com. Thank you.

today = new Date ();

once again, it's the future that's being sacrificed ...

i live in a strange house i have dreamed,

where, perhaps, i have died

 
Did something happen, and did I, because I didn't know how to experience it, 
end up experiencing something else instead?
Howls for a ruined universe. Wild architecture. 
Waves of seething code washing away the final traces of Big Browser.

Or perhaps I witnessed extravagant gifts being exchanged in the street of little girls?

There is no way of knowing which way to look any more, which way to move your body in order to hear properly.

Your secret has also become my secret. It's part of me, and I'll treat it as I do all my secrets -
I'll get rid of it when the time comes. 
Then it will become someone else's secret.

It's better to change friends than ideas.

Art begins, grows and disappears because frustrated cunts bypass the world of official expression and the festivals of its poverty.

The imaginary is that which tends to become real.

If I start from any meaning, I exhaust it . . . or eventually I fall upon meaninglessness.

Continuity is also a delusion.

Why bother?

We are not normal.

The future fills you in with a question.
A real underground is invisible, it's impossible to define it, 
because it's feeding back all the time, it's constantly changing.

Plagiarism is necessary. Progress implies it.

We all left when we couldn't steal anything anymore.

The revolution has already taken place in me. I am outside your world and no longer governed by your laws.
Laws are made by men who fuck their daughters. All history is pornography.

All women are ghosts and should rightly be feared.

I approach poetry: but only to miss it.

I drift. Principally I drift. One day we'll build cities for drifting.

Now comes the Time for Contempt. 
Now is the time for filth. 

Quick! Question everything.

We are living in an age where millions of colours became 256. Difference is the enemy. Generic culture hypnotises us all into generic patterns, where control is visibly invisible. Danger is replaced by fear. New means upgrade. Risk is obsolete. Art made money stupid, and money made us fools. We welcome no_use, no_function and no_fear. Anarchy, crash and burn, the new awaits.

From Learning to Earning, and now to Yearning, we have forgotten why we are here. We have lost touch with what made us tick, the fire of creative possibility that once consumed us from within.

Revolutionary thought is but a distant memory. I grew up as part of a generation that thought it could help improve society; that our sole function was to be conscious and to spread that consciousness through creative awareness, exploration, observation and questioning.

This generation was replaced by the Thatcher/Reagan paradigm of Culture=Money. Thinkers became earners, Creatives became entertainers, and a whole dumbed-down generation now feels entitled to success and profit without having to work or think too much.

We are now left with a spiritual hollowness. The belief systems of consumption and commodity have been exposed as empty. Revolution is a distant echo lost in the white noise, and religion has been largely subsumed by globalisation. Virtual experiences have replaced human touch. Analogue culture is now the exotic.

We have managed to create for our children, perhaps for the first time in history, a future which is less hopeful than the one we live in today.

DEEP FREEZE

The house of credit cards has now collapsed. For 25 years we have been in a state of Deep Freeze. We have somehow denied ourselves permission to remember what it was like before the Big Bang of banking deregulation. Schools became businesses and hospitals became profit centres. Art for art’s sake was sacrificed for entertainment and bums on seats. Ideas became clichŽs and anything different was viewed with suspicion and disdain.

We have traded Freedom for Peace. What we need is Liberation.

FREE ME FROM FREEDOM

As the Lehman Brothers collapsed, so a new era is signalled and the baton is passed on again. Mankind has the opportunity now to reclaim the cultural high-ground and risk something new, a creative breach in the barrier of exclusion that can allow some real growth and evolution, like a bright light shining through the cracks of a crumbling wall.

The line of Dangerous Ideas had been interrupted and the path can be found again.

The Manifesto…
We’ve tried to ignore the problem… I tried to ignore the problem. I wanted to ignore the politics of the internet and, in many ways, politics itself. From a netizen point of view, Democracy often seems inefficient and ineffectual. But just because WE want to ignore it, doesn’t mean politics wants to ignore us.

There are many groups who would subjugate us if they could. They would force us to pay every time we heard a song on the car radio, they would make sure we can’t speak freely about their brand or their brand of government, they would exert complete control over our online existence.

As Netizens, we naively think that calmer heads will prevail and this has often been the case… but laws like SOPA and PIPA, which could potentially make the Patriot Act look tame if used to their fullest extent… continue to be paid for by big industry and pushed through congress. These acts are not just bad, they are unAmerican and more akin to something we would see in China or Iran… not here.

How does this happen? It’s simple enough, Congressmen are paid to make laws that would oppress us. In the emerging world, this would be called “Corruption”… here it’s called “Contribution”. It’s easy. These laws are complicated and their most of their constituents don’t even know that their congressmen are involved or how these laws would affect them. The industries behind these laws are wealthy and spend lavishly on representatives willing to support them. Most importantly… there is little to no political pain for these representatives. They fill their campaign coffers with cash… if the bill fails, they keep the cash and it’s quickly forgotten. If the bill passes, they’ll get more money next year.

This needs to stop.

We can no longer expect our representatives, many of whom couldn’t write an email on their own, to represent us without firm action. We can no longer depend on OUR means of discussion – Facebook, Twitter, and Email -l to express ourselves.

We need to fight these laws, and the lawmakers that would pass them, in their back yard. We need to earn their respect, and fear if necessary. We need them to know that supporting these bills has a political cost.

We need a sort of “Internet Protection Fund”, a PAC, that is designed for a single purpose – To use every legal means to attack those who would attack us. To bring the fight to to their doorstep, their airwaves, and their TVs. We need to organize and focus the resistance.

Stop the SOPA and PIPA before they are passed through targeted boycotts, information campaigns, and letter writing campaigns.
Target those in Congress who support these bills and attempt to unseat them in the fall with internet, grassroots, TV and Radio campaigns. Congress needs to know that supporting these bills is no longer a blank check…it’s no longer safe.
We need to build our organization BETWEEN elections, build its resources, and build its capacity to defend our rights… aggressively. This fight is about to intensify as the information age matures. We need to begin to take an active role in shaping our online future.
This is not a replacement for organizations like the Electronic Freedom Foundation… without whom we will be already be in virtual chains. This is the sharp end of the stick that comes when they are not able to negotiate our freedom. These are the troops that back up the political discussions with real, tangible, action.

This is not a replacement for Anonymous. They play harder than we will. We will keep our fight within the confines of the current laws. We will use every means within those laws to express the will of those we represent but we will stay well within the confines of the current rules.

We will play by the political rules that our opponents play by… not the ones we wish they would play. We will use our skills, connections and ability to organize online but we will bring this fight to their field and beat them there.

So now what do we do?

Step one: +1 this post and pass it on. If there is enough interest, the next steps will be somewhat obvious (begin the organization structure). Comment and let me know what you think and what you would do next.

i dont want my words to be taken out of context 

i dont want to be infantilized because i refuse to be sexualized  

i dont want to be molested at shows or on the street by people who perceive me as an object that exists for their personal satisfaction 

i dont want to live in a world where im gonna have to start employing body guards because this kind of behavior is so commonplace and accepted and I’m pissed that when I express concern over my own safety it’s often ignored until people see firsthand what happens and then they apologize for not taking me seriously after the fact… 

I’m tired of men who aren’t professional or even accomplished musicians continually offering to ‘help me out’ (without being asked), as if i did this by accident and i’m gonna flounder without them.  or as if the fact that I’m a woman makes me incapable of using technology.  I have never seen this kind of thing happen to any of my male peers 

I’m tired of the weird insistence that i need a band or i need to work with outside producers (and I’m eternally grateful to the people who don’t do this)

im tired of being considered vapid for liking pop music or caring about fashion as if these things inherently lack substance or as if the things i enjoy somehow make me a lesser person 

im tired of being congratulated for being thin because i can more easily fit into sample sizes from the runway 

im tired of people i love betraying me so they can get credit or money

I’m sad that it’s uncool or offensive to talk about environmental or human rights issues

I’m tired of creeps on message boards discussing whether or not they’d “fuck” me

I’m tired of people harassing my dancers and treating them like they aren’t human beings

I’m sad that my desire to be treated as an equal and as a human being is interpreted as hatred of men, rather than a request to be included and respected (I have four brothers and many male best friends and a dad and i promise i do not hate men at all, nor do i believe that all men are sexist or that all men behave in the ways described above) 

im tired of being referred to as ‘cute,’ as a ‘waif’ etc., even when the author, fan, friend, family member etc. is being positive 

(fyi)

waif |wāf|

noun

1 a homeless and helpless person, esp. a neglected or abandoned child: she is foster-mother to various waifs and strays .

• an abandoned pet animal.

cute |kyo͞ot|

adjective

1 attractive in a pretty or endearing way: a cute kitten.

• informal sexually attractive.

I’m tired of people assuming that just because something happens regularly it’s ok

——————————————————

i have so much love for everyone who has been cool and amazing.  I have the best job in the world but I’m done with being passive about any kind of status quo that allows anyone to suffer or to be disrespected

Grimes world tour is officially over, the visions album cycle is officially over, and I’m now taking the time to overhaul everything and make it better 

much love to every fan - stuff can be lame sometimes but its really cool to have this support <3

March 28, 2013 

MOOCs are one of the hot topics in e-learning and Higher Education at the moment. The number of institutions designing their own MOOCs is growing exponentially and, thus, collective, academic reflection upon this new meme is required to guarantee we understand each other and we agree on some key issues concerning MOOCs.

The following manifesto is our contribution to that discussion. To see a Spanish version of this manifesto, please visit EducaconTIC.

MOOC Manifesto

1. In every teaching design, the learner is the centre. The same happens with MOOCs.

2. Taking into consideration the community of practice and the learning community the MOOC is aimed at is helpful for the MOOC design and for the MOOC institution itself. For instance, the digital competence of the learning community is one of the basic premises for the design of a MOOC.

3. There is no “standard” MOOC as there is no “standard” classroom o “standard” learning situation. MOOCs, as any other learning situation, are defined in design and action.

4.MOOCs must be an element within the digital strategy of an institution. MOOCs by themselves do not constitute a strategy.

5. Institutions may consider MOOCs basically as a branding instrument, although this reductionist approach which simplifies MOOC potential will only resist for a limited period of time. After that, MOOCs will only be relevant within a global institutional strategy linked to the commons and open knowledge.

6.The distinction between xMOOC and cMOOC is important for analysis and reflection. However, in fact it may be a question of connectivist scale. In certain institutions the move from MOOCs based on contents to task-based to connectivist MOOCs may be related to the different levels of digital competence of the learning community the institution must cater for.

7. Many educational institutions are geographically based; however, MOOCs are global: institutions must consider the global potential of MOOCs as an opportunity and as a possible threat.

8. Institutions may need to consider the prerequisites to enter a MOOC. However, institutions must consider too that preventing people from entering a MOOC may mean neglecting potential learning situations.

9. Open does not mean free. But it may. Considering the economical aspects of a MOOC is crucial for its sustainability.

10. MOOCs may be courses, or not. They certainly are learning experiences. MOOLE (Massive, Open, On-line Learning Experiences) would be a better acronym.

11. MOOCs can be an individualistic experience, a group experience or a cooperative experience. As in any other educational setting, cooperative learning is much more satisfactory than any other learning structure.

12. Group formation is as important in MOOCs as in any other learning experience and different forms of group structures and group tasks can be used at different moments in MOOCs.

13. Strong and weak social ties can contribute to deeper learning. Promoting socialization and networking across the MOOC enhances learning opportunities.

14. A MOOC is an opportunity for experimentation in curricular design. Designing a MOOC represents institutional learning-by-doing.

15. MOOCs are disruptive. Once an institution designs one, the whole list of courses of that institution is under question.

16. MOOCs question the conventional knowledge distribution in learning experiences. Multiple voices, belonging to MOOC designers, MOOC participants or occasional visitors, may co-occur from different levels of expertise and with different levels of implication.

17. MOOCs may follow a “learning route”, that is, a sequence of contents, tasks and tests. But they may also be a landscape to visit orderly or disorderly, randomly or purposely, alone or with other people, with or without guidance, for merely reading or watching or with action in mind.

18. The key for a MOOC is not which learning platform to use. That issue is basically relevant for the institution organizing the MOOC, but it is not a central topic for the learner nor should it be for the designer.

19. MOOCs open the debate but the debate takes place wherever participants decide, not where the designers may have established. Anyway, the more conversation, the better.

20. MOOC belongs to the macro-strategy. Content-curation and dynamization are the micro-strategy.

21. “Dynamization is the process of transforming a static data structure into a dynamic one.” (Wikipedia) That is the key to make MOOCs a social learning experience. Content curation is the way to provide access to relevant information to a large number of participants in a chaotic learning setting.

22. MOOCs take place on-line. That does not imply there may not be face-to-face, local learning encounters in parallel to the on-line learning experience.

23. Certificates are important for the educational (and labour) market. Certificates are not so important for learning and people interested in learning. MOOCs may cater for both needs.",<em>MOOC Manifesto</em>,,,,2014-08-17T16:19:20+00:00,6,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/6,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=105,105,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T14:03:36+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Digital Humanities, MOOCs, Online Teaching",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/105

A couple of months ago (on March 26, 2007) I did a talk at Moe's Books in Berkeley. The talk was built around an old manifesto that I dusted off, rewrote and added one point to. It's still a draft, and will likely undergo further change, but here goes:

I'll begin with my manifesto On the Virtues of Preexisting Material, which goes like this:

1 Why add to the population of orphaned works? 
2 Don't presume that new work improves on old 
3 Honor our ancestors by recycling their wisdom 
4 The ideology of originality is arrogant and wasteful 
5 Dregs are the sweetest drink
6 And leftovers were spared for a reason
7 Actors don't get a fair shake the first time around, let's give them another 
8 The pleasure of recognition warms us on cold nights and cools us in hot summers 
9 We approach the future by typically roundabout means 
10 We hope the future is listening, and the past hopes we are too
11 What's gone is irretrievable, but might also predict the future
12 Access to what's already happened is cheaper than access to what's happening now 
13 Archives are justified by use 
14 Make a quilt not an advertisement

- - - - - - - - -

No one loves manifestos more than their writers, which means that they often require interpretation and maybe even translation into real-world language. So what I'm going to do is take my 14 points and expand them into ideas. Some of these might sound trendy, but I think they're actually traditional — they've been in and around the culture for a long time.

1 Why add to the population of orphaned works? 

This is meant to provoke, of course. I might as well have asked, ""why make new work while old work still exists?"" That would be an argument for stasis, but I'm not seeking that — I'm seeking movement.

We live in a tremendously media-rich society. Every year Americans throw away more text, sound and image than most other nations create. We're the world capital of ephemera, and much of it has no active parent.

Orphaned works — which are works that are still owned by somebody, but a somebody that can't be found — testify to the absurdities that arise when products of the intellect are automatically born as property, which is the way our copyright law now reads. There are millions of orphaned works out there floating in limbo. You can reproduce them or work with them if you like, but if the derivative work you make rises above a certain horizon of obscurity, you run the risk of being sued. We are trying to come up with a better set of rules, but it's very difficult to change copyright law unless you run a studio or a record company. There are literally hundreds of thousands of great books we'd like to scan and put on the Net, but can't because of their orphan status.

The real issue, of course, is that we need to convene and decide how deeply we want to connect culture and property. And when we've settled on a particular mix, we might think about whether it maximizes our freedom to speak, to learn and to inquire — in short, whether it leads to the kind of a world we'd want to live in. This will not be an easy conversation — it's hardly even begun. But one way we can move towards more open cultural distribution and exchange is to make our own works as accessible as possible. We can do this by limiting restrictions on reuse to the absolute minimum, by using permissive licenses, like the Creative Commons licenses, that say ""use me this way, it's OK,"" and by using copyright homeopathically rather than as a weapon of shock and awe.

2 Don't presume that new work improves on old 

The ephemera we produce tend to manifest ideas that fix themselves over and over again in different media. What this suggests to me is that we might be more open to letting old works speak, that our task might not be so much to make new works but to build new platforms for old works to speak from. This might mean that we weave using others' threads, that we take positions as arrangers rather than as sculptors. 

Collage often does this. In recent years we have come to understand collage largely as an assembly of small units — as the equivalent of words, syllables or even phonemes. Collage has migrated from the arts and crafts we associate with folk culture into digital culture, speeding up and fragmenting along the way. Value-free, I want to propose that collage might also work in larger units, as sentences, paragraphs, chapters, even entire books. This kind of collage works slowly and in stealth, and will ultimately affect the way that we contrast new and old works.

3 Honor our ancestors by recycling their wisdom 

Take this with a grain of salt. I'm not good at ancestor worship and don't know if I'd recognize wisdom when it’s in front of me.

But I'm going to argue here against eternalizing the present. Just because we're in the middle of a condition that we call X doesn't mean it's always been X. Who would have thought that glaciers would start breaking up? Who could have predicted that honeybee populations would shrink? Who foresaw the breakup of the Soviet Union? And who among us recognizes that the 50 United States will grow to more or shrink to less than 50 as time passes?

Recycling the so-called wisdom of the past can problematize the present and encourage people to ask harder questions. When we inject history into contemporary experience, we are making an historical intervention, which can have dramatic consequences — if we listen.

This is why we've put ephemeral films online and why we're now scanning books, most of which weren't written by famous authors. 

4 The ideology of originality is arrogant and wasteful 

Many others have said this better than I can. It’s folly to make too much of originality. So much of what we make rests on work that's come before. Let's admit this and revel in it. Though it might make some people nervous, it actually cushions us in a genetic continuity of expression, and what could be more reassuring?

Last month, I went to a great lecture by Drew Daniel and Martin Schmidt from Matmos at the beautiful Hearst Mining Building. Drew laid out the history and promise of 1960s and 1970s conceptual art and talked about how it informed the work they do. One of the most provocative legacies of conceptual art was de-commodification — departing from object-oriented artmaking and from the tyranny of the art market. And yet it struck me that de-commodification had actually created its opposite. Conceptual works tended to exist primarily in their documentation, in physical traces of the work that had been created by someone so that the work would not disappear from consciousness. Documentation creates objects that are always someone's property. The value of art documentation rests in whose work it documents and in who made the documents. We are therefore almost back where we started.

When you attend a performance, a demonstration or a happening, count the cameras and recorders. What's the ratio of documentators to actors? Think of all the property that's being created on the back of an event that may be nobody's property, that may even be anti-property. Then think of identifying and unraveling those property rights forty years in the future.

5 Dregs are the sweetest drink 

My partner Megan and I run a research library in San Francisco that we built around our personal book, periodical and ephemera collections. At some point it got a life of its own and started growing like mushrooms in Mendocino. Many of you know it because you're our honored shelvers. We joke about how it's a library full of bad ideas; I characterize it as 98% false consciousness. It's full of outdated information, extinct procedures, self-serving explanations, ideas that never passed the smell test, and lies. And yet that's where you find the truth. You can't judge the past at its best, you need to confront its imperfections. And of course that's true for the present as well.

I've been interested in labor history for a long time, used to collect books about it, many of them from the old Moe's. When I began to collect industrial films I was struck by how much of the history of working people was contained in films made by corporations. In order to extract it you've got to engage in selective appropriation, but it's there, often eloquently so. There's a 1936 film called Master Hands which you can download from the Internet Archive; it’s a tribute to mass production at Chevrolet. But what it really shows is how elemental, dangerous and mind-numbing the work at Flint was. It's a film no one else seems to have, and it's now on the National Film Registry, but it was dregs — on a cold day in 1983, I paid a man not to throw it away.

Research is now indicating that kids who grow up on farms have fewer allergies later in life. The hypothesis is that exposure to manure immunizes them early on. City kids miss out. I hope you'll all come visit the library, get your own dose of bad ideas and build up your immune system.

6 And leftovers were spared for a reason 

Leftovers exist for lots of reasons, but my favorite reason is that they're our raw material for performing operations on history. Whether it's an individual filtering their family's reality through a scrapbook or a marcher carrying a picture of a prisoner at Abu Ghraib, people use what's left to us as leverage to document history or even change it.

7 Actors don't get a fair shake the first time around, let's give them another 

I don't know much about actors, really, and I'm not going to take you through the ""long tail"" argument. But I think that reincarnation through reuse confers importance, greater recognition, and respect on works and those who make them. Does it bring the makers money? It often does, and there are all sorts of experimental models out there. We ourselves make more money selling stock footage since we put the same footage online for free downloading.

Ubiquity raises value. Culture is an infinitely renewable resource. Does the value of ""Stairway to Heaven"" suffer because somewhere in America, someone's playing it on the radio every thirty seconds?

Perhaps we'll never know whether models of plenty beat out models of scarcity, but we may learn something as we experiment along the way and give actors a fairer shake.

8 The pleasure of recognition warms us on cold nights and cools us in hot summers 

We add meaning to culture by remixing it. Putting something in a new context helps you see it with new eyes; it's like bringing your partner home to the parents for the first time, or letting a dog loose to run in the waves. 

We also infuse culture with new pleasure. When the maker who calls him or herself Otto Nomous made the short video The Fellowship of the Ring of Free Trade, he or she sought to decode the hidden prophecies contained in The Lord of the Rings and prove that it was an anarchist parable relevant to the present day. This video reveals the decoded dialogues through witty subtitles set in an Elvish typestyle. It is delightful and you can easily find it online.

Remixing is estrangement in the way the classic writers like Viktor Shklovsky and Bertolt Brecht described it. And yet the raw material remains familiar and recognizable. It's at once a subversive and reassuring process. Some writers, like John Updike and not like Jonathan Lethem, fear the emerging mashed-up book. They hope their texts won't be scrambled or altered, that they'll always retain the same identity and continuity, and follow the same course. But rivers, like information, route themselves around obstacles, and the bends in rivers are where adventures happen. We'll find new ways to experience and value old works as a consequence of mixing them into newer ones.

9 We approach the future by typically roundabout means 

It's said that storytelling is hardwired into our brains — that we respond most deeply and emotionally to storylines, characters and narrative arcs. You hear this from everyone, from folklorists to cable TV programming executives. You can't drive a project through the distribution system if it lacks certain compulsory elements. You can, of course, employ traditional elements in novel and dramatic ways: this may get you awards.

Though I agree that stories wield power, I think this power is arbitrary. We believe in storytelling because we've naturalized the consensus that causes us to believe in it. There is no reason for this consensus not to change as the world changes. Storytelling as we know it is not an absolute, and it may slow the courses of culture and history. We value storytelling for its ability to wrap new skins on old skeletons, but even bones don't last forever.

10 We hope the future is listening, and the past hopes we are too 

It may be vain to hope that our works survive into the future and will be seen and listened to, but still we hope so. If we want to encourage those not yet born to think historically, we need to begin by thinking historically ourselves. This inevitably pushes us into the territory of preexisting materials. 

11 What's gone is irretrievable, but might also predict the future

For 20 years I collected old educational and industrial films. They were made to instruct and socialize young people with the objective of turning them into dependable workers, good citizens and avid consumers. 1980s audiences became fascinated with these films and a cult following developed.

I was psyched to see this happen, but became disenchanted with what to me seemed like superficial and ahistorical reactions to the films. For many people, they triggered regressive nostalgic reactions. Others treated them as surreal documents, as bizarre oddities, as the stuff of long-gone conspiracies to manufacture consensus. All of these were true in a way, but something seemed to be missing.

The breakthrough for me was to realize that these films didn't just describe a lost past, but might also be tracing the contours of possible futures. In other words, we could see them not simply as antiquated, but as predictive. And this has in fact come true. Many of today's suburban children live the walled-in lives of their 1950s counterparts. Corporate and government interests are conflated. We fear those we call terrorists as we once feared those we called communists.

We can't go back to the world of the past, but sometimes the past overtakes us.

12 Access to what's already happened is cheaper than access to what's happening now 

Sidewalk sales, dumpsters, library discard carts, Craigslist, your grandmother's attic all contain masses of content just waiting to be cut up and reassembled. Every city has an outsider archivist who's rescued some important collection of something from landfill and may be looking for collaborators. The past lies ready to be remade.

Yes, you can remix the present and upload it to YouTube, but they can take it down and they will, if you use content that someone else owns. The emerging digital media use electronic locks to inhibit reuse, and what you download on Saturday may vanish from your hard disk on Monday. We are beginning to turn fair use into a legal right rather than a legal defense, but we haven’t yet won. 

Don't shrink from remixing the present, but enjoy the freedom that comes with working with public domain material. The public domain is the coolest neighborhood on the frontier.

13 Archives are justified by use 

This might seem obvious to you and me, but it doesn't really work that way in the archival world. Until recently (and I generalize), archives focused more on preserving records than on providing access to them. Though this has begun to change, archives have had a really difficult time reengineering themselves and their culture to meet the vastly increased demand for their holdings. 

Which brings us again to YouTube. In addition to generating lawsuits and refocusing mass culture onto a shrunken, fuzzy screen, it's raised critical issues for archives. Media archives have tried to join the 21st century by putting little bits and pieces online. They face such opposition internally and from copyright holders that they’ve had to take baby steps. Now YouTube has raised public expectations, and it’s hard to see how any institution can meet them. In its first 12 months, YouTube built an easy-to-access online collection of some 7 million digital videos that I'd argue has become the world's default media archives. Everything anyone does to bring archives online is now going to be measured against YouTube's ambiguous legacy. It presents a massive collection of older and newer material, from video of Malcolm X's complete speeches to clips of the moose I saw wandering in front yards in Anchorage. It sticks to preview mode, presenting visually degraded Flash video, so it will still get sued, but most rightsholders will rightfully regard what it does as promotion. Best of all, it allows users to upload almost anything and annotate with relative freedom. It is not an archives, but it's outclassed archives at their own game.

In order for archives to survive while the YouTubes rule, they need to be used. And it is up to us to use the amazing things that they hold.

14 Make a quilt not an advertisement

Quilting is an early form of sampling. A patchwork quilt combines preexisting fabric from many sources. Quilting relies on what geeks call interoperability — the ability of elements to fit into a matrix and function together. That's what makes the Internet work — machines and networks can talk with one another and freely exchange bits.

Interoperability requires openness. But today openness is threatened in many ways. While some companies have built business models around openness, many others haven't. Right now, for instance, private companies are scanning books in publicly-owned and tax-exempt libraries around the world. Because the companies are paying for digitization, they control access to these new digital books, even though the books themselves may be in the public domain. Many online books let you see images of the pages, but don't permit access to the raw text. You cannot cut and paste the text or grab it so you can index it yourself. That isn't open, and these books don't interoperate. You can't weave a textual quilt using books from Project Gutenberg and books from Google. If we're to build networked books, to freely cite the work of others and merge past and present, we need to make sure that openness is at the core of all of our activities. Cultural material needs to be shared and distributed as freely as the law allows.

But above all quilting is folk art, not corporate expression. It's about turning leftovers into something that's both transcendent and useful. It doesn't have selling at its core.

Sarah Kember

As I start to write this brief contribution to the launch of Ada – an exciting initiative not only in feminist publishing but also in the wider questions it raises about the relation between politics and technology now – it is not clear to me whether, or to what extent, “we” need another feminist manifesto, let alone a futurist one![i] Futurism is inherently problematic, not so much in its tendency to make predictions that may or may not (usually not) prove accurate, but in its adherence to technology-driven visions that play out a limited dualism of utopias and dystopias, of secularized heavens and hells. Notwithstanding the rich and often wonderful visual, popular and literary culture these visions have produced, have we not learned enough about the complex relation between technology, politics and the social to be done with the future today?

Maybe not. I’m reminded of David Lyon’s intervention in the Information Society debate (1995). Neither a celebrant nor a skeptic, Lyon simply refuses to separate technology from ‘some view of the good society’ (7). For him, futurism is legitimate if it is neither ignorant of technology nor driven by it. When it comes to technology, we are still learning to think outside of the terms of all or nothing and to regard it, in short, less as an independent agent – that will either supersede us (in intelligence, in the evolutionary stakes) or act as a panacea on our behalf – and more as a co-constituent of what we call human –  a form of agency that we work and are simultaneously worked with (Haraway 1991; Hayles 1999; Stiegler 1998; McLuhan 2006). If technology is not our friend, it does not need to become our enemy. It is important to recall the master/slave history of human-machine relations at a time when we’re being told that our smart devices and environments are designed solely to meet our individual needs, wants and whims (Suchman 2007). That is because these technologies are serving us in a double sense. They are serving us – up. They are converting their servility into a praxis of TTL (Targeting, Tracking and Location), integrating systems of marketing and surveillance and, by degrees, turning human subjects into data objects destined for advertisers and app developers. Industry-led visions of the technological future have always been disingenuous, but never more than now. There is therefore the distinct possibility that we’ve never been more in need of alternatives. A feminist futurist manifesto – especially one with an eye on the past – might offer one such alternative.

History is often deployed against the errant, beguiled, forward-looking lover of media and technology. I use the military metaphor advisedly. This is a long, drawn out and frankly tedious war between the technophobes and technophiles and their alignment, respectively, with what is properly academic and scholarly and what, on the other hand, is at best the sort of intellectualizing that serves as an indirect apology for capital and progress. Marshall McLuhan’s trajectory has been described and dismissed in this way. Yet his work says so much about the technological environment we inhabit and comprise — so troubles the paranoid dialectic of use = use or be used — that it is being reprieved, refashioned. I am one of a number of theorists who wants to think with McLuhan again, with provisos, but without (academic) prejudice (Bolter and Grusin 2000; Lister et. al. 2009). I’m certainly troubled by aspects of his work, not least its gender blindness. Still, I find its imaginative reach more fruitful than the grounded, but ultimately flattening approaches that oppose it and that use history as a/their weapon. Is the internet really no more than ‘an instantaneous telegraph with a prodigious memory’ (Marvin 1988: 3)? The very premise is absurd. It proposes that history is linear and simply tracks back what the opposition has projected forward, creating, precisely, nothing but a counter-progressive, anti-teleological argument. Following Bolter and Grusin (following Foucault, following Nietzsche) I think of history as genealogy, not teleology – it simply does not move in straight lines.[ii] In this scenario, we’re faced with the remediation of the telegraph through the internet and that process is at once iterative and transformative.

Feminists have co-opted Foucault’s genealogies of hospitals, prisons, schools, workhouses, asylums and so on to tell hidden histories of our own.[iii] Our genealogies of feminism itself are also important precisely because they are not an investment in linearity – in going backwards to go forwards – but rather in ways of recognizing the complex, contested process of iteration and transformation. I appreciate Vikki Bell’s yoking of feminist histories and futures and most of all her observation that ‘the alternative vision of feminism is a display of an imaginative faculty’ (1999: 5). I am drawn to Clare Hemming’s account of what is at stake in feminist stories about feminism, and to her courage in suggesting that we might want to tell these differently – without recourse to narratives of progress, loss and return – if we are to sustain the ‘radical potential of feminist theory’ (2011: 2). Feminist genealogies, in addition to genealogies of feminism, rather than deploying history against the future, engage it through an investment that is necessarily imaginative, even speculative, in the possibility of political change. The premise, as Hemmings urges us to both see and tell, is that (our) politics are far from lost.

I want to highlight two aspects of a feminist genealogical approach to a technological future that isn’t (and never was) all about technology. The first consists of taking stock, of re-reading and of bringing forward, particularly those silenced, forgotten or marginalized areas of feminist debate so that we may avoid the tendency to repeat ourselves or indeed to make ‘turns’ that are predominantly or in part returns to concepts, categories and methodologies we have known.[iv] What, I wonder, would the now effectively silenced discourse of feminist psychoanalysis contribute to the current physics-inspired emphasis on agential relationality?[v] Is the need to extend our range of analysis from people to particles enough to justify the elision of an entire dimension of desire and other-than conscious drives? Do we presume that the subjects of contemporary technological culture lack an unconscious (that desire is a two-dimensional, mind-body affirmation of our becoming) or are we merely happy to leave that realm, that third dimension (or is it fourth?) to the writers and artists of science fiction who, presumably, have nothing to do with us? Do we no longer trade in desire when we write our feminist theories? My own re-reading of the once ‘new’ French feminists (who lie behind Haraway as solidly as Whitehead does), of Cixous in particular, was nothing short of stirring from the outset: ‘I shall speak about women’s writing: about what it will do’ (1985: 245). Did we stop speaking about this because of an essentialism that was never, at least unproblematically there, that was never not framed or contested from within, from the recognition by Cixous herself that there is ‘no general’, ‘no one typical’ woman? What Cixous highlights is richness, diversity, non-homogeneity. ‘Women’s imaginary’, she says, ‘is inexhaustible, like music, painting, writing…’[vi]

Cixous’ injunction to write – ‘write, let no one hold you back’ – is, broadly speaking, the other aspect of a feminist genealogy that I seek to highlight here, in my proto-manifesto that is necessarily a manifesto of the ‘manifestoes’ that came before it, that also marked the launch of new journals and that sought, as I do too, to trouble the waters of feminist successes and failures and to persist in the project of transforming knowledge and/as life via the exposure of a certain masculinism that – surely – continues to reside there: ‘The frightful masculine fashion of speaking always surprises me. Speaking in order to be right – how ridiculous!’ (Gauthier 1985: 200).[vii]

Xaviére Gauthier lambasts an imitable and imitated (by “us”?) tendency to speak in order to be right or ‘in fact, to put someone else in the wrong’ (200). This is speech without reference to the vocal or the spoken, deaf to ‘the mutilation of meaning’ that must otherwise occur. It persists, she says, even ‘while a new voice is beginning to be heard’ through the gaps, speaking ‘on behalf of the unsaid’. This, perhaps never really new spoken – and written – voice continues to come through the gaps in ‘a socio-symbolic order’ that is not only, but still significantly masculine not least in its persistent claim to be right. If we call this claim representationalism,[viii] and the counter-claim is performativity[ix] then the question for me – following the logic of thesis, antithesis and synthesis – concerns the kind of critical languages (Franklin 2007), the modes of communication and critique (formed by and forming of a voice that speaks and writes on behalf of the unsaid) that are made possible or even necessary by the particular problems and challenges we now face.

 

The second part of my virtual[x] manifesto addresses this question of problems and, if not solutions then strategies to tackle them. The key to the latter will include, especially, a re-appraisal of ‘our’ — meaning not exclusively women’s, but post-cyborg, feminist — writing. Broadly, and from the standpoint of my own research in media, science and technology, those problems are threefold.

We are faced with exacerbated asymmetries in gendered forms of power and knowledge including or especially where those asymmetries appear to be addressed. This of course is characteristic of a neoliberal rationality[xi] which is embedded and naturalized in contemporary embedded and naturalized forms of so-called ubiquitous computing and in the partially present futurisms of supposedly human-centric, relational, affective, intelligent and intimate environments of the home and/or city. The re-orderings (of human subjects as data objects for integrated systems of surveillance and marketing) that structure these environments are rendered opaque by industry-driven investment in, even colonization of the quotidian, the ordinary everyday life of the individualized user/consumer. It is of note that the machinations of Facebook and Google are assimilated within specific, branded developments of ubiquitous computing known as Ambient Intelligence and Ambient Media. These emergent technosciences seek to reinforce a notion of everyday life even as they change it almost beyond recognition. We need to expose this sleight of hand – this Trojan Horse – especially in the light of reifications of everyday life in aspects of cultural studies (Hall 2008); notions of use and user-driven social media (Lovink 2011) and a tendency in current forms of theorizing to regard processes of affect and relationality as solutions to asymmetries of power rather than as questions we have begun to pose to them (Suchman 2007). Re-orderings at the level of subject and object privilege feminist ethical, political, epistemological and ontological interventions.

Another key problem concerns the extension of reductionism or the alignment of women with particular forms of re/productivity including, now, precarious labour plus a move away from the reduction of bodies to code (courtesy of internal as well as external critiques of genetic determinism) towards a more diffuse alignment between computationalism and (everyday) life itself. I’m thinking here not just of the segue from Artificial Life to Synthetic Biology but of Artificial Intelligence to Ambient Intelligence. The apparent downsizing of contemporary science and technology from claims to artifice (machines that can think and live) to those of ambience and augmentation are deeply disingenuous and, in as far as they extend the reach of biopower through i.e. gendered visions of the smart home,[xii]servile agents and avatars embodying female stereotypes etc, they require a gendered form of biopolitics.[xiii] Even within the short life span of Ambient Intelligence, the iconic agent of servility has shifted from that of the butler to that of the nurse. Ambient intelligent nurses, designed to manage and regulate an ageing population @home rather than in the care of the state, would know when they were needed, come when they were called and cost next to nothing compared with the flesh and blood variety who are already ever more precariously employed.

I would also want to highlight the ongoing mechanization and commercialization of the entire life process through developments in genetic engineering, Synthetic Biology and their alignment with apparently less hubristic projects like Ambient Intelligence and Augmented Reality that are actually anything but. If we were to look back at our concerns in the 80s and 90s with a rationality of total control particularly in the context of imaging and reproductive technologies (Stabile 1992; Treichler 1990) we might ask what happens to that argument about control and totality now that it is, perhaps, more visibly about what markets do than science and technology per se.[xiv] What and where are the limits to control when there is no recourse to nature/body/life outside of their instrumentalisation?

Feminist methodologies are forms of intervention, of making a difference and my own trace a course (not necessarily a progressive one) from dissent to dialogue back to what Derrida calls dissension – the internal revolutions or overturnings that might afford us non-entrepreneurial opportunities or spaces for some serious play. Dissensions occur through the non-homogeneity of all fields of praxis, including our own. They occur through technological limitations, hubristic absurdities and for me, especially through the entanglements of science and storytelling. My recent re-reading of the cyborg manifesto, rightly distanced by Haraway due to its cold war connotations, reinforced my determination to pursue and advocate storytelling as theory for post-cyborgs and writing as a pre-eminent technology of intervention (1991). Bearing in mind that anthropologists as well as novelists, feminists as well as scientists are storytellers and that writing long exceeded the word to include cells, sounds and media-making – I don’t think we have reached the full potential or implications of this approach. If the potential is there for us to do knowledge differently, for example through cell-making that is not for profit and through generating forms of media that are always already critiques of media (Juhasz 2011) then the implications are that we can no longer retreat into our own forms of story-free scientism, disown our own failed writing experiments or talk of the limitations of off-the peg categories and concepts – subject/object, nature/culture, human/machine – in theory as if theory weren’t already a form of practice, experimentation, speculation.

Of course, not all forms of storytelling are treated equally so we need, I think, a re-appraisal of writing strategies such as parody alongside our pursuit of innovations in publishing, trans/mediality and disciplinarity and a shift, perhaps in how we see ourselves in relation to the academy, industry and publics.[xv] [15] In one possible vision of a feminist future steeped in post-cyborgian storytelling, we take more responsibility for our becomings within, and without the academy.

 

[i] In fact, it was clear to me at a discussion about Fembot and Ada that took place at ICA, Phoenix in May 2012 that this initiative raises some of the key questions that currently cut across industry and academia, namely those concerning the future of (academic) publishing, the gendered re-organisation of labour, emergent and open business models in the creative economy and issues of copyright and IP.

[ii] Vikki Bell, writing in the context of feminist genealogy, presents genealogy as ‘an attempt to historicize values’ (1999: 2). For Bolter and Grusin (2000), Foucault’s genealogies are also hidden histories that are refashioned and re-circulated in the present, thus constituting an alternative to linear, progressive histories oriented to a an ultimate goal or endpoint.

[iii] See notably Elaine Showalter’s The Female Malady (1995).

[iv] Affective, material, performative and so on.

[v] Jan Campbell (2006) has written on psychoanalysis and notions of time but I’m thinking also of un-revisited work such as that of Jessica Benjamin on intersubjectivity (1988).

[vi] ‘What they have in common I will say. But what strikes me is the infinite richness of their individual constitutions: you can’t talk about a female sexuality, uniform, homogeneous, classifiable into codes – any more than you can talk about one unconscious resembling another. Women’s imaginary is inexhaustible, like music, painting, writing…’ (245).

[vii] ‘Write, let no one hold you back, let nothing stop you: not man; not the imbecilic capitalist machinery, in which publishing houses are the crafty, obsequious relayers of imperatives handed down by an economy that works against us and off our backs…’ (247).

[viii] Representationalism, for Barad ‘is the belief in the ontological distinction between representations and that which they purport to represent’ (2007: 46). Where these refer to forms of knowledge – including science – as well as images, it is notable that where Haraway genders them, Barad does not.

[ix] Performative understanding constitutes an alternative to representationalism: ‘Performative approaches call into question representationalism’s claim that there are representations, on the one hand, and ontologically separate entities awaiting representation, on the other…’ (2007: 49). Barad’s turn to performativity is arguably something of a return.

[x] Virtual meaning real but not actual – a philosophical distinction concerned with the efficacy of potentiality. Also a play on online/almost…

[xi]One that absorbs and deepens differences assimilating values unto itself (Brown 2005).

[xii] See Microsoft’s Janet and her amazing talking kitchen worktop: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODpReoKQVXM.

[xiii] If biopower signals Foucault’s concern with the operation of regulatory power at the level of the individual and social body, biopolitics signals the particular regimes, tools and techniques by means of which biopower operates.

[xiv] Industry and government driven visions of control have always exceeded the ability of technologies to actually deliver them.

[xv] Imagine the potential of combining the still masculine Oulipian project, based on plagiarism, parody and the emergence of potential literature (Motte 2007) with the desire to parody, to remake as ridiculous, the voice that speaks in order to be right!

Introduction 2
The sky was the color of a screen, churning code into a maelstrom.

It blew through the Wheel of Sheffield, and we blinked amid the post-utopian flicker of hypertext theory and the fast shadows of the Late Age of Print.

A viral meme circulated above us, growing, morphing, forming a cloud of tags: digital media - literary practice - literary study - reading - art - materiality. Below us were roots turning fields of promiscuous linkages into systems.

Revolutions take time, some (read: Gutenberg) much more than others (read: Gates), and that wheel (read: Ferris) in its languid rotations was a figure for our desire to do something that might be odd, out of character, or almost anachronistic in the midst of the raging torrent of the digital age: we paused. And at rest, we reflected, not so much on what digital media will mean for literary practice and literary studies, and reading itself, but what it has already meant.

We sought to sow rhizomes, till topologies, define a field of scholarship that would conduct systematic, fine-grained analyses of literary fiction in a snarl of networked and programmable media.

What better place for our ideas about ‘literary machines’ to take shape and solidify? What better place to forge a conception of a new literary art emerging from a new materiality? We were there in the crucible city, a city that wears its material history on its coal-stained sleeve, that fired in its own belly the iconic objects of the industrial age.

A manifesto is political; a mission statement is corporate. We deleted these concepts from our discussion. We were not etching a scroll of aesthetic edicts for the digital ages. We were not carving a credo in the sense of monologic truth or certainty, of liberation, of democratization, of salvation, of renewal.

What emerged was a platform of critical principles to guide us in our exploration of digital-literary art, a foundation for any claim to the cultural and literary significance of fiction written on and for a computer screen. What emerged moves through motherboards, cycles through silicone circuits across endless screens and keyboards, roiling through artists’ code, readers’ clicks, and scholars’ listserves… returning, as it does, from the most disembodied forms of electronic machinery to the embodied structures of critical consciousness, or imagination (before setting out again).

What emerged was a creed for the screen. In a word, a [s]creed.

A [s]creed for digital fiction embraces…
close analysis. We take a bottom-up approach. We base our conclusions on examples. We substantiate every critical assertion with a case. Theory is vital to us but analyses provide the evidence on which we base our conjectures. In scholarship, it is not sufficient to talk only of the pleasurable or intimidating experiences of reading digital fiction. Anecdotal tales of our frustrations or delights, even when they are compelling, do not yield interpretations. When we lose our thread or become deeply engrossed, we isolate and interrogate the mechanisms that are responsible (Rustad 2009). We are heavily invested in the questions that empirical and analytical readings yield (Ensslin and Bell 2007) with an awareness of close reading as a historical medium specific practice.

code. As critics primarily and coders peripherally, we recognize the importance of code in digital fiction, and we do so on a continuum. On the one end, the incorporation and recombination of elements of programming language, binary code, and mark-up conventions implicitly affects the semantic space of the text. On the other end, the same codestuff can be used explicitly, infecting and inflecting the text to defamiliarize the work of art.

cybersomatics and corporeality. We believe that the reading of digital fiction involves a different kind of connection with the text because we sit in front of a computer, bodily integrated with the machine, and at the same time ontologically separated from the world that it describes. We are dually embodied - embodied proper, as ‘actual’ users of hardware and software, and re-embodied through our (fictional) representations as implied readers in the virtual domain. In experiencing digital fiction, we become part of a cybernetic feedback loop, in which we feed and are fed back perpetually. We are immersed in a continual stimulus-response circuit, a self-regulatory mechanism, to speak with Norbert Wiener and against René Descartes. The text is us. The machine is us. They are us-ing us as we are us-ing them - in an abstract amalgamation of genetic, linguistic and algorithmic coding (Ensslin 2009, 2010a/b).

digital fiction, of course, which, in our DeFINition, is fiction written for and read on a computer screen that pursues its verbal, discursive and/or conceptual complexity through the digital medium, and would lose something of its aesthetic and semiotic function if it were removed from that medium.

gender & digital writing technologies. We embrace cyberfeminism, technofeminism, postfeminism, or any feminism that makes a meaningful engagement with digital media and digital fiction as a mode of expression. But as true ‘Patchwork Girls’ we are wary of notions that the same digital writing technologies, namely hypertext, are somehow inherently “feminine” in form, or embody some essential aspect of women’s writing; that is, we steer away from any understanding that simply reverses patriarchal modes of technological determinism on feminist terms.

generations. Authors will inevitably exploit the latest technologies and, as techno-junkies, we eagerly await the fruits of that labor. But, a Storyspace hypertext is potentially just as interesting to us as a Flash or HyperCard fiction. Each facilitates narrative and semiotic experimentation and for that reason we analyze generations of digital fiction inclusively. Whether there are three: hypertext, hypermedia, cybertext (Ensslin 2007). Or two: pre-Web & post-Web. Or one. Or more. Or none at all. It is the aesthetic force, reflexive engagement and complexity of a fiction, rather than its place in a process of technological advancement, that captures our imagination and determines our raison d’être. To this end, we embrace media archaeology as a critical methodology important to the study of digital fiction and to fictions about digitality.

immersion & interaction (or participation or input), or more specifically the tension that arises between the two poles. We don’t think that a multilinear digital narrative that constantly requires your attendance at a screen as well as your input through some sort of device can be immersive in the same way that a print narrative (Bell 2010a, 2010b). But we do think it can be immersive in a different way (Ciccoricco 2007, Rustad 2009, Ensslin 2009, 2010a/b). After all, digital fiction isn’t just ‘read’, or ‘watched’, or ‘played’ - it is ‘experienced’, and these experiences have to be seen as all-encompassing phenomenological processes.

internationality. We are an international group invested in analyzing digital fiction across languages and cultures.

lines. Some of the earliest hypertextualists did not care much for the notion of “nonlinearity,” and rightly asked: why define digital textuality in terms of negation and lack when in fact digital fictions embrace a multiplicty of lines rather than a lack of any one true line? We see multilinearity as a defining element of digital fiction and we see it manifesting itself in ways that are distinctive to its medium. At the same time, we keep in mind that reading itself is a temporal act that is characterized by its irrefutable linearity, which is undertaken by an irrefutably embodied reader.

medial affordances. We pay as much attention to the means of dissemination - screen, speaker, software - as we do to the fictions they collectively transmit. We preach that a VDU is not a codex and that a node is not a page. We recognize that HTML, Storyspace and Flash each offer different tools and permit different kinds of modal, structural, and aesthetic experimentation. Media-specifics are acknowledged in our theory and our analyses.

modal affordance. We pay as much attention to the means of representation - text, image, sound - as we do to the fictions they collectively construct. We identify the possibilities and constraints under which digital fictions are produced and received. A semiotic approach to digital fiction allows us, as analysts, to reflect on the ways in which different modal affordances are or can be utilized in a work.

multimedial and multimodal interplay. Multimedia and multimodal works are inevitably always more than just a simple remediation of analogue media or a sum of their constituent elements. Call it convergence, call it divergence: we close-read the interaction between media and modes.

narratological approaches. From the classical distinction between plot and story to the post-classical analysis of actual versus fictional worlds, we use rigorous methods and well established terminology. Narrative theory allows interpretations of (digital) narrative fiction to be based on sound structural foundations but we explore the extent to which print-oriented narratological approaches apply to non-print texts. We investigate and suggest theoretical tenets arising from their distinct (inter-)medial and ludic qualities.

networks. Nodal, modal, medial, and human. Our working methods replicate many of the texts we study. We mix approaches in order to generate holistic conclusions. We are committed to the efficacy of collaborative working. As the open so[u]rcerer, Linus, famously says: given enough eyeballs, all misinterpretations are shallow.

nodes and nodal coherence. As the building blocks of any networked text and many-a-digital fiction, we treat nodes as semantic units that are meaningful both independent of and in relation to the larger network in which they reside. The idea of a node is exciting to us in terms of digital textuality: it is a new bibliographical unit peculiar to digital environments (i.e. chapter, footnote, stanza, node).

reflexivity. We believe that self-consciousness in fiction takes on broader associations when the written word must locate itself among several modes. Given that any fiction can refer not just to its fictionality but also to its materiality, digital fictions deliver a new form of reflexivity. In addition to discursive playfulness which is found within the text, the screen on which it is read, the mouse with which it is clicked, and the code in which it is written can all be used to alert the reader to the ontological status of the work and the world that it describes.

readers. We assert that different readers and different kinds of readers interact with digital fictions in diverse ways (Rustad 2009).

reading. Is there really even any place for a contemplative literary art in digital environments inundated with the audio-visual, the animated, and the immediate? We think so. And we think that the analyses of digital fiction that are now emerging attests to the fact that literary complexity can - and has - migrated to digital environments. And yet, we are aware that reading practices and, indeed, our notion of literacy is changing and try to be attentive to these changes in focus and practice.

re-reading. The analysis of any literary text involves re-reading. Digital fictions, and network fictions in particular, take the practice of re-reading to another level because the recycling of nodes, is fundamental to (hyper)textual comprehension (Ciccoricco 2007). Digital fictions encourage and cultivate an ‘aesthetics of revis(itat)ion’ (Ensslin 2007) - as every re-reading results in a revision of the previously constructed mental image of the text.

semiotics. As analysts of multimodal works, we must isolate, interrogate and interpret signs from a variety of semiotic systems and their meaningful interplay.

stylistics. Analyzing the way in which a digital fiction is written reveals how meaning is constructed linguistically. Whether it be word, phrase, clause, or sentence, we scrutinize signifier and signified, forms and functions, denotative and connotative meanings. While we “read” audiovisual and verbal modes, we are inspired and guided by the written word and the symbolic meanings it activates.

systematic methodologies. We are unabashed about our structuralist predilections and flaunt our formalist leanings. We make observations that are transparent and utilize replicable techniques. We analyze according to an explicit method whether that be based on narrative theory (Bell 2007, 2010a, 2010b; Ensslin 2010a/b, forthcoming; Ciccoricco 2007; Laccetti 2009), stylistics (Bell 2007, Ensslin 2007), New Criticism (Pressman 2008), semiotics (Ensslin 2009, Rustad 2010), aesthetic reception theory (Rustad 2009) or any other systematic analytic approach.

theoretical waves. We perceive that the study of digital fiction has undergone a significant paradigm shift from a first-wave of theoretical debate to a second-wave of methodological analysis (Bell 2010a, 2010b; Ciccoricco 2007; Ensslin 2007; Ensslin and Bell 2007). While first-wave theory sought to understand digital fiction predominantly in terms of abstract poststructuralist models, we see the second-wave as offering an explicit application of theorized practices. We collaborate in order to harmonize second-wave theory by establishing clarifications, modifications, and supplementations to current methods. While we embrace and endorse second-wave approaches, we are indebted to and build upon first-wave foundations.

topologies. It’s no longer location location location they say, but connection connection connection. To speak topologically is to speak the language of links and nodes and, more broadly, the language of narrative fiction in digital environments. As scholars of digital textuality, we are prepared to move away from the dominant literary-critical paradigm of a textual topography and speak more accurately of textual topology (Ciccoricco 2007).

[The] Web. It is one of our primary means of consumption and dissemination. It houses creative works that interest us and stages critical debates in which we engage. This is not say that we favor web fictions over digital fictions stored on data carriers. Needless to add, those are commonly traded online as well…

A [s]creed for digital fiction deliberately neglects…
…blogs,

…communitarian digital fiction,

…digital storytelling,

… and any other form of digital narrative that does not qualify as fiction. While we welcome the authorial democratization that Web 2.0 technology permits and wholeheartedly support research that seeks to understand it, life narratives are fundamentally nonfiction and therefore beyond our remit.

…e-books. While Project Gutenberg and Google books, e-readers and Kindle all fantastically facilitate reading great works of print online (be it Shakespeare, Austen or Nabokov), the meaning of these paper-under-glass texts is not intrinsically linked to, enhanced by, or affected by the digital. They do not qualify as digital fiction, at least not according to our DeFINition.

…games we can’t ‘read’, or rather games where there is no dynamic relationship between the gameplay (rules) and its themes (representations) that we can read into, reflect on, or interpret.

But enough of what we don’t do and a return to what we do…

Above all, we believe that digital media do not dispossess us of the interpretive reading practices that we have developed relative to print, but we are certain that they do imply a new mode of literary study and analysis. Reading texts in digital environments still involves critical practices that have been developed in print scholarship: it still involves analyzing linguistic, structural, semiotic, intertextual and semantic elements. However, it also involves digital literacy.

Let us elucidate further…

In print environments, you can analyze a sound or syllable, a word, a line, a stanza or an entire poem. You can analyze a paragraph or an entire novel. In digital environments, you can do the same. But you can also analyze a node or a path of nodes and this will inevitably include a reading of the links that both separate and connect them, so that the object of reading is a navigational structure and its enactment. You can analyze processes, movements, interactions and the dictates of the underlying code. You can analyze images (either static or dynamic) and sound (be it music, voice or noise). You can analyze hardware and software, as well as the machine-human interface, and their receptive and aesthetic effects.

Exploiting the latest body of research, the DFIN will produce a body of exemplary analyses of digital fiction substantiated by robust theoretical and terminological conclusions. We will develop a range of tools and associated terminology for digital fiction analysis and provide a body of criticism based on the close reading of a range of digital fiction texts. Implicit in such an agenda is a revisioning of what “close reading” means for a work of fiction that is written for and read on a computer screen, that pursues its verbal, discursive and/or conceptual complexity through the digital medium, and that would lose something of its aesthetic function if it were removed from that medium. In the spirit of techno-literary revolutions, it is to this enterprise that we now turn…

Humans are unique on this planet in their zest for transformation. Most animals are content to live out their lives as they happen, letting their instincts guide them through whatever fate deals them. Humans, however, have always been into transforming themselves and/or their environment. Most animals change slowly over centuries - a process of gradual evolution. Humankind is more impatient - constantly upheaving things in a state of revolution.

Since prehistoric times people have decorated their bodies, adorning themselves with clothes, paints and jewellery which go beyond the practical into the ornamental.

Then there are transformations of the self which are more permanent - such physical changes as scarification, tattooing and body alterations (such as the lip-stretching plates of the Amazons and the neck-stretching bands of some African tribes).

Irrefutable changes such as these are likely to affect the consciousness of those who undergo them. The physical realm affects and reflects the mental and spiritual realms. Often we will undergo an outer transformation to signify externally, changes within; the reverse also occurs - if we change our bodies dramatically, our minds and souls are likely to follow suit, adapting to the new forms they are encompassed in.

In modern western society there is a huge drive towards mass conformity. Obnoxious mass media advertising and the availability of mass-produced goods (clothes, etc) has many indoctrinated into all looking alike and living standard sub/urban lifestyles.

In reaction many of those who differ from the norm do so to the extreme. Those who do not wish to be identified with the conforming masses make an effort to individualise their appearance as much as possible.

Over the decades there have been many different subcultural styles. Now these are all being mixed and merged and mismatched into new mutated forms. The modern mutant draws from many eras, places, cultures and subcultures, bending and blending them together, distorting and contorting them into the future.

Mutation is not of course a solely external process. Many people are constantly transforming themselves through yoga, meditation, music, drugs and magic. These things are, like the different styles of adornment which may outwardly symbolise them, in a constant state of flux, drawing from the vast array of sources available this century and mutating them into new forms.

And of course not all those who metamorphosise powerfully on an inner level want to show it on the outside, for various social or personal reasons; even as some freaky looking people somehow manage to remain unexceptional on other levels.


Tattooing is an ages-old artform that is finally being recognised as such. Some modern tattooists are at last breaking away from the confines of 'pop' art, cartoon imagery and realism, now incorporating tribal designs from many cultures. Some tattooists are beginning to take body form into account - instead of just 'stamping' flat pictures onto the skin, images are being twisted and twined around the form of the body. This added dimension and the new range of colours and tones available are beginning to take tattooing beyond mere surface drawing and into the realms of painting and even sculpture.

If muscle-flexing and other movements are considered, tattoos can come to life; drawings of figures can become animated puppets, images of faces and forms can ripple and change.

Things can be sewn into the skin for added texture, etc. Many parts of the body can be stretched and reshaped over time.

We are not so bound to the forms we were born with as it may at first seem - our bodies are toys to be played with 
(see The Mutation En-cyclops-edia). Likewise our minds and spirits can experience revolution through magic and medicine. We can open doorways to other realms of possibility. Even science is beginning to admit that 'consensus reality's not the only reality.

What scares many about tattoos and other body alterations is that they are irrevocable. This is true, and for this reason the effects, inner and outer, of such changes should be considered carefully before one begins; but the fact that most people tend to neglect is that there is always the possibility of further change. If you don't like something you've changed on/in yourself, keep changing until you do. There is no going back, granted, but you can always go further forward. The possibilities are endless. Don't be afraid to change. Stagnation is our enemy.


MUTATION MANIFESTO PART II : 

MUTATION & TECHNOLOGY -THE POST-HUMAN


In the last few years since I first wrote Part I of the Mutation Manifesto, the potential for mutation of the human species has increased rapidly. Modern technologies, in additon to giving us access to information world wide, have been applied practically to the human body. Advances in computers, prosthetics and robotics have begun to blur the boundaries between human and machine.

Body artists such as Orlan and Stelarc have experimented with using new technologies as tools for physical transformation, offering social comment on future directions via performance art. 

Orlan's operations, performed theatrically yet very real, demonstrate an extremity of physical mutation via plastic surgery Modern medicine sculpts her face progressively into a combination of different features modelled on figures from famous artworks. She has the chin of Botticelli's Venus, the mouth of Da Vinci's Mona Lisa, and so forth... As social comment on the western world's obsession with image and physical perfection, Orlan's art is obviously rather tongue-in-cheek (no not permanently -she hasn't gone that far); yet she is committed enough to it to undergo dramatic changes to her form. Perhaps ultimately her message is that physical form is becoming less relevant, that it is becoming mere putty for modern technologies to knead and model? 

Stelarc's cybernetic extra arm, operated by far-off minds via the internet, demonstrated the frightening potential of virtual/actual interactions. Earlier performances with multi-piercing suspensions began his experimentation with manipulation of the human form. New technologies offer vaster potentials for mutation, and Stelarc is facing the challenge. He claims that the human form is becoming obsolete -we are merely data in the information age. 

Theories abound as to future of the human species and our relationship with cyberspace. It is being suggested that humans will eventually be able to upload themselves into cyberspace, to become freeform in realms of information; able to be downloaded back into robots or other forms.
Despite their extremity these theories are nevertheless possibilities. However, one would hope that in our zealous hurtling into dimensions of hyperspace we do not abandon the physical. There is a beauty in nature, in the forms of plants and animals (including ourselves), which we may never hope to replace. Fantastic alternatives and enhancers may be manifested, surely, but simultaneously these should remind us of the sacredness of the flesh, and of the Earth. Let us use technology for transformation and even escapism, but not to the exclusion of our outer biosphere. Can we go far enough into inner-space to escape the throes of a dying planet-being? Or can cyber and organic fuse harmoniously, technology and biosphere nurturing each other for mutual growth? 
Perhaps Stelarc is beginning to real-ize this, if reports that he is beginning experimentation with grafting of living plant matter to the human form are true. 


Mutation of the physical form can actually be a powerful affirmation of / communication with the physical, re-establishing sensation with the body in an-increasingly virtual world. Is the escalating subculture/culture of piercing and tattooing a sensation-affirming reaction to cyberspace? Or is it an acceptance of cybernetic futures, this implanting of metal within the flesh? Or both?? 

My own mutations have been primarily organic in nature. By suturing on parts of animals, such as snakeskins to the arms and eagle-wings into the shoulderblades (see MUTATION EN-CYCLOPS-EDIA), I re-connect with my bestial nature, while also aligning myself with the spirit of the animal integrated and it's magical powers. For me, physical mutation is a glorious celebration of the malleability of the physical form. Modern technology is a wonderful way to enhance the potential of this - I would love to make some of my more extreme mutations more permanent -will the technology become available to me to permanently attach eaglewings or snakeskins to myself? (Can anyone help me with this? - email me: odxob@yahoo.com ) 

Art has been subverted in modern western culture for centuries, since 'the age of reason' began it's dominion of science and technology. But now -along with the masculine and the feminine- science and art / technology and magic are beginning to re-balance in our society. My mutations are reclamations of natural art, of aesthetics in a world dominated by sterile practicality. Let us use our technology to enhance and complement our physical environment and our physical selves, but not abandon them to it.

Introduction

Canada has been a world leader in human rights, and this is a chance for Canada to once again lead the way with a modern lawful society, where all citizens are granted the respect they deserve, and their right to privacy is protected.

As technology has changed the Copyright Act has changed, allowing consumers of creative works to use them in new ways. The way we use creative content now is not the same as it was before the photocopier or the VCR. The balance within the change in copyright has been to encourage the creation, development and dissemination of culture. As Canada looks forward we must balance society’s demand for access and dissemination with the proper encouragement to create. We argue for a society where culture and knowledge are free and accessible to all on equal terms. Today’s copyright system promotes widespread and systematic abuse that actively limits both the range and access to culture.

Copyright is also used to control government documents, slowing their dissemination and generally impeding the the efficient use of publicly funded documents. Canada should be striving towards open government, where information flows freely between government and it’s citizens. Increasing the flow of communication between the government and the citizens will increase the transparency and accountability of government in turn making the government better serve Canadians.

Our goal is to change Canadian and global legislation concerning the evolving information society, which is characterized by openness and diversity. We will reach this goal by increasing respect for our fellow citizens and their privacy, making government more accessible to it’s citizens as well as the reformation of intellectual property law. The Pirate Party of Canada’s values are based on three fundamental principles:
Personal privacy must be protected,  Culture must be set free through copyright and patent reform,  Government must be open.

Democracy, Civil Rights and Liberty

Canada’s courts have recognized the individual’s right to a reasonable expectation of privacy[1]. This fundamental right engenders several other important human rights, including:
Freedom of opinion, thought and expression,  The right to culture,  The right to personal development. All attempts by the government to restrict these rights must be questioned and opposed. All systems and methods that the state can turn against its citizens must be constantly reviewed and scrutinized by elected representatives and by citizens themselves. When the state monitors people not suspected of crimes, the individual’s privacy has been intolerably violated. Every citizen should be guaranteed the right of anonymity, and the individual’s right to protect their own personal data.

The Pirate Party opposes special treatment of terror-related crimes. The penalties and offences that already exist for acts that harm or threaten Canadian citizens or their property are adequate. The anti-terrorist laws that exist today put the legal security in jeopardy and risk being used (in extension) as a repressive measure against minorities or dissidents. The state should respect the constitution even in practice.

Respect for the citizens and their integrity means that some principles are not open for compromise, such as: ban on torture, integrity of lawmaking, due process of law, messenger immunity, and privacy of correspondence. The Pirate Party will act to expose and bring down a government that does not respect the human rights that we expect and deserve from our democracy. We also believe that such respect should be unconditional except when there is probable cause and judicial oversight.

Canadians expect their email and electronic communications to be private just as they expect their postal mail to be delivered unopened. It must therefore be prohibited to intercept or monitor phone calls, e-mail, SMS or other messages –regardless of technology or provider– in the same way that it is now forbidden to read another person’s postal mail. Employers shall only be allowed to access an employee’s messages if this is absolutely necessary to secure the technical functionality or in direct connection with the employee’s work-related duties. The government shall only be allowed access to a citizen’s means of communication or put a citizen under surveillance in the case of a firm suspicion of a crime being committed by said citizen. In all other cases, the government shall assume its citizens to be innocent and leave them alone.

Privacy of communication must be given strong protection, on many occasions, governments around the world have demonstrated themselves to be incapable of confidentially managing information at their disposal. We must resist calls to create and aggregate databases of personal information, and instead improve the protection of individual’s privacy. Such databases can be used to easily build detailed personal profiles making them high security risks. Privacy is a foundation of free speech and democracy, therefore it must be safeguarded.

Culture Must Be Set Free

Historically Canada’s Copyright Act has changed to adapt to technology, allowing consumers of creative works to use them in new ways. As technologies (photocopiers, cassette recorders and VCRs) have made it possible for citizens to affordability make copies and use content in new ways, the Copyright Act has changed to allow consumers the right to these new uses. Consistent within the changes to the Copyright Act is an exchange, the consumer gains the right to use the new technology and the creators get a new incentive to create. This is the true reason for copyright, encourage the production of creative works. As Canada looks forward we must balance society’s demand for access and dissemination with encouragement to create. We argue for a society where culture and knowledge are free and accessible to all on equal terms. Today’s copyright system promotes widespread and systematic abuse that actively limits both the range and access to culture.

The current laws now give an unfair advantage to large-market players, at the expense of consumers, creators, and society in general. Millions of works –songs, books, movies and artwork– are held hostage in media companies’ vaults, not requested enough to make re-publishing them economical, but ostensibly too lucrative to be released into the public domain. We want to make all of these works free and available to everyone, before the inks fade, pages disintegrate and film deteriorates further.

Legislation should be amended such that it only regulates the use and copying of works in the commercial context. The sharing of copies or use of another person’s work, should never be forbidden as long as it takes place on a non-commercial basis. The commercial side of the copyright law should remain, but reform is necessary. The exclusive right to produce copies of a work for commercial purposes, must be drastically reduced to a period of 5 to 15 years from the work’s initial publication. The commercial protection range shall be regulated so that anyone is free to create new works that build upon earlier creations: so-called “derivatives”. Any justified deviations from this rule, such as direct translations of books or using new music in commercial films, should be explicitly listed in the law.

Technology makes information easier and cheaper to copy, store and use in new ways. This should not be fought but embraced. Digital Rights Management (DRM) seeks to restrict the flow of information. We are against legislative measures to protect DRM technologies, the idea of consumers paying to have their rights in how they consume content reduced by technological measures is absurd. Legislative protection for DRM is bad policy that would only stifle technological growth. Any product containing DRM shall display clear warning to explicitly describe the restrictions associated with it.

Contractual agreements implemented that restrict the consumers rights to use the content they have purchased shall be declared null and void. Non-commercial distribution of published culture, information or knowledge – with the clear exception of personal data – must not be limited or punished.

Current Patents Harm Society

Private monopolies lead to excessive prices and large hidden costs. Patents are officially sanctioned monopolies on ideas. Larger companies are fighting feverishly to break records for the number of patents owned. They use these patents against smaller competitors in order to prevent them from accessing the larger market. The monopolist’s goal is to avoid fair market price and healthy competition, where as the free marketer’s focuses on price and quality for the benefit of the consumer. Patent laws are used as leverage to create unfair prices and to impose immoral restrictions. We aim to limit the abuses committed by such monopolies.

Patents have many damaging effects on society. Medical patents lead to unnecessary deaths from diseases that would have been treatable were it not for patents, distorted research priorities, and unnecessarily high medical bills. Patents on genes and life, such as patented seeds, lead to unreasonable and harmful consequences. Software patents inhibit technical progress in the IT field and pose a serious threat to small and medium sized IT companies that Canada needs for it’s technology sector.

Patents are said to encourage innovation by protecting new inventors and investors in new invention and manufacturing methods. In reality, patents are increasingly used by large corporations to hinder smaller companies from competing on equal terms. Instead of encouraging innovation, patents are being used as “mine fields” for waging war against others, often the patent owner has no plans on developing the patents themselves.

We believe that patent system is no longer serving its purpose and that today it actively hinders innovation and the creation of new knowledge. In addition, a look at all products and innovations that can not be patented shows that patents are not a requirement. The driving forces derived from being first-to-market is quite sufficient for fostering innovation. Inventors should compete fairly with natural advantages like innovative designs, customer benefits, pricing and quality, instead of with a state-awarded monopoly on knowledge. Resources liberated from paying armies of patent lawyers can be used to create real innovation and improve the products at a faster rate, which will ultimately benefit us all.

We want to reform the patent system gradually to reduce the range of patent-able inventions and to limit the length of patents. Stricter rules will also be imposed to ensure that patents are not just based on ideas but on actual inventions. Like trademarks, patents will need to be in active use or development to be enforceable. It will no longer be possible to hoard patents just to sue real innovators.

Closing Words

We want to protect the individual citizen’s fundamental human rights including privacy. When the government routinely monitors and records its citizens’ communications, this leads to the abuse of power, the lack of freedom and legal uncertainty. We demand a correction of these injustices. We demand justice, freedom and democracy for all citizens.
Today’s intellectual property rights: lead to harmful monopolies, the loss of important democratic values, hinder the creation of culture and knowledge, and hinder the free flow of information between Canadians and their government. Intellectual property rights should enrich individual peoples’ lives, enabling a healthy business climate and creating knowledge and culture, thus benefiting the development of society as a whole.

Our work is now focused on parliamentary means and therefore we seek a mandate from the people to represent them in these issues.

To unite as a strong movement, we have chosen to not take a stand in any political issues not connected with the principles declared herein. We believe members of parliament should represent their constituents while trying to form consensus and compromise in parliament, and so choose to give individual candidates the power to act on behalf of their constituents on all other political issues.

We stand united in the protection of the right to privacy, our will to reform copyrights and patents, and the need for open government.",<em>Our Manifesto</em> (Pirate Party of Canada),,,,2014-08-26T16:31:52+00:00,1,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/1,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=116,116,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T13:59:20+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Open Access, Open Source",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/116

Bridging the Digital Divide: making the world’s cultural and scientific heritage accessible to all

The digital divide is an information divide
Bridging the digital divide is a key factor in achieving the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations. Access to information resources and the means of communication supports health and education as much as culturaland economic development.

The dissemination of information enables citizens to participate in life-long learning and education. Information about the world’s achievements allows everyone to participate constructively in the development of their own social environment.

Equal access to the cultural and scientific heritage of mankind is every person’s right and helps promote learning and understanding of the richness and diversity of the world, not only for the present generation, but also for the generations to come.

Libraries have long been essential agents in fostering peace and human values. Libraries now operate digitally, and their digital services open up a new channel to the universe of knowledge and information, connecting cultures across geographical and social boundaries.

Digital libraries
A digital library is an online collection of digital objects, of assured quality, that are created or collected and managed according to internationally accepted principles for collection development and made accessible in a coherent and sustainable manner, supported by services necessary to allow users to retrieve and exploit the resources.

A digital library forms an integral part of the services of a library, applying new technology to provide access to digital collections. Within a digital library collections are created, managed and made accessible in such a way that they are readily and economically available for use by a defined community or set of communities.

A collaborative digital library allows public and research libraries to form a network of digital information in response to the needs of the Information Society. The systems of all partners in a collaborative digital library must be able to interoperate.

A digital library complements digital archives and initiatives for the preservation of information resources.

Mission and Goals
The mission of the digital library is to give direct access to information resources, both digital and non-digital, in a structured and authoritative manner and thus to link information technology, education and culture in contemporary library service. To fulfil this mission the following goals are pursued:

Supporting digitisation, access to and preservation of cultural and scientific heritage.
Providing access for all users to the information resources collected by libraries, while respecting intellectual property rights.
Creating interoperable digital library systems to promote open standards and access.
Supporting the pivotal role of libraries and information services in the promotion of common standards and best practices.
Creating awareness of the urgent need to ensure the permanent accessibility of digital material.
Linking digital libraries to high-speed research and development networks.
Taking advantage of the increasing convergence of communications media and institutional roles to create and disseminate digital content.
Content creation, access and preservation
Building a digital library requires sources of content in digital form, whether digitised or born digital content.

Many countries have created national digitisation programmes, and more will do so, as agreed by the World Summit on the Information Society *. IFLA strongly supports and encourages both national and international digitisation strategies as well as single library and partnership initiatives. Digitisation allows the creation of virtual collections bringing together material across continents. Digitisation also has a preservation role in the case of deteriorating original documents and media.

The products of digitisation themselves must be preserved, just as born-digital material must be preserved. All digital library initiatives must include plans for digital preservation by an appropriate authority.

The digital library serves as an environment to bring together collections, services, and people in support of the full life cycle of creation, dissemination, use and preservation of data, information and knowledge.

Interoperability and sustainability are key to the vision of digital libraries able to communicate with each other. Digital libraries that conform to commonly agreed open standards and protocols improve world-wide knowledge dissemination and access.

Implementing the Manifesto
IFLA encourages national governments, intergovernmental organisations and sponsors to recognise the strategic importance of digital libraries and to actively support their development. Contributions to large-scale digitisation programmes serve to make cultural and scientific information resources more widely available, and advance national and international digital library initiatives that will be sustainable over time.

Specific legislation and financial support from national and local governments is required to bridge the digital divide and to ensure sustainable access. Any long-term strategy must aim to bridge the digital divide and to strengthen the development of education, literacy, culture - and most of all - to provide access to information.

Bridging the digital divide also implies the need for action by the appropriate authorities to incorporate information literacy into education curricula, and to raise awareness that much valuable information from the past is not in digital form.

IFLA encourages libraries to collaborate with other cultural and scientific heritage institutions to provide rich and diverse digital resources that support education and research, tourism and the creative industries.

Consultation with rights owners and other stakeholders is essential. Designers and implementers of digital libraries should consult fully with indigenous communities, whose tangible and intangible cultural heritage it is proposed to digitise, to ensure that their rights and wishes are respected. The implementation of the digital library must also support equity of access to the content by meeting the special needs of people with disabilities.

Authorities should be aware that active planning for digital libraries at any level (national, regional and local) should cover the following issues:

Trained personnel
Adequate buildings and facilities
Integrated planning for libraries and archives
Funding
Target setting
National e-strategies, as recommended by the World Summit on the Information Society **, could establish a firm basis for planning digital libraries.

""Markets are conversation. When you think of the Internet, don't think of Mack trucks full of widgets destined for distributorships, whizzing by countless billboards. Think of a table for two"". 
<http://www.cluetrain.com/book/markets.html>

""Markets are conversations"" is the first of the 95 theses of the Cluetrain Manifesto: the end of business as usual, a document published in 1999 that re-defines the nature and the typical processes of markets in the web age as conversations among human beings. In the context of networked on-line markets, corporations, producers, service providers and goods vendors are losing their central role and their capacity of mediating market demands, while individuals are now acquiring new powers and appear to be less and less the passive users or consumers of the past. According to the authors of the manifesto, the companies that aren't able to take part in these human ""conversations"" and speak the language of their markets are doomed to the side-lines. Acting on an idea of Giovanni Bergamin's, the Italian library Association (AIB) Working Group on digital libraries has tried to transfer these ideas into the context of digital libraries. The result is the following document, consisting of three parts (Principles, Models, Functions) and 30 theses.

 

A)   PRINCIPLES

1.   Digital libraries are conversations
This manifesto is about digital libraries, not THE Digital Library. Digital libraries are not a single system or grand systematic narrative; rather they consist of many conversations held together by a common language and a communicative structure which is based on different communities commitments to different groups of users.

2.   Digital libraries provide services
Digital libraries are communities that offer services to their users; they are distinguished according to their disciplinary specialization, geographical distribution or institutional affiliation.

3.   Digital libraries promote knowledge
Digital libraries must aim to support access to knowledge and help people exercise their rights as citizens, including that of life-long learning.

4.   Digital libraries are libraries
Like all other libraries, digital libraries can be defined as services that mediate the access to knowledge and are historically determined by the interrelation with their environment. In the specific context of the hybrid library, digital libraries must aim to integrate digital and non-digital resources in order to best create services that meet their users' needs.

5.   Digital libraries integrate communities
Digital libraries must functionally integrate the services offered by many different communities: archives, libraries, museums, educational and research institutions, public administrations, cultural businesses, and ITC industries.

6.   Digital libraires disseminate documents
Digital libraries must guarantee the conservation and the diffusion of all documents; among these are pre-prints, internal reports, teaching materials, research projects, experimental procedures, institutional records and other e-prints that would otherwise be relegated to the category of so-called ""grey literature"".

7.   Digital libraries respect everybody's rights
Digital libraries must seek fairness and balance between the rights and interests of intellectual property or copyright owners and the right of users to full and unimpeded access to knowledge. Digital libraries safeguard the individual's right to privacy as well.

8.   Digital Libraries share their problems with their communities
Digital libraries must establish an interactive relationship with their users: they must promote the active participation of individuals in community life and try to speak their language.

9.   Digital libraries hardly tolerate centralism
The old model of central control and administration has caused the failure of many digital libraries projects. Their coordinated development, on the other hand, is guaranteed by the adoption and diffusion of technological standards that ensure inter-operability and also by organizational models that promote co-operation.

10.   Digital libraries are on-line
All those who can access Internet are potential users of digital resources.

11.   Digital libraries are accessible
To ensure access to the largest number and variety of users, the infrastructures of digital libraries must facilitate finding and using all digital resources; this means implementing measures designed to combat the ""digital divide"" and respecting criteria of usability and accessibility of web sites, including multilingual solutions in order to guarantee worldwide content diffusion.

12.   Digital libraries make themselves known
Digital libraries ought to promote every aspect of their activities and teach their users about the correct use of services and resources.

13.   Digital libraries are open to discussion and innovations
Digital libraries must constantly evaluate ( through auditing, benchmarking) and update their structures, services and contents, in order to carry out their intended purposes in the most appropriate way and to direct their actions towards new emerging objectives.

14.   Digital libraries are funded in a transparent way
Funding assigned to digital libraries must be documented, transparent and publicized. All projects must be evaluated on the basis of their innovative characteristics and the benefits they provide to the public.

15.   Digital libraries have nothing to do with 'techeology'
Discussions about digital libraries often represent technological tools as mixture of ideology and technology, as though, i.e., they were the ultimate goals, and not simply a means, of providing services.

B)   MODELS

16.   Digital libraries have flexible models
The models of digital libraries must be flexible enough to be easily updated in accordance with technological innovations. They must be open to synergic integration with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) applications that go well beyond the specific field of digital libraries and archives (e-commerce, digital rights management, public key infrastructure, e-learning, e-government).

17.   Digital libraries consist of contents and services
Digital libraries are to be defined in terms of contents, services, users, providers and technologies. The contents, or resources, consist of digital objects and their metadata (descriptive, structural, technical, administrative, and those to do with conservation and rights management). The services make the digital objects available to the different communities of users according to the information provided by their metadata.

18.   The contents and the services are heterogeneous
Digital libraries contains different digital objects with different life-cycles. They may use different schemas of metadata and provide different services.

19.   The access to contents and services is homogeneous
Digital libraries must prefer advanced search interfaces that can provide integrated access to diverse and multimedial objects, thus permitting the retrieval of resources represented by different descriptive standards and belonging to different types of creative expressions.

20.   Digital libraries have a complex architecture based on standards
Fundamental architecture components are: 
a) web portals to present contents and services in an organized way; 
b) models (cross-searching, metadata harvesting, reference linking, ...); 
c) protocols (SRU/SRW, OAI-PMH, NISO OpenURL, ISO-ILL, LDAP, ...) and technological standards (HTTP, WebServices, XML, PKI, ...) that form the middleware for the integration of research services and access to Internet resources; 
d) standards of metadata (DC, MAG, ODRL, METS, MPEG-21, RDF, ...).

21.   Content and service providers interact
The infrastructure of digital libraries is based on the co-existence of a variety of digital repositories and service providers, according to the model as defined by the Open Archives Initiative (OAI). The repositories display descriptive and administrative metadata according to the OAI-PMH, and the service providers harvest them to implement disciplinary, institutional or territorial portals.

22.   The contents are organized in a variety of collections
Each repository may host one or more of the collections that content providers maintain in full autonomy. Incentives must be given to co-operation initiatives, however, for the purpose of harmonizing contents and reducing duplications.

23.   Access and fruition are decided in autonomy
The content providers responsible for the repositories autonomously decide the access and usage policies to be applied to the different service providers, according to the type of resource or service and the different groups of users.

C)   FUNCTIONS

24.   Digital libraries focus on users
They take advantage of the technology of portals and users' registration, profiling authentication and authorization to integrate retrieval, search, localization and access services with users' guides and instructions, selected content lists, customization of the interfaces and personal web spaces.

25.   Digital libraries maintain a relationship with education systems and academic and research institutions
Digital libraries freely offer their repositories and their services for accessing digital resources in support of the activities -- especially e-learning -- of education and research institutions at all levels.

26.   Digital libraries co-operate to preserve the digital cultural heritage
In line with legislation on legal deposit, certain repositories are committed to the permanent preservation (or necessary weeding out) of digital cultural heritage. In this respect, they co-operate and integrate their functions, adopting the most suitable standards (i.e. Open Archival Information System, OAIS ISO 14721). At the same time, legal depositories implement the technology that best guarantees data conservation and long-term readability.

27.   The ""Digital Libraries National Portal"" is the access point for the services offered by the different providers
The Digital Libraries National Portal provides a homogeneous access point for the various service providers and offers an integrated view of the resources available on a national level. It must function as a meta-index and national directory.

28.   The adoption of open source software and open standards help the diffusion of digital contents.
To help the diffusion of the contents of the digital collections, it is vital to promote the adoption and the development of open source software and standards that could contribute to overcome access barriers, instead of creating new ones.

29.   The communities of digital libraries share management utilities and services
Appropriate services must be developed, tested and managed co-operatively for the attribution of univocal and enduring identifiers to digital resources, for digital rights management (DRM) and for the creation of commonly shared thesauri.

30.   Digital libraries promote their functional integration with search engines
Digital libraries must promote the establishment of functional relationships with search engines, in the role of aggregators and distributors of metadata on digital resources.",<em>The Digital Libraries Manifesto</em>,,,,2014-08-27T16:12:12+00:00,7,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/7,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=119,119,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T13:58:11+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Digital Literacy, Digital Preservation",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/119

""Le livre, comme livre, appartient à l’auteur, mais comme pensée, il appartient—le mot n’est pas trop vaste—au genre humain. Toutes les intelligences y ont droit. Si l’un des deux droits, le droit de l’écrivain et le droit de l’esprit humain, devait être sacrifié, ce serait, certes, le droit de l’écrivain, car l’intérêt public est notre préoccupation unique, et tous, je le déclare, doivent passer avant nous."" (Victor Hugo, Discours d’ouverture du Congrès littéraire international de 1878, 1878) 

""Our markets, our democracy, our science, our traditions of free speech, and our art all depend more heavily on a Public Domain of freely available material than they do on the informational material that is covered by property rights. The Public Domain is not some gummy residue left behind when all the good stuff has been covered by property law. The Public Domain is the place we  quarry the building blocks of our culture. It is, in fact, the majority of our culture."" (James Boyle, The Public Domain, p.40f, 2008)  

The public domain, as we understand it, is the wealth of information that is free from the barriers to access or reuse usually associated with copyright protection, either because it is free from any copyright protection or because the right holders have decided to remove these barriers. It is the basis of our self-understanding as expressed by our shared knowledge and culture. It is the raw material from which new knowledge is derived and new cultural works are created. The Public Domain acts as a protective mechanism that ensures that this raw material is available at its cost of reproduction - close to zero - and that all members of society can build upon it. Having a healthy and thriving Public Domain is essential to the social and economic well-being of our societies. The Public Domain plays a capital role in the fields of education, science, cultural heritage and public sector information. A healthy and thriving Public Domain is one of the prerequisites for ensuring that the principles of Article 27 (1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ('Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.') can be enjoyed by everyone around the world.

The digital networked information society has brought the issue of the Public Domain to the foreground of copyright discussions. In order to preserve and strengthen the Public Domain we need a robust and up-to-date understanding of the nature and role of this essential resource. This Public Domain Manifesto defines the Public Domain and outlines the necessary principles and guidelines for a healthy Public Domain at the beginning of the 21st century. The Public Domain is considered here in its relation to copyright law, to the exclusion of other intellectual property rights (like patents and trademarks), and where  copyright law is to be understood in its broadest sense to include economic and moral rights under copyright and related rights (inclusive of neighboring rights and database rights). In the remainder of this document copyright is therefore used as a catch-all term for these rights. Moreover, the term 'works' includes all subject-matter protected by copyright so defined, thus including databases, performances and recordings. Likewise, the term 'authors' includes photographers, producers, broadcasters, painters and performers. 

The Public Domain in the 21st Century 
The Public Domain as aspired to in this Manifesto is defined as cultural material that can be used without restriction, absent copyright protection. In addition to works that are formally in the public domain, there are also lots of valuable works that individuals have voluntarily shared under generous terms creating a privately constructed commons that functions in many ways like the public domain. Moreover, individuals can also make use of many protected works through exceptions and limitations to copyright, fair use and fair dealing. All of these sources that allow for increased access to our  culture and heritage are important and all need to be actively maintained in order for society to reap the full benefit of our shared knowledge and culture.

The Public Domain
The structural Public Domain lies at the core of the notion of the Public Domain and is comprised of our shared knowledge, culture and resources that can be used without copyright restrictions by virtue of current law. Specifically, the structural Public Domain is made up of two different classes of material:

1.    Works of authorship where the copyright protection has expired. Copyright is a temporary right granted to authors. Once this temporary protection has come to its end, all legal restrictions cease to exist, subject in some countries to the author's perpetual moral rights. 
 
2.    The essential commons of information that is not covered by copyright. Works that are not protected by copyright because they fail the test of originality, or are excluded from protection (such as data, facts, ideas, procedures, processes, systems, methods of operation, concepts, principles, or discoveries, regardless of the form in which they are described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in a work, as well as laws and judicial and administrative decisions). This essential commons is too important for the functioning of our societies to be burdened with legal restrictions of any nature even for a limited period.
 
The structural Public Domain is an historically grown balance to the rights of authors protected by copyright and it is essential to the cultural memory and knowledge base of our societies. In the second half of the 20th century all two elements identified here have been strained by the extension of the term of copyright protection and the introduction of more copyright-like regimes of legal protection.

Voluntary commons and user prerogatives
In addition to this structural core of the Public Domain, there are other essential sources that enable individuals to freely interact with copyright protected works. These represent the ""breathing space"" of our current culture and knowledge, ensuring that copyright protection does not interfere with specific requirements of society and the voluntary choices of authors. While these sources  increase access to protected works, some of them make this access conditional on certain forms of use or restrict access to certain classes of users:

1.    Works that are voluntarily shared by their rights holders. Creators can remove use restrictions from their works by either freely licensing them, or by using other legal tools to allow others to use their works without restrictions, or by dedicating them to the Public Domain. For free licencing definitions see the definition of free software http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html, the definition of free cultural works http://freedomdefined.org/Definition, and the open knowledge definition http://opendefinition.org/1.0/ for reference.
 
2.    The user prerogatives created by exceptions and limitations to copyright, fair use and fair dealing. These prerogatives are an integral part of the Public Domain. They ensure that there is sufficient access to our shared culture and knowledge, enabling the functioning of essential social institutions and enabling social participation of individuals with special needs.

Taken together, the public domain, the voluntary sharing of works and exceptions and limitations to copyright, fair use and fair dealing go a long way to ensure  that everyone has access to our shared culture and knowledge in order to facilitate innovation and cultural participation for the benefit of the entire society. It is therefore important that the Public Domain in both its incarnations is actively maintained so that it can continue to fulfill this key role in this period of rapid technological and social change.

General Principles 
In a period of rapid technological and social change the Public Domain fulfills an essential role in cultural participation and digital innovation, and therefore needs to be actively maintained. Active maintenance of the Public Domain needs to take into account a number of general principles. The following principles are essential to preserve a meaningful understanding of the Public Domain and to ensure that the Public Domain continues to function in the technological environment of the networked information society. With regard to the structural Public Domain these are as follows:

1.    The Public Domain is the rule, copyright protection is the exception.  Since copyright protection is granted only with respect to original forms of expression, the vast majority of data, information and ideas produced worldwide at any given time belongs to the Public Domain. In addition to information that is not eligible for protection, the Public Domain is enlarged every year by works whose term of protection expires. The combined application of the requirements for protection and the limited duration of the copyright protection contribute to the wealth of the Public Domain so as to ensure access to our shared culture and knowledge.  
 
2.    Copyright protection should last only as long as necessary to achieve a reasonable compromise between protecting and rewarding the author for his intellectual labour and safeguarding the public interest in the dissemination of culture and knowledge. From neither the perspective of the author nor the general public do any valid arguments exist (whether historical, economic, social or otherwise) in support of an exceedingly long term of copyright protection. While the author should be able to reap the fruits of his intellectual labour, the general public should not be deprived for an overly long period of time of the benefits of freely using those works.
 
3.    What is in the Public Domain must remain in the Public Domain. Exclusive control over Public Domain works must not be reestablished by claiming exclusive rights in technical reproductions of the works, or using technical protection measures to limit access to technical reproductions of such works.
 
4.    The lawful user of a digital copy of a Public Domain work should be free to (re-)use, copy and modify such work. The Public Domain status of a work does not necessarily mean that it must be made accessible to the public. The owners of physical works that are in the Public Domain are free to restrict access to such works. However once access to a work has been granted then there ought not be legal restrictions on the re-use, modification or reproduction of these works.
 
5.    Contracts or technical protection measures that restrict access to and re-use of Public Domain works must not be enforced. The Public Domain status of a work guarantees the right to re-use, modify and reproduce. This also includes user prerogatives arising from exceptions and limitations, fair use and fair dealing, ensuring that these cannot be limited by contractual or technological means.
 
In addition, the following principles are at the core of the voluntary commons and user prerogatives described above:

1.    The voluntary relinquishment of copyright and sharing of protected works are legitimate exercises of copyright exclusivity. Many authors entitled to copyright protection for their works do not wish to exercise these rights to their full extent or wish to relinquish these rights altogether. Such actions, provided that they are voluntary, are a legitimate exercise of copyright exclusivity and must not be hindered by law, by statute or by other mechanisms including moral rights. 
 
2.    Exceptions and limitations to copyright, fair use and fair dealing need to be actively maintained to ensure the effectiveness of the fundamental balance of copyright and the public interest. These mechanisms create user prerogatives that constitute the breathing space within the current copyright system. Given the rapid pace of change in both technology and society it is important that they remain capable of ensuring the functioning of essential social institutions and the social participation of individuals with special needs. Therefore, exceptions and limitations to copyright, fair use and fair dealing should be construed as evolutionary in nature and constantly adapted to account for the public interest.

In addition to these general principles, a number of issues relevant to the Public Domain must be addressed immediately. The following recommendations are aimed at protecting the Public Domain and ensuring that it can continue to function in a meaningful way. While these recommendations are applicable across the spectrum of copyright, they are of particular relevance to education, cultural heritage and scientific research.

General Recommendations
1.    The term of copyright protection should be reduced. The excessive length of copyright protection combined with an absence of formalities is highly detrimental to the accessibility of our shared knowledge and culture. Moreover, it increases the occurrence of orphan works, works that are neither under the control of their authors nor part of the Public Domain, and in either case cannot be used. Thus, for new works the duration of copyright protection should be reduced to a more reasonable term.
 
2.   Any change to the scope of copyright protection (including any new definition of protectable subject-matter or expansion of exclusive rights) needs to take into account the effects on the Public Domain. Any change of the scope of copyright protection must not be applied retroactively to works already subject to protection. Copyright is a time-limited exception to the Public Domain status of our shared culture and knowledge. In the 20th century its scope has been significantly extended, to accommodate the interests of a small class of rights holders at the expense of the general public. As a result, most of our shared culture and knowledge is locked away behind copyright and technical restrictions.  We must ensure that this situation will not be worsened at a minimum, and be affirmatively improved in the future.
 
3.    When material is deemed to fall in the structural Public Domain in its country of origin, the material should be recognized as part of the structural Public Domain in all other countries of the world. Where material in one country is not eligible for copyright protection because it falls under a specific copyright exclusion, either because it does not meet the criterion of originality or because the duration of its protection has lapsed, it should not be possible for anyone (including the author) to invoke copyright protection on the same material in another country so as to withdraw this material from the structural Public Domain.
 
4.    Any false or misleading attempt to misappropriate Public Domain material must be legally punished. In order to preserve the integrity of the Public Domain and protect users of Public Domain material from inaccurate and deceitful representations, any false or misleading attempts to claim exclusivity over Public Domain material must be declared unlawful.
 
5.    No other intellectual property right must be used to reconstitute exclusivity over Public Domain material. The Public Domain is integral to the internal balance of the copyright system. This internal balance must not be manipulated by attempts to reconstitute or obtain exclusive control via regulations that are external to copyright.
 
6.    There must be a practical and effective path to make available 'orphan works' and published works that are no longer commercially available (such as out-of-print works) for re-use by society. The extension of the scope and duration of copyright and the prohibition of formalities for foreign works have created a huge body of orphan works that are neither under the control of their authors nor part of the Public Domain. Given that such works under current law do not benefit their authors or society, these works need to be made available for productive re-use by society as a whole. 
 
7.    Cultural heritage institutions should take upon themselves a special role in the effective labeling and preserving of Public Domain works. Not-for-profit cultural heritage organizations  have been entrusted with preservation of our shared knowledge and culture for centuries. As part of this role they need to ensure that works in the Public Domain are available to all of society, by labeling them, preserving them and making them freely available. 
 
8.    There must be no legal obstacles that prevent the voluntary sharing of works or the dedication of works to the Public Domain. Both are legitimate exercises of exclusive rights granted by copyright and both are critical to ensuring access to essential cultural goods and knowledge and to respecting authors' wishes.
 
9.    Personal non-commercial uses of protected works must generally be made possible, for which alternative modes of remuneration for the author must be explored. While it is essential for the self-development of each individual that he or she be able to make personal non-commercial uses of works, it is just as essential that the position of the author be taken into consideration when establishing new limitations and exceptions on copyright or revising old ones.

Why I Weblog

A rumination on where the hell I’m going with this website

About a year ago, I took the plunge and set up my own domain name. It was a practical decision, the result of having been buffeted from ISP to ISP by poor customer service, busy signals and escalating service fees. I felt the need to have a static e-mail address that I could feel safe printing on stationery and carry with me in my nomadic quest for the perfect provider.

After electing to register ""bradlands.com,"" the urge to publish on the net returned in spades. I’ve had a personal site called ""The BradLands"" off and on for six or seven years, since I first dipped my toe in the waters of HTML using America Online‘s clunky FTP space to serve a few vanity pages.

The BradLands have (has?) been, by turns:

a fairly typical and boring home page, outlining my interest, with obligatory links to some ""cool sites"" and with pictures of my friends;
a somewhat more ambitious attempt to collect all of my writings, online and off, in one linked space;
a poorly realized city guide to my fair city, St. Louis, back when there were few others;
and, finally, the personal home page again, showing severe signs of infrequent updating and terminal link rot.
But here I was with a brand-new domain name and a need to show it off. I’ve always been prone to publishing in one form or another. An early indicator of my predisposition for journalism can be found among my parents’ scrapbooks: it’s a two page ""family newsletter"" I wrote longhand on legal paper when I was four or five years old, photocopied on my mom’s mammoth IBM copier and distributed to interested readers.

Total circulation: two. Mom. Dad. Well, color me a magnate.

A few months before I threw up my hands and uttered a few colorful curses when my then-provider’s local POP pooped out for the umpteenth time, I had started reading Steve Bogart’s personal website, News, Pointers and Commentary (now NowThis).

Steve used to perform in an a capella group called MACH 1. I saw them perform one night at Washington University, then checked out their site when I got home. His personal site was linked from there, and I discovered we had some common interests. His main page was updated frequently, in a fashion called ""news page"" or ""web log,"" so I checked back from time to time and enjoyed his pointers to other web reading and his personal ""scribbles"" about computing issues and other topics. (A side note: For those of you keeping score at home, I’ve been reading Steve’s page for more than a year. He works right down the street from me. We’ve never met, and have only just started a little e-mail correspondence. It’s a small world sometimes. And sometimes, it’s a wide one too. <grin>)

From Steve’s page, I followed a link to Jorn Barger’s Robot Wisdom Weblog, and Jorn’s page led me to Raphael Carter’s Honeyguide and...well, from there the trail gets a little murky. Suffice it to say, I started reading these weblogs regularly and, eventually, decided to start one of my own.

The BradLands, version 3.0 (or so) was born, June 1998.

The early style of my weblog was wholly aped (OK, stolen) from Steve’s page: a quote du jour, a few links, now and then a rant. As I continued to write for myself and audience of two or three readers a day, I also explored other sites that were maintaining similar pages.

Even though I was not, like Steve and Jorn, using Frontier to maintain my site, I became a regular reader of Dave Winer’s Scripting News. I discovered Cameron Barrett’s CamWorld, Peter Merholz’s PeterMe, Lawrence Lee’s Tomalak’s Realm and Bill Humphries’ More Like This.

And, in the recent revamp of The BradLands, I borrowed (OK, stole) extensively from each of them to create the format I use today.

The BradLands still has a weblog; it’s the page you’re greeted with when you visit bradlands.com. I’ve added sections for my old published writing (incomplete, but growing), my new web-based essays, my current and all-time favorite books, and a few other bits I’ve yet to develop. Laurel Krahn, proprietor of the ""Homicide: Life on the Street""-centric Minneapolis-based Windowseat called what I do a ""web home"" when she noted its appearance in her own weblog. I suppose that’s as apt a description of The BradLands as any.

But at the heart of it--posted right on the front door--is my weblog, infrequent though it may be, updating readers (now numbering about 60 per day) about projects I’m working on, links I find interesting, topics for discussion.

As The BradLands grew over the last year, more and more folks have started weblogs of their own, some with specific topics around which they focus, others more general in nature. There’s a whole category for the breed in NewHoo and other web directories are taking note the ""weblog phenomenon.""

At the same time, there’s been some navel-gazing among those of us who maintain these sorts of pages, pondering why we do what we do the way we do it. Some folks have tried to define just what comprises a weblog; the definitions range narrow to wide. Cam had one of the better, I thought.

Rather than add my voice to the fray and debate what is and is not a proper weblog, or to contemplate what purpose such a thing might serve for the web community at large, I’ve been thinking about why I do it. Whether I’ll continue. What shape The BradLands will take if I do.

Call it ""The BradLand Manifesto,"" or, if you like, ""Why I Weblog"":

The aforementioned need to publish: I get off on seeing my words in print. My first byline in a daily newspaper almost made me wet myself with glee. More than that, I like the notion of leaving my words behind--even given the relatively ephemeral nature of the web--for others to find and enjoy.

A desire to minimize ""fram"": About the 15th time I received forwarded e-mail about ""Why the Internet is like a penis"" or a plea for a terminally-ill child who wants to receive greeting cards to make a world’s record, I vowed never ever to forward a joke, petition or other long-winded e-mail to my entire address book. I get about 20 pieces of mail like this everyday, often the same thing from several different folks around the country. (A wry observer called this propagation of forwarded mail ""fram,"" a coinage denoting ""spam from friends."") Instead of blindly cc’ing everyone I know, if I think it’s worthy of passing on, I try to track down the original source on the web (’cause it’s there somewhere!) and either post the URL in my weblog or e-mail just one or two folks I know who’ll truly to be interested. As a result, I don’t clutter my friend’s in-boxes and folks who know me well also know they can check out my website to see if anything truly noteworthy as come my way.

An opportunity to learn: This isn’t strictly a motivation for my weblog, but it’s a happy consequence. I got my first taste of HTML and web publishing during my brief stint as a tech writer. My first few pages were hand-coded in vi, and gave me a chance to learn the lingo from the ground up. Although these days, I tend to rely on WYSIWYG tools for most of the heavy-lifting, I’m still continuing to learn about markup by tweaking things by hand. I’m also getting some good insight into things such as how search engines work (or don’t), how to grok JavaScript and--a leisurely summer provided--how to automate some stuff with scripting. I’m picking up cool skills in a pleasurable way that may have some real-world application down the line. A spoonful of sugar, and all that.

A license to explore: I spend a lot of time on the Internet, probably 2-3 hours a day all told reading for pleasure, maybe another hour or so on strictly work-related matters. I’ve more or less transferred my real-world habit of reading three newspapers a day to the web, only now I skim more like 25-30 publications regularly. I’m reading more and enjoying it. Still, using my weblog to link to stuff I’ve discovered in my surfing ameliorates some of my guilt about spending so much time in front of the screen. Surfing the Internet is fun, learning new things and discovering new resources is cool, and sharing the wealth with my weblog readers is a joy.

A sense of community: The first time I had a sense of the Internet as a place to convene a community was as a lurker and occasional poster on Usenet. As malicious and merely injudicious cross-posting unacceptably raised the newsgroup signal-to-noise ratio, I rediscovered that same feeling on a few, well-chosen e-mail lists, to which I contributed more often. I’ve skimmed back the number of lists I subscribe to, but I still have a sense of community on the Internet, and it’s largely a community I’ve created and nurtured myself. People who read The BradLands write to me to share links they think I might enjoy. Sometimes, things I mention in my weblog show up in other folks’ weblogs too, with credit to me for pointing the way. Cameron Barrett has created the best of both worlds with his CamList, a mailing list for readers of his weblog. My weblog is linked from several others, and theirs from mine. We are a community, of sorts, a small town sharing gossip and news, recreation and sport, laughter and tears, all for the commonweal. And, for the most part, we’re friendly to strangers.

It’s that last part that’s distressing to some folks who’ve taken a step back and looked at the relatively young practice of weblogging. The tendency of identical or similar links to show up in several different logs, and the frequency of reciprocal links among webloggers is seen as perhaps unhealthy, a form of incest that---we’re told---can lead to a flattened sameness among our pages.

I haven’t seen anything approaching a day when all of the dozen or so weblogs I read daily have completely identical links. On the occasions when two or more of us point to the same stories, well, it’s because those are the big stories on the ‘net (or at least among geeks) that day. It’s no different than those occasions when channels 2, 4, 5, 8 and 11 all lead with the same feature on the evening news.

In fact, in the offline world, that sort of thing is much more common. Our weblogs, by contrast, are incredible in their manifold diversity.

Those who would dismiss weblogging as a pointless self-referrential exercise or, in vulgar parlance, a big ol’ Internet-based circle jerk, aren’t looking toward the future.

I am. Over the next few months, I’ll be narrowing the focus of The BradLands somewhat, limiting the topics that are regularly noted in the weblog to those that most interest me. (How limiting this is remains to be seen; I have quite catholic interests.) But, with time, The BradLands will evolve with an unique voice, a definite attitude, a clearer motivation.

Meanwhile, other folks will be starting weblogs of their own, defined by their own interests, published with their own voices. As more and more do so, the weblog movement will begin to realize its true power, a more widely distributed version of what the Open Directory and other collaborative web directories have promised but only minimally delivered.

Hundreds of individuals, sorting through the Internet, pointing to the links that they find interesting and that they believe would interest their friends and colleagues and a few bystanders besides.

Sure, two or four or more of us will point to the same ""big story"" from time to time, or even to the same ""small story."" That’s OK. I have a different set of readers than Laurel does, and she attracts a different crowd than Cam, and Jorn has yet another audience. There’s some overlap, but there’s a whole lot of difference too, because we’re different people.

An old maxim states that editors separate the wheat from the chaff and then publish the chaff.

As the weblog movement matures, our sites will wrest editorial authority the few editors of today and divide it among the many. ""They"" can continue to publish the chaff; we’ll be there to point our hungry readers toward the wheat. Hopefully, we’ll have fun doing it and learn a lot along the way.

And that, my friends, is why I weblog.","<em>The BradLand Manifesto, or, Why I Weblog</em>",,,,2014-08-29T15:19:07+00:00,3,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/3,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=121,121,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T13:57:46+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Blogging, Digital Composition",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/121

It calls for the creation of international funding structures and institutional support to meet this growing need.,,,EN,,,,"<a href=""http://www.mediaarthistory.org/"">http://www.mediaarthistory.org/</a>",,Copyright Media Art History,"<a href=""http://www.mediaarthistory.org/declaration"">http://www.mediaarthistory.org/declaration</a>","Media Archaeology, Digital Preservation","MEDIA ART NEEDS GLOBAL NETWORKED ORGANISATION & SUPPORT – International Declaration  

State of Affairs

Digital technology has fundamentally changed the way art is made. Over the last forty years, Media Art has become a significant part of our networked information society. Although there are well-attended international festivals, collaborative research projects, exhibitions and database documentation resources, Media Art research is still marginal in universities, museums and archives. It remains largely under-resourced in our core cultural institutions.

As a result of rapid changes in technology, many major works made even 10 years ago can no longer be shown or are disappearing without a trace. If this situation is not addressed, we face losing an art form that is a central part of our post-industrial digital culture. To date, systematic global preservation and documentation campaigns do not exist.

Many important online documentation and research projects are also disappearing from the web. As they falter, we risk losing their valuable material forever. Contemporary scientific research relies on access to shared data. The same is true of the Arts and Humanities, which lack a concerted international policy for sustainability and support of the digital heritage, such as exists partly in the natural sciences.

Several science disciplines have developed large collective projects to address the challenges and opportunities of our time by way of networked digital environments, based on a sustainable and international support structure. International Media Art research needs similar global organisation and collaboration.

Goals

a.) Establish international and sustainable funding structures
Therefore it is essential to establish international and sustainable funding structures that can guarantee the persistence of these valuable resources, and to make use of networked collaboration to archive key data in a cooperative process of knowledge transfer between artists, institutions and researchers internationally. While many nations are devoting funds for interdisciplinary e-research, we urgently need global networked collaboration in Media Art research.
Such an international structure/alliance needs the actively supported membership of media art organisations, archives and individuals. It should be supported with adequate funding and expertise from the existing networks of funding agencies, archives, online initiatives and research institutions.

b.) Supporting an International Association/Institution for Shared Data
We urgently need global networked collaboration in Media Art research across the aforementioned networks. We need as many bridges into society as possible: archives, conferences, text repositories, collective database documentation, and preservation.

This alliance will promote collaboration and advocate the sustainability, understanding and appreciation of media art heritage by:
·      Recognizing and building upon existing knowledge and resources
·      Providing and fostering channels of communication
·      Enabling the international research community to create/upload/access data to be shared.
·      Encouraging peer exchange and addressing the new challenges of Media Art
·      Developing scientific technologies for documentation and preservation of Media Art
·      Providing inspiration and resources for curators, artists, scholars, educators and audiences
·      Supporting the Media Art History network, its conference series, text repositories and scientific publications
·      Promotion of new ways of understanding media art, science, technology and its histories

Only when we develop systematic strategies to address these challenges will we be able to fulfill the task that digital culture and its research demands of us in the 21st Century.",<em>MEDIA ART NEEDS GLOBAL NETWORKED ORGANISATION &amp; SUPPORT – International Declaration</em>,,,,2014-08-29T15:34:14+00:00,7,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/7,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=122,122,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T13:57:32+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Digital Preservation, Media Archaeology",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/122

""Wherever progress is measured in terms of technology and not in terms of right understanding, the perfecting of the machine rather than of persons will be the guiding ideal.""
- W.Y. Evans-Wentz

What is cyborganic? Cyber-organic: a blending of technology (the ruling star of our culture) and our organic natures (as beings hell-bent on making meaning, art, love, communities, and mischief ;-) The cyborganic enterprise is governed by one broad idea which can be understood as follows.
The Greek word techne means ""art, skill, craft"", yet everywhere in our world, in our ordinary understanding, technology has come to mean the tools themselves, rather than the craftsman; the machine, and perhaps the artistry of those who made it, but not the artistry of those who use it. We have, then, an impoverished understanding: art without artists, skill without people, craft without craftsmen.
Cyborganic opposes this sterile vision with the radical idea that technology is about people.

Cyborganic says conventional attitudes towards technology are backward. They put the horse before the cart, inventing tools without vision of the task at hand. Case in point: the World Wide Web came into existence as a form well before there was a full sense of the ends to which we might put it; a full sense of the kind of communications we might make with it.
We're all wired-up with no place to go.

The problem today is not to invent new tools, but to invent new ways of using the tools at hand. There are those who would use new telecommunications media in ways that serve to make us ever more remote from one another. Likely, this approach is taken from force of habit, rather than misanthropy.
There are many more for whom our new technologies foretell a nightmare future, Big Brother or Mad Max, depending on your taste. A future of domination, in any case, featuring hi-tech warfare, with the all the latest techno-goodies and some good old-fashioned gore. To be sure, this nightmare world has entertainment value. Our dark fantasies of technology are often very sexy. But they betray our fears of having set in motion processes we can no longer control. We must awake to see that these are our tools, not our masters.

We must use them to serve our own ends, not as ends in themselves, and we must work together to build a future we want, in our imaginations and in our lives.

This is the Cyborganic vision. This is the Cyborganic mission.

A Manifesto for the Essay Film

1.
A fiction film is a bubble. An essay film bursts it.

2.
An essay film takes an idea for a walk.

3.
Essay films are visual thinking.

4.
Essay films reverse film production: the images come first, the script, last.

5.
Filming an essay is gathering, like a carpenter gathers wood.

6.
A fiction film is a car, an essay film is a bike; it can nip up an alleyway, you can feel the wind in its hair.

7.
A road movie has outer movement, an essay film has inner movement.

8.
An essay film is the opposite of fly on the wall.

9.
An essay film can go anywhere, and should.

10.
Two essay films should be made every year. Why? Because, after F for Fake, Orson Welles said this to Henry Jaglom during lunch at Ma Maison: “I could have made an essay film – two of ‘em a year, you see. On different subjects. Various variations of that form.”

11.
Commentary is to the essay film, what dance is to the musical.

12.
All essay films would be improved by a clip of Dietrich (see Marcel Ophuls).

13.
An essay film cannot create the atmosphere of Wilder’s Sunset Boulevard;
A fiction film cannot explain that atmosphere.

14.
Even Hollywood makes essay films – look at DW Griffith’s Intolerance.

15.
Essay films are what Astruc dreamt of.

The arithmetic magicians of old did not know what fire they handled, what heat they hefted, when they considered the humble ’1′ and the mystical ’0′. Certainly, they knew of power there, but none could have guessed what this dynamic digital duo would be up to come the 21st century.  Indeed, heroic ‘one’ and the Enkidu ‘zero’ are a pair on a journey – and we are all along, passenger and crew.

The recent achievements of this binary couplet are many – but one in particular concerns us here.  Binary has (re)turned content into a fluid. By content, I mean the stuff we generate to fill pages and the grey between our ears.  Story telling, information transmission, all outward expression has been touched and transformed by digitization.

In the centuries-long epoch before alphabets and well before Guttenburg’s galaxy was colonized, story telling and information sharing were accomplished the old fashioned way – orally. Communication streams were fluid and rarely replicated with real precision.  Instead, oral histories and story traditions flowed from central tenants, varied in the telling as they flowed through time.  Communication was an act of memory, social interactivity, creativity, and present-tense, multisensual contexts (i.e. communicating by the hot fire, near those frog-chirpy trees, under the ruddy sunset sky…).

Alphabets solidified the stream.  They freeze the words in place forever, allowing a message to exist independently of the physical presence of the human messenger. Vellum, paper, and clay all substitute for a present-tense story teller, vibrations of air, and semiotic eyebrows.  As we’ve written in earlier posts, the wide spread of the paper codex eclipses orality with a print culture – one that puts the static paper book and its alphabetic encoding at the center of information transfer and story telling.  And this exchange has been at the center of civilization for some 10,000 years.

Things are different now. The advent of binary immediately disintermediated content from container.  And content is a multisensual stream once again.  Digital storage and design allows for the innovation of powerful forms of content delivery. These are post-book opportunities. These new forms allow for a return of the fluidity of yore.  Databases and APIs create a massive open memory archive.  Well-designed user interfaces allow access and amendment to multiple content forms and feeds.

These are our assertions:

We are post-book.  Digital affords us the opportunity to express book content in new effective forms and contexts.  The paper book is an object and as such is easily attended to with object metaphors.  Post-book artifacts and experiences are better characterized with stream metaphors.  Books are visual and tactile objects hinged, strung, and stitched into existence; post-books are engineered watershed ecosystems with multiple content streams and multisensual experiences.

Post-book artifacts and experiences provide
1. multifarious content
2. fluidity over fixity
3. sensuality over monosensual experience
4. multiple content streams
5. dynamic and social marginalia

Post-book content should follow the what we will call the “Daly Principle” after the writings of Liza Daly.  The principle may be stated thusly:  If a post-book work has a central content stream, the additional streams must be:

1. Nontrivial: natural and useful extensions of the central content such as primary source material, obscure topics, deep dives into related topics. These may be provided by the central content author, publisher, or other users. third parties.

2. Immersive: natural and useful extensions of the central content made available to the user “at the moment that these curiosities naturally arrive in the course of consuming the text.”

As a place rather then object, the post-book enables readers (users, visitors?) to co-author the text as well.  The content of a post-book experience may be authored by professional authors, the publisher, or readers.

Everything we state is already evident in the simplest of web pages. Hell, it was true of any MySpace page in 2001. It is true of several notable experiments with reading apps.  We are not calling for the invention of anything new.  Rather, we would like to bring these elements to bear directly on innovations in 1) digital storytelling vessels and 2) the mission statements of publishing companies old and new. Robust and courageous experimentation will yield the future.

By the way, we personally dislike the phrase post-book as a real name for what we describe – it is backwards-facing,  skeuomorphic, and hyphenated. We only employ it here for lack of the imagination to devise a better term.  Whosoever provides a better nomenclature for these new digital reading experiences wins a free phonebook…

Unlocking the promise of open educational resources

 We are on the cusp of a global revolution in teaching and learning. Educators worldwide are developing a vast pool of educational resources on the Internet, open and free for all to use. These educators are creating a world where each and every person on earth can access and contribute to the sum of all human knowledge. They are also planting the seeds of a new pedagogy where educators and learners create, shape and evolve knowledge together, deepening their skills and understanding as they go.

This emerging open education movement combines the established tradition of sharing good ideas with fellow educators and the collaborative, interactive culture of the Internet. It is built on the belief that everyone should have the freedom to use, customize, improve and redistribute educational resources without constraint. Educators, learners and others who share this belief are gathering together as part of a worldwide effort to make education both more accessible and more effective.

The expanding global collection of open educational resources has created fertile ground for this effort. These resources include openly licensed course materials, lesson plans, textbooks, games, software and other materials that support teaching and learning. They contribute to making education more accessible, especially where money for learning materials is scarce. They also nourish the kind of participatory culture of learning, creating, sharing and cooperation that rapidly changing knowledge societies need.

However, open education is not limited to just open educational resources. It also draws upon open technologies that facilitate collaborative, flexible learning and the open sharing of teaching practices that empower educators to benefit from the best ideas of their colleagues. It may also grow to include new approaches to assessment, accreditation and collaborative learning. Understanding and embracing innovations like these is critical to the long term vision of this movement.

There are many barriers to realizing this vision. Most educators remain unaware of the growing pool of open educational resources. Many governments and educational institutions are either unaware or unconvinced of the benefits of open education. Differences among licensing schemes for open resources create confusion and incompatibility. And, of course, the majority of the world does not yet have access to the computers and networks that are integral to most current open education efforts.

These barriers can be overcome, but only by working together. We invite learners, educators, trainers, authors, schools, colleges, universities, publishers, unions, professional societies, policymakers, governments, foundations and others who share our vision to commit to the pursuit and promotion of open education and, in particular, to these three strategies to increase the reach and impact of open educational resources:

1. Educators and learners: First, we encourage educators and learners to actively participate in the emerging open education movement. Participating includes: creating, using, adapting and improving open educational resources; embracing educational practices built around collaboration, discovery and the creation of knowledge; and inviting peers and colleagues to get involved. Creating and using open resources should be considered integral to education and should be supported and rewarded accordingly.

2. Open educational resources: Second, we call on educators, authors, publishers and institutions to release their resources openly. These open educational resources should be freely shared through open 
licences which facilitate use, revision, translation, improvement and sharing by anyone. Resources should be published in formats that facilitate both use and editing, and that accommodate a diversity of technical platforms. Whenever possible, they should also be available in formats that are accessible to people with disabilities and people who do not yet have access to the Internet.

3. Open education policy: Third, governments, school boards, colleges and universities should make open education a high priority. Ideally, taxpayer-funded educational resources should be open educational resources. Accreditation and adoption processes should give preference to open educational resources. Educational resource repositories should actively include and highlight open educational resources within their collections.

These strategies represent more than just the right thing to do. They constitute a wise investment in teaching and learning for the 21st century. They will make it possible to redirect funds from expensive textbooks towards better learning. They will help teachers excel in their work and provide new opportunities for visibility and global impact. They will accelerate innovation in teaching. They will give more control over learning to the learners themselves. These are strategies that make sense for everyone.

Thousands of educators, learners, authors, administrators and policymakers are already involved in open education initiatives. We now have the opportunity to grow this movement to include millions of educators and institutions from all corners of the earth, richer and poorer. We have the chance to reach out to policymakers, working together to seize the opportunities ahead. We have the opportunity to engage entrepreneurs and publishers who are developing innovative open business models. We have a chance to nurture a new generation of learners who engage with open educational materials, are empowered by their learning and share their new knowledge and insights with others. Most importantly, we have an opportunity to dramatically improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people around the world through freely available, high-quality, locally relevant educational and learning opportunities.

We, the undersigned, invite all individuals and institutions to join us in signing the Cape Town Open Education Declaration, and, in doing so, to commit to pursuing the three strategies listed above. We also encourage those who sign to pursue additional strategies in open educational technology, open sharing of teaching practices and other approaches that promote the broader cause of open education. With each person or institution who makes this commitment -- and with each effort to further articulate our vision -- we move closer to a world of open, flexible and effective education for all.",<em>The Cape Town Open Education Declaration</em>,,,,2014-09-01T16:14:13+00:00,6,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/6,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=128,128,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T13:56:05+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Digital Humanities, Open Source",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/128

His ""deliciously subversive new book,"" ""The Cult of the Amateur"" ""exposes the grave consequences of today’s new participatory Web 2.0 and reveals how it threatens our values..."" There is a parallel to Jaron Lanier's ""Digital Maoism: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism."" (Thanks to Bernardo Parrella for the link.)

THE ANTI WEB 2.0 MANIFESTO (Adorno-for-idiots) by Andrew Keen

1. The cult of the amateur is digital utopianism’s most seductive delusion. This cult promises that the latest media technology -- in the form of blogs, wikis and podcasts --  will
enable everyone to become widely read writers, journalists, movie directors and music artists. It suggests, mistakenly, that everyone has something interesting to say.

2. The digital utopian much heralded “democratization” of media will have a destructive impact upon culture, particularly upon criticism. “Good taste” is, as Adorno never tired
of telling us, undemocratic. Taste must reside with an elite (“truth makers”) of historically progressive cultural critics able to determine, on behalf of the public, the value of a
work-of-art. The digital utopia seeks to flatten this elite into an ochlocracy. The danger, therefore, is that the future will be tasteless.

3. To imagine the dystopian future, we need to reread Adorno, as well as Kafka and Borges (the Web 2.0 dystopia can be mapped to that triangular space between Frankfurt,
Prague and Buenos Aires). Unchecked technology threatens to undermine reality and turn media into a rival version of life, a 21st century version of “The Castle” or “The Library
of Babel”. This might make a fantastic movie or short piece of fiction. But real life, like art, shouldn’t be fantasy; it shouldn’t be fiction.

4. A particularly unfashionable thought: big media is not bad media. The big media engine of the Hollywood studios, the major record labels and publishing houses has
discovered and branded great 20th century popular artists of such as Alfred Hitchcock, Bono and W.G. Sebald (the “Vertigo” three). It is most unlikely that citizen media will
have the marketing skills to discover and brand creative artists of equivalent prodigy.

5. Let’s think differently about George Orwell. Apple’s iconic 1984 Super Bowl commercial is true: 1984 will not be like Nineteen Eighty-Four the message went. Yes, the “truth”
about the digital future will be the absence of the Orwellian Big Brother and the Ministry of Truth. Orwell’s dystopia is the dictatorship of the State; the Web 2.0 dystopia is the
dictatorship of the author. In the digital future, everyone will think they are Orwell (the movie might be called: Being George Orwell).

6. Digital utopian economists Chris Anderson have invented a theoretically flattened market that they have christened the “Long Tail”. It is a Hayekian cottage market of small
media producers industriously trading with one another. But Anderson’s “Long Tail” is really a long tale. The real economic future is something akin to Google -- a vertiginous
media world in which content and advertising become so indistinguishable that they become one and the same (more grist to that Frankfurt-Prague-BuenosAires triangle).

7. As always, today’s pornography reveals tomorrow’s media. The future of general media content, the place culture is going, is Voyeurweb.com: the convergence of
self-authored shamelessness, narcissism and vulgarity -- a self-argument in favor of censorship. As Adorno liked to remind us, we have a responsibility to protect people from
their worst impulses. If people aren’t able to censor their worst instincts, then they need to be censored by others wiser and more disciplined than themselves.

8. There is something of the philosophical assumptions of early Marx and Rousseau in the digital utopian movement, particularly in its holy trinity of online community,
individual creativity and common intellectual property ownership. Most of all, it’s in the marriage of abstract theory and absolute faith in the virtue of human nature that lends
the digital utopians their intellectual debt to intellectual Casanovas like young Marx and Rousseau.

9. How to resist digital utopianism? Orwell’s focus on language is the most effective antidote. The digital utopians needs to be fought word-for-word, phrase-by-phrase,
delusion-by-delusion.  As an opening gambit, let’s focus on the meaning of four key words in the digital utopian lexicon: a) author b) audience c) community d) elitism.

10. The cultural consequence of uncontrolled digital development will be social vertigo. Culture will be spinning and whirling and in continual flux. Everything will be in motion;
everything will be opinion. This social vertigo of ubiquitous opinion was recognized by Plato. That’s why he was of the opinion that opinionated artists should be banned from his
Republic.

When I say ‘we’, it means ‘many of us’ or ‘some of us’. When I say ‘we are’, it means ‘we often are’. I say ‘we’ only so as to be able to talk about us at all.

1. We grew up with the Internet and on the Internet. This is what makes us different; this is what makes the crucial, although surprising from your point of view, difference: we do not ‘surf’ and the internet to us is not a ‘place’ or ‘virtual space’. The Internet to us is not something external to reality but a part of it: an invisible yet constantly present layer intertwined with the physical environment. We do not use the Internet, we live on the Internet and along it. If we were to tell our bildnungsroman to you, the analog, we could say there was a natural Internet aspect to every single experience that has shaped us. We made friends and enemies online, we prepared cribs for tests online, we planned parties and studying sessions online, we fell in love and broke up online. The Web to us is not a technology which we had to learn and which we managed to get a grip of. The Web is a process, happening continuously and continuously transforming before our eyes; with us and through us. Technologies appear and then dissolve in the peripheries, websites are built, they bloom and then pass away, but the Web continues, because we are the Web; we, communicating with one another in a way that comes naturally to us, more intense and more efficient than ever before in the history of mankind.

Brought up on the Web we think differently. The ability to find information is to us something as basic, as the ability to find a railway station or a post office in an unknown city is to you. When we want to know something - the first symptoms of chickenpox, the reasons behind the sinking of ‘Estonia’, or whether the water bill is not suspiciously high - we take measures with the certainty of a driver in a SatNav-equipped car. We know that we are going to find the information we need in a lot of places, we know how to get to those places, we know how to assess their credibility. We have learned to accept that instead of one answer we find many different ones, and out of these we can abstract the most likely version, disregarding the ones which do not seem credible. We select, we filter, we remember, and we are ready to swap the learned information for a new, better one, when it comes along.

To us, the Web is a sort of shared external memory. We do not have to remember unnecessary details: dates, sums, formulas, clauses, street names, detailed definitions. It is enough for us to have an abstract, the essence that is needed to process the information and relate it to others. Should we need the details, we can look them up within seconds. Similarly, we do not have to be experts in everything, because we know where to find people who specialise in what we ourselves do not know, and whom we can trust. People who will share their expertise with us not for profit, but because of our shared belief that information exists in motion, that it wants to be free, that we all benefit from the exchange of information. Every day: studying, working, solving everyday issues, pursuing interests. We know how to compete and we like to do it, but our competition, our desire to be different, is built on knowledge, on the ability to interpret and process information, and not on monopolising it.","<em>We, the Web Kids</em>",,,,2014-09-01T16:21:13+00:00,4,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/4,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=130,130,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T13:55:06+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Anti-Capitalism, Open Source",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/130

Like journalism, for instance.

I'm not talking about grafting an old product onto a new medium, which is, with a few exceptions, what everyone's been trying to do. The Web is jammed with newspapers and magazines taking their paper-based content and repurposing it. (That's the buzzword, I believe, for the online equivalent of leftovers. Hang a few hundred words out there and gussy them up with Hypertext Helper and maybe people will eat it.)

Of course we won't eat it. What are we, stupid?

The Birth of Way New Journalism

By Joshua Quittner

Well, Big Media isn't stupid either. Why do you think It's here?
Nearly two-thirds of the cost of putting out a newspaper or magazine is the cost of printing it (paper, ink, printing presses) and distributing it (trucks, delivery folks, mail). Uncouple the content from the production and distribution costs, and you see the kind of cash we're dealing with here. Introduce the possibility that by the end of the decade, 100 million people will be on the Net. Now, give those people the technical ability to pay 3 cents for each and every story they read. If only 1 million people read, say, one Time story on O.J. Simpson, that's US$30,000. Pretty soon, you're talking about real money.

Right now writers need Big Media because Big Media owns the means of distribution. But as soon as a standard for exchanging trivial sums of money is adopted on the Net, it will turn the tables on that equation, and Big Media will need writers. It becomes cheap to be a mass-market publisher, right? So if the financial terms of the relationship are unsatisfying, writers can publish their own Web sites, presumably taking readers with them. The news gatherers/storytellers with marketable points of view can dictate the terms for publishing their spin on the world.

But the change I'm talking about has nothing to do with making money. Indeed, the change I'm talking about is much bigger than money. I'm talking about a sea change in journalism itself, in the way we do the work of reporting and presenting information. The change that's coming will be more significant than anything we've seen since the birth of New Journalism; it may be even more revolutionary than that. It has to be: Look at all the new tools we're getting.

Tom Wolfe's article, ""The Birth of 'The New Journalism'"" smashed the conventional notion of reportage. If you aspired to The Calling, you had to read this piece; it's taught in most journalism schools to this day. Wolfe pointed out that it was OK to have fun with facts (as long as the writer had mastered the material). It was good to speak with a voice (as long as the writer wasn't too much of a dork). It was important to take risks and experiment (as long as there was a tangible payoff for the reader).

But Wolfe and company had a relatively small tool chest to loot. Imagine what those new journalists could have done with video and sound, with hypertext links and limitless bandwidth. Yes, a journalism that uses the best devices of the novel - and the movie! and the radio! and the CD-ROM! and networked communications! - to tell stories.

We're not just going to change that art, but evolve it - you understand - take it to the next plane: The Way New Journalism.

So where are the Way New Journalists? They're out there hacking around, testing the tools, looking for ways to use this radical change in technology to improve storytelling. You can see it on the Web. Already, there are things that work, and things that don't. Most of these sites have nothing to do with journalism; but then again, neither did the novel.

A Few Things That Should Work in the Way New Journalism:
The element of surprise: I titter as Netscape paints 10 new images on my screen. It's like headlines in three dimensions: Something catches my eye and tricks me into looking for more. Something lures me into interacting and tunneling deeper for information. Point, click, and open a jack-in-the-box that tells you something you didn't already know.
Sudden narrative: Face it - until we have flexible flat panels with brilliant, high-definition displays, reading on the screen sucks. Sudden narrative to the rescue: Tell me a dramatic story in, say, 250 words - a screenful of text. This is an important device, too, because brevity will be an antidote to the Net's information overload.

Voice: Voice becomes more intimate and immediate online. You expect your reporter (or your newspaper/magazine) to be an intelligent agent, a voice you recognize and trust. Since, theoretically at least, our email addresses will be part of our bylines, you'll be able to flame away at the reporter. This means the piece of reportage will exist in an organic state, with an evolving factual base. Small errors will be unacceptable because they can be so easily corrected. You'll also ""know"" your reporter better.

Hypertext links: surfing around for three hours, only to end up dazed and confused and disintermediated at a White House press-briefing site.

Instant reaction/The Big Talk Show in the Sky: No more of that Man on the Street crap. You can build reaction right into a story by linking to the appropriate Usenet forum, IRC channel, or MOO. You can talk about this story by joining the thread already in progress - or start your own. Don't underestimate this device. I learn best by reading, but talking about information with someone else is an equally efficient way to absorb data.

I suspect that the people who figure out how best to use the tools of the Net for journalism will be the people with nothing to lose. Which is to say, kids, students, the disenfranchised. The Wolfes and the Breslins are out there. They have a medium but no platform ... yet.

I teach a class at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. We use the Internet to find news stories. Soon, we'll be publishing our stuff on a Web site. I told the students that we're starting from scratch; we have no content to repurpose. We just have a Web site, our own computer geek who can tweak HTML like it's his native tongue, and empty space that extends infinitely. How do we fill it? What works? Will anything work?

""Do we have to use the page as a metaphor? Can a page be an oval or a circle instead of a rectangle?"" one student asked.

   (""It's normal!"").
· Deprivatize corporate content, liberate the virtual enclosures and storm 
  the content castles!
· Refuse the institutionalization of net processes.
· We reject pornography on the net unless well made. 
· We are still, until this day, rejecting make-work schemes and libertarian 
  declarations of independence.
· NGOs are the future oppressive post-governments of the world. 
· We support experimental data transfer technology.
· Participate in the Nettime retirement plan, zero work by age 40. 
· The critique of the image is the defense of the imagination.
· Nettime could be Dreamtime.

On technology, its always already there in *the* Manifesto:

Seems to me that its worth remembering some interesting correspondences:

The Manifesto - (1847 version, refuse all imitations) - is proliferating
on this auspicious anniversary. May there be 100, 1000 10,000
manifestos, but let us remember the point is not to manifest, but to
change the world.

So, one hundred and fifty years ago in France Marx published 'The
Poverty of Philosophy', and although this work has always been eclipsed
by another text written that same year, it is worth consulting and is as
much deserving of reprint as the Manifesto (which has been released
again by at least six different publishers - both texts can be readily
accessed via the world wide web).

[I note with some amusement another correspondence: that the typewriter
was invented in the same year as that other great piece of 19th century
technology 'Das Kapital' - 1867. (Gayatri Spivak made a similar point
about the ticker tape machine)].

Marx and Engels did write in the COM.MANIFEST about the bourgeoisie
rapidly expanding the means of communication...

'The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all the instruments of
production, by the *immensely facilitated means of communications*,
draws all, even the most barbarian nations into civilization. The cheap
prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters
down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians' intensely
obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate. It compels all nations, on
pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it
compels them to introduce what it calls civilization into their midst,
i.e., to become bourgeois themselves. In a word, it creates a world
after its own image' (Marx and Engels 1847/1952: 47)

Interestingly, the 'immensely facilitated' means of communications of
the English translation might also be rendered with a stronger
affirmation when translated as 'infinite release' - the 'unendlich
erleichterten' (Marx and Engels 1847/1970: 47) suggests also the release
of a never-ending opening of communications that already anticipates the
continually developing communications environment characteristic of the
information order today.

First Analysis of the temporary WorkSpaces
By Pit Schultz and Geert Lovink

For the Hybrid WorkSpace presentation
100 days program, Documenta X, Kassel
'50 days, 120 guests', August 14, 1997

*how to write a manifesto* -- a document type description

Classical modernism brought us a new textual format for the multipurpose use in the alien environment of technical media. The manifesto was introduced by several avantgardist artist groups at the beginning of this century as a document type to mediate an emphatic moment of urgency, the utopia of the radical new.

Today, the manifesto returns as a useful form of electronic discourse that locates itself into the heart of cybernetic power. It does not just articulate a hierarchical voice from above, representing the wishes of others. It does not just promote the project of one predominant world model, it even cannot be taken seriously in every detailed claim it may make. In the main, the digital manifesto is a highly efficient form of
communication which provides a frame of immediacy and presence for those formulating it. 

The digital manifesto no longer makes the distinction between endless interpretations and the decisive logic of punctual statements, it articulates a profound, and often artificial subjectivity without reclaiming absolute power in the real world. It creates an ambigious mode between visibility and virtuality which makes it useless to serious forms of executing power by virtue of its very absence. Paradoxically, only
through the fact of its powerlessness and marginality the digital manifesto can claim to speak in the name of superhuman forces. 

The digital manifesto, as found in countless instances on the electronic networks, is not rewriting the human command-line-interface as it is known from before the War. In the times of the Nets, after deconstruction is over, the manifesto is a node which attracts other texts, including audio and video, and plays with the viral potential of being able to get
forwarded, redistributed, quoted and translated. 

The digital manifesto functions as a media genre which speculates with maximum attention and possible media exposure. It mimics the gesture of broadcasting in the times of democratised xerox publicity. By definition the digital manifesto has a strong message. It claims an imaginative
totality, a possible future, a virtual territory, knowing that it exists amongst a multiplicity of other manifestoes, which all put into concrete practice the passion for polemics and rethorics of public imagination:  ""I had a dream"" (in Martin luther King's famous opening words). You may find
the digital manifesto all over the net refering to its outside, and refering to each other just by the fact that they express a will to be heard, to be heard about an extreme form to see the world.

The digital manifesto is the opposite of the self-referential
contemplation from within the system. It breaks through the chains of endless interpretation of existing textuals material. It is stating the obvious, claiming the impossible, and deserving the full field of pragmatic possiblities to the limit where they become truly speculative. Next to the document types such as the pamphlet, the declaration, the statement, the sermmon, the agenda, the charter or the petition, and in
distinction to the essay, the article, the report, or other lengthy textes, the digital manifesto performs a compression which deals with the need for shortening, cutting and selecting from the media streams. From the very beginning it anticipates broadcasting and what it can do to a text. ""Keep
it short, my attention span is limited."" (J. Sjerpstra) The typical form of the digital manifesto is a long list of paragraphs, which functions like as a crystal, where one paragraph can reflect all others. The potential character of this text type is not hidden or embedded in a set of characters and narrations like in a novel, or allegory. In a digital manifesto the need
for far more possibilities meets the desire to touch the level of the real and serves a popular info-vehicle in the struggle for attention.

Nowadays, if you are working in the field of the new media, you are very squarely confronted with the institutional power of the image. The multimedia are out there, but apparently some media are more equal then others... Those which work with an interface of visual representation are also those which are the most appealing to consumers, advisors, media theorists, and museum curators. Optical media have traditionally a predominant role in the process of constructing the truth and representing the invisible. When it comes to reflexion about reality, our Western language is full of terms which privileges the visual above all other senses when
speaking about the truth. The direct way of exersizing power over people's dreams and visions is by controling the sphere of images. This plays a crucial role not only in religion and advertisement but all fields which need the services of representation of power through visualisation as a form
of celebrating and mediating its legitimacy. In the new media industry which is specialized in the development of *interfaces* most of the work goes into the production of demos (see Peter Lunenfeld in nettime). Finally it needs
a surface to cover the emptiness of the final products with a shiny glamourous aura.

The aim being to produce media products that succesfuly suggest content, context, and communication. To produce a psycho-physical stimulus through visual information is a skill that has been learned from the various avant-gardes by putting their experiments into the commercial context -
without taking the social, political and idealistic world models of modernism, of course. This format speculates with the investments made by the users, like their craze on the stock market, the investments into an 'economy of ideas', and the simulated empty products snatching away the peoples' attention/money without satifying their desires. As long as a
product is in demo mode it produces wishes by reiterating the promise of the tremendous potentials of the full version always to come. 

The problems of media design have not yet been properly discussed. Some tend to see this 'artisan' practice more in its classical terms, where design is the final phase of the production process. In the information business, however, design plays the role of architecture, since it structures activities and organises knowledge and memory. Navigational
design determines the modes of orientation and in the best case predics all possible moves and interpretations by the users. The best interface is the one which becomes invisible. Electronic images are bringing you to the other sphere behind the screen, they are stimulating the imagination, they are trying to mediate between programmers and users, they are pretending to give technology a human face and are helping to reorganise business and workflows. Electronic images are fulfilling an initiative role in the first encounter with the realm of new media, they are mediating today the sphere of [to-morrow's] dream time, the mythological nomos, the realm
of the uncouncious. 

The aesthetics of total dispersion of the televised image do not break through the screen of the representational paradigm. The celebration of optical media exchanging the role of painting does not say much about the average media users which even probably wish they could see real paintings
again. It is the the play with the modes of visibility and invisibility, the aggregates of mediation between possible modes of representation expanded from the flat tableaux of the computer screen, to different frames of code and transformation, which can easily circumvent central authorities of quality control just by finding new combinations, or creating new hybrids and different intensities. On the carrier of digital media, such very private mixes introduce for a while the pure joy of doing 
it yourself. Before the old institutions or commercial enterprises move in, other fields for tactical use are already there. 


*hybrid*

Hybridity has many names, many faces. One of these is the merger we are witnessing between video-technology and the Internet. But the much-vaunted wedding of TV and Web may well never happen. The cult of the interface culminates in its current brief to unifify all media under one big browser. The most recent manifestation of this idea is the 'setup box', the 'network computer' and the attempt to reinvent Television on the Internet in the so called 'Push Media'. During the phase of the war of standards we see a diversity of interrim media, a variety of sub-standards, incompatibilities and central giant media which try to include and swallow up small media.

On the technical level hybrid systems are very often the pragmatic way of resistance, and an attempt at finding the best possible solution aside from the one which consist of dominating the market by including different or older systems. This quite resembles the status quo prevailing in pop
culture, where hybridity as cultural policy works against 'apartheid' and the sweet promises of a totality which is hidden behind the concept of the 'Gesamtkunstwerk'. Hybridity as postmodern condition is not a strategy but
a starting point [ - or a benchmark]. There is a certain threshold where the dirtyfication, mixing and opening of systems gets rejected. The double face of hybridisation needs both a critique in the context of the expansion of global capital and an analysis of its possiblities of emancipation at the micro-level. On the dangerous road which leads to
becoming a Media-Gesamtkunstwerk the concept of hybridity looses contact to subjects and serves as a model of sophisticated organisation and domination.


*work*

""Networking is notworking."" (George Soros) Beyond the ideal of full employment and the scenario of a jobless economy there are many practical examples of inventing new forms of work. Whether this takes the form of a neo-liberal part-time McJob or some activity within state-run dole-for-work programmes, or some kind of occupation within the fast-expanding black money economy, or a slave job in a sweat shop in the ""Little Asias"" sprouting all over the place, or just a new, formalised way of neighborhood help, the traditional concept of work is changing rapidly. And very often it does so by applying information technology.

Also, at the same time, a certain type of ""autonomous work"" seems to perstist. It drudges on at the limit of complete exhaustion, working with the bare achievement of the existential minimum as reward, within settings endowed with low resources and next-to-no budget. It must be the lure of
some different gratification than money which motivates some people to work so hard in the non-profit-media. And yet this could become the model for many more people. Work is still the golden road to self-realisation.

To detach it from the curcuits of capital begs the question on which economy it should rely. It is all too easy to state that through the rise of neoliberalism many sectors of the public sphere are being privatised as well as other resources are getting exploited in an irreversible way, which also means that there are no ways in turning back the clocks. While
everybody seems to reluctantly agree on the fact that not much money has been made on the net to date, one keeps betting on a big boom triggered by the global information networks. 

The main issues at stake here are the emergence of new types of jobs in the service sector and a need for more and lifelong education. Yet, in the same breath, one oversees the existence of a shadow economy of gifts, a do-it-yourself culture of producing public content without prospect of making the big buck. Apart from the small community of net experts which
earn their keep with advisory or journalistic work, or the even smaller band which finds their little niches in the art world, the vast majority of small content producers are private individuals which like to publish what they like for the sake of it. This process of democratisation of the means of production, as sore and basic as it is, realises a big dream of
many social utopians. The only drawback being that the glory and class consciousness of the new virtual working class does not seem to come very much into existence.  While we have all possible tools for more media freedom still in front of us we are often unable to do anything, hypnotized as we are by the pronouncements about the rise of total marketization. Avoiding self-exploitaion and burn-out on the one hand,
sell-out and alienation on the other, the exploration of the possible modes of finding work in the new media is a challenging task indeed. While the trap of an ascethic ideal as well as the tragedy of a realised utopia makes you hyper-sensitive against false promises, you still have to work it out.


*space*

Different kind of spaces deserve different kinds of action. The media space is defined by its participants: there's no content without social context. And there is no way of defining a media space either without someone accessing it. The problem with spacial metaphors is that they do not normally include any time model. A combination of a time model with a
social model, with a definition of the modes of access to a set of media equipment can already be enough to build a model of a small cyberspace. (You can do that at home, like the radio-amateurs in the 20ies did.) It could describe the ways a network can dynamically change, the multipliticity of layers of accessablity, and the diversive ways how to represent a set of datas. It could emphasize the importance of relying on
mutually agreed-upon standards, not only in the definition of interfaces between the machines or parts of programs, the software and the hardware, or different pieces of hardware. These same standards also occur on the level of social associations, in form or jargons, marks for orientation,
certain conventions of naming and adressing the yet unknown. In this way a cultural space could evolve, which is completly constructed by the definitions and interdependencies of the actors which create it through
their actions and decisions. Cyberspace, besides its geographical extension, is a pure social construction. It has as many dimensions as there are nodes within it [male or female?] it is more a vectorial space, or an imaginary one describable by fairly abstract mathematical models
far beyond any three dimensional metaphors. 

To bind a cyberspacial social environment to a physical space therefore may well render the need for a metaphorical architecture obsolete. Through social contacts (and the attention they bring with it) a more fuzzy process of forming a hybrid space which combines the real and the virtual becomes productive. But the connection between the real and the virtual realm will not go smoothly. It is a never ending story of disruptions, bugs in the human-to-human communication, conflicting standards and cultural glitches. The virtual should not become a quasi parallel world, nor should we return to the tactile solidity of the 'real' cities, the so-called nature or the social that might have existed once. The temporary
workspaces and gatherings we are organizing do not intend to produce a concensus. No constructive solutions here. Our aim should be the design of problems and conflicts, free content, not the synergy of all technical media.

It’s hard out here for futurists under 30.

As we percolated through our respective nations’ education systems, we were exposed to WorldChanging and TED talks, to artfully-designed green consumerism and sustainable development NGOs. Yet we also grew up with doomsday predictions slated to hit before our expected retirement ages, with the slow but inexorable militarization of metropolitan police departments, with the failure of the existing political order to deal with the existential-but-not-yet-urgent threat of climate change. Many of us feel it’s unethical to bring children into a world like ours. We have grown up under a shadow, and if we sometimes resemble fungus it should be taken as a credit to our adaptability.

We’re solarpunks because the only other options are denial or despair.

The promises offered by most Singulatarians and Transhumanists are individualist and unsustainable: How many of them are scoped for a world where energy is not cheap and plentiful, to say nothing of rare earth elements?

Solarpunk is about finding ways to make life more wonderful for us right now, and more importantly for the generations that follow us – i.e., extending human life at the species level, rather than individually. Our future must involve repurposing and creating new things from what we already have (instead of 20th century “destroy it all and build something completely different” modernism). Our futurism is not nihilistic like cyberpunk and it avoids steampunk’s potentially quasi-reactionary tendencies: it is about ingenuity, generativity, independence, and community.

And yes, there’s a -punk there, and not just because it’s become a trendy suffix. There’s an oppositional quality to solarpunk, but it’s an opposition that begins with infrastructure as a form of resistance. We’re already seeing it in the struggles of public utilities to deal with the explosion in rooftop solar. “Dealing with infrastructure is a protection against being robbed of one’s self-determination,” said Chokwe Lumumba, the late mayor of Jackson, MS, and he was right. Certainly there are good reasons to have a grid, and we don’t want it to rot away, but one of the healthy things about local resilience is that it puts you in a much better bargaining position against the people who might want to shut you off (We’re looking at you, Detroit).

Solarpunk punkSolarpunk draws on the ideal of Jefferson’s yeoman farmer, Ghandi’s ideal of swadeshi and subsequent Salt March, and countless other traditions of innovative dissent. (FWIW, both Ghandi and Jefferson were inventors.)

The visual aesthetics of Solarpunk are open and evolving. As it stands, it’s a mash-up of the following:

1800s age-of-sail/frontier living (but with more bicycles)
Creative reuse of existing infrastructure (sometimes post-apocalyptic, sometimes present-weird)
Jugaad-style innovation from the developing world
High-tech backends with simple, elegant outputs
Obviously, the further you get into the future, the more ambitious you can get. In the long-term, solarpunk takes the images we’ve been fed by bright-green blogs and draws them out further, longer, and deeper. Imagine permaculturists thinking in cathedral time. Consider terraced irrigation systems that also act as fluidic computers. Contemplate the life of a Department of Reclamation officer managing a sparsely populated American southwest given over to solar collection and pump storage. Imagine “smart cities” being junked in favor of smart citizenry.

Tumblr lit up within the last week from this post envisioning a form of solar punk with an art nouveau Edwardian-garden aesthetic, which is gorgeous and reminds me of Miyazaki. There’s something lovely in the way it reacts against the mainstream visions of overly smooth, clean, white modernist iPod futures. Solarpunk is a future with a human face and dirt behind its ears.",<em>Solarpunk: Towards a Manifesto</em>,,,,2014-09-07T15:37:40+00:00,14,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/14,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=137,137,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T13:53:01+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,Solar Punk,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/137

Wolfgang Pietsch

This is a plea for democratic supervision and regulation of the large data sets that are currently being collected all over the digital world — a plea driven not by fears for the privacy of the individual but by worries that a privileged knowledge of the mechanics governing the social world could allow for a one- sided and largely unrecognized control of the masses.

In the nineteenth century, in an age of unprecedented and seemingly limitless technological and scientific progress, scientists had a dream — a vision of a social science as systematic and powerful as the most developed of the natural sciences, a science of man modeled after physics. Like celestial mechanics, such a social science could be reduced to a few principles from which, under sufficient knowledge of the boundary conditions, everything else becomes derivable. It would allow for the prediction of the future course of the major actors in society just as celestial mechanics allows for the determination of the trajectory of Venus or Mars. The dream was never realized.

With obvious frustration, methodologists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, great and penetrating minds like the philosopher and economist John Stuart Mill, blamed this failure on the complexity of the social world and the fact that social phenomena do not fit neatly into a laboratory and are thus exempt from systematic experimentation. The social scientist cannot just exchange a democracy for a dictatorship, run history again, and record the effects of the change. Observing the fate of man in society rarely leads to causal knowledge allowing for prediction and control over social phenomena. Data collected in the social world can only disclose correlations — of which no one can be sure if and where they will hold again — not causal knowledge geared toward prediction and control. Or so it seemed.

Then came the digital age. In a world of big data and increasingly detailed recordings of the boundary conditions under which social phenomena happen, the known islands of causal knowledge are becoming larger, and the sea of ignorance retracts. Almost certainly, these islands will become continents in one not so distant day. This is not to claim that everything in the social sphere will become predictable, but prediction and control will be possible in ever more areas. After all, we are not dealing with a problem of principle; it is just a matter of quantity of data and of processing power. Complex phenomena require extensive experimentation; incredibly complex problems require incredibly large data sets. For a scientist in the nineteenth century, it was impossible to imagine how mankind could ever process or even possess such data sets. But it is no longer so.

     THE LINUX MANIFESTO

| part 1 | part 2 | part 3 |

     ------------------

""Some people think giving away the operating system for free is somehow tied to communism. These people think that Microsoft is a good company, because 'It must be good if the richest man on Earth owns it.'""

boot: Let's discuss Linux's conception.  How did it originate?

Torvalds: It really came to be because of my own personal needs. I was a student and a very poor computer person. I knew I couldn't live with DOS and Windows. I wanted to run somebody else's operating system and be happy and not worry. But nobody else's operating system fit my needs. You either had the really low-end, DOS, or you had the really high-end--the real operating systems, such as Unix, which 
nobody used as personal operating systems.  They were used in commercial settings in universities, in research institutions--big places. And big places don't care if they throw $10,000 out the window because that's peanuts to them. But to a poor student like me, it wasn't peanuts.

So I got a teaching operating system, a small Unix-like thing that was meant to be a teaching aide of how operating systems worked. But it wasn't enough.

When I was 21, I was very self-assured when it came to programming and not very self-assured when it came to anything else. But I knew I was the best programmer in the world. So I just decided ""Hey, why couldn't I do this myself?"" And so I did.

boot: What were your needs at the time?

Torvalds: DOS didn't fit that bill, and Windows still doesn't. When I do something I expect the computer to do what I tell it to do because that's how computers are supposed to work. But if you're running Windows, MacOS, or a lot of other nonsecure operating systems, you really can't depend on the machine because there are too many bugs that can bring down the system.

And when there's too many things you can't depend on, you sit there nervously hoping it won't crash. I really hate not being able to trust the system.

boot: And Linux is something you can trust?

Torvalds: Ultimately, yes.  But when I'm doing very active 
development-such as adding new features--I'm doing stuff that really makes my personal system untrustworthy. I know I'm not immune to bugs either; but at the same time when something goes wrong, I can at least trust that I can fix it.

boot: Linux is based on Unix, right?

Torvalds: Well it's based on Unix in the sense that I was used to Unix and really liked it. Unix has a philosophy, it has 25 years of history behind it, and most importantly, it has a clean core. It strives for something, some kind of beauty. And that's really what struck me as a programmer. Operating systems that normal home users are used to, such as DOS and Windows, didn't have any way of life. Nobody tried to design Windows. It just grew in random directions without any kind of thought behind it.

boot: So what is it you hate about the Windows OS?

Torvalds: What's fundamentally wrong is that nobody ever had any taste when they did it. Microsoft has been very much into making the user interface look good, but internally it's just a complete mess. And even people who program for Microsoft and who have had years of experience just don't know how it works internally. Worse, nobody dares change it. Nobody dares to fix bugs because it's such a mess that fixing one bug might just break a hundred programs that depend on that bug. And Microsoft isn't interested in anyone fixing bugs-- 
they're interested in making money. They don't have anybody who takes pride in Windows 95 as an operating system.

People inside Microsoft know it's a bad operating system, and they still continue working on it because they want to get the next version out because they want to have new features to sell more copies.

The problem with this approach is that over time nobody understands it, nobody really fixes bugs other than when they're really obvious, and the end result is really messy. You can't trust it because under certain circumstances it just spontaneously reboots or just halts in the middle of something. Normally it works fine and then once in a blue moon for some completely unknown reason, it dies, and nobody knows why. Not Microsoft, not the experienced user, and certainly not the completely clueless user who probably sits there shivering, thinking ""What did I do wrong?""

That's what's really irritating to me.

boot: Don't you think programmers at Microsoft are proud of their OS?

Torvalds: I think there's a lot of programmers who aren't in it for the money primarily. They're probably programming because they really like programming and Microsoft pays them well. A lot of Microsoft programmers are really proud, but they aren't really proud of the OS itself. They're really proud of being part of something that's really successful.

I don't think Microsoft is evil in itself. I just think that they 
make really crappy operating systems.

boot: If they're so crappy, why don't people just say ""Let's just use Linux""?

Torvalds: A lot of Linux users are people who really need the 
stability and are ready to say, ""Goodbye Windows. I can't take this crap anymore."" But inertia keeps people with Windows because there's lots of good programs. Hardware manufacturers look at the market and say, ""Since most of the market is Windows 95, should we spend a lot of money developing for Linux or for Windows NT?"" Microsoft actually 
has problems getting drivers for NT. They've tried to make the 
interfaces between drivers to NT and 98 as similar as possible so that there would be less resistance, even though it has a fairly small percentage of the market.

Some of that inertia may actually end up helping Linux too. Microsoft can't change all of its internals quickly because it has so many applications. But if an emulation library is good enough so you can run all the applications you really need on other platforms, Microsoft will quickly lose the advantage.

People have tried this. Java is a good example of that. If the 
Windows application wasn't tied to Windows, but was a x86 bytecode, there's nothing stopping us from running Windows programs on Linux, Solaris, or anything else. Sun had WABI, a Windows emulation package, but it had some serious resource problems and was never good enough to become a big player.

boot: Can emulators actually work?  Will people start using Linux just to see if they do?

Torvalds: I don't see that happening very quickly. WINE (the Linux emulator for Windows) works to a fairly surprising degree. You can run real Windows programs with it, but some of them don't look right, and some of them just crash. But it has been making big progress in the last year, and now you can actually run Word for Windows. It doesn't work for everybody and there are known bugs, but it's almost  becoming usable. I doubt people will wake up and say, ""Hey, let's get rid of the shackles of Microsoft and switch to Linux and WINE."" But there are going to be more and more people who discover they really want the networking abilities of Linux, or who run a web server on it. WINE slowly expands the group of people who would find Linux or some other operating system acceptable because they really don't care 
about Microsoft per se; they care about a few programs.

In a few years WINE will be good enough that you can actually 
consider running Linux instead of Windows. It won't take over 100% of the market, but that's OK, too, because when you don't have one major entity that owns most of the market, it's a much saner, competitive environment. I think that'll happen, regardless of Linux.

boot: What happens if it doesn't happen?

Torvalds: We'll see some real stagnation in what you can do with computers. Software companies are already scared of making products that are too good because Microsoft either starts to look at them, or buys them up. That scenario happens fairly often. The bad situation, which is equally likely, is Microsoft decides it won't spend money on buying this company because it can compete in the same market space. 
And then just by being this behemoth, it just rolls over this smaller company.  It's kind of sad. This is supposed to be the land of opportunity, but many hardware and software companies are scared of Microsoft coming and taking their market away. Not by Microsoft being innovative, but by Microsoft just rolling over them. 

boot: Does 
Linux support multimedia better than Windows 95?  

Torvalds: Well, it depends on what you want to do. For games, there are a lot of developers who really have to jump through hoops to get anything done using DirectX.  There are actually game developers, such as id Software, who prefer working on Linux and developing all their software on it. When the game is ready, they port it to Windows because that's obviously the larger market.

For many multimedia applications you need A-1 reliability in timing. You care about the performance, but above all it should be smooth. You don't care about how many frames per second you can output; you care about the fact that you can output them at certain well-defined times. There's no point in trying to output 100 frames a second if all of them happen in the first half-second and the next half-second everything is still. And that's the kind of dependability that Microsoft has problems with.

Also, when it comes to the really interesting stuff, performance is a major issue.  A lot of multimedia is getting stuff off disk and onto the screen. In many cases Linux just performs a lot better. But there a lot of development tools under Microsoft that you don't have with Linux. There are multimedia environments for Linux too, but you don't have the same choices you have with Windows.

boot: There's a perception out there that Linux is difficult to 
install.

Torvalds: [interrupts] And it's completely wrong. But the perception comes from the fact that when you buy a PC, Windows is already installed for you. You don't actually see how nasty it is to install. Most people who want to use Linux are already used to Windows, and there's a small problem getting used to it.

So, yes, when you install Linux you have to do it yourself, but at least you don't have to reinstall it every time something goes wrong. But there are political issues too.

boot: Such as?

Torvalds: Some people think this open-source thing and giving away the operating system for free somehow is tied to communism. These people think that Microsoft is a good company, not because they're making good products, but because ""It must be good if the richest man on Earth owns it."" These are people who don't look at anything except commercial success. I've actually gotten e-mail (not often, but 
occasionally) from people who say ""Go home to Finland and don't take away these American jobs."" But these people completely ignore the fact that capitalism is based on being able to compete in the marketplace.

boot: If you were in charge of Microsoft's OS, what would be the first major change?

Torvalds: I don't know what there is to do anymore. They really can't change Windows 95 or 98. Too many programs depend on it. They can't muck around with the big kernels.

boot: Do you ever see a time where Microsoft might release an OS that doesn't have any legacy support for applications?

Torvalds: No. They certainly probably want to, but at the same time they definitely don't want to open themselves up to the competition.

boot: Do you have a Windows PC?

Torvalds: No. I really don't need to. When somebody sends me e-mail in Word 5, I just reply to them and say ""Please send this in readable format."" Even though I could start-up Word for Windows I choose not to. Of course, there aren't that many people who actually send me Word files. The people I e-mail with tend to know better!  [laughs]

boot: Compared to the BeOS and the MacOS, which seem to garner a lot of publicity, Linux is a silent OS. Why do you think that is?

Torvalds: It's marketing obviously. In number of shipped copies, Linux users number between 5 and 10 million, far beyond where BeOS is and about on par with MacOS. BeOS actually got most of its press by being the first Macintosh-centric OS.  So it wasn't actually competing against Microsoft, and as such it had a much easier time getting press because it was competing against this other niche market, right? I don't think they're going to make it because it's just too hard to commercially compete with Microsoft right now.

boot: Is Linux doomed to be a niche OS?

Torvalds: No, but I'm actually hoping that it won't take more than 25% or 30% of the market. If Linux owned 95% of the market it would be equally as sick. There is some need for competition.

boot: Are you happy with the current level of success?

Torvalds: Yes, it's just incredible. Considering that it was a young university student who started this seven years ago, and now Linux is being considered by some as the only alternative to Microsoft, how much more successful do I need to get?

boot: Can Linux survive without marketing?

Torvalds: With the Internet it can. Even though there is very little commercial marketing, there is a lot of noise about Linux on the Internet. You have a lot of Linux-specific and even nonspecific news groups out there. When it's a web newsgroup talking about web serving, probably the most popular platform for that is Linux.

Linux is more of a grassroots movement. It's not really planned; it just happens. And I think that Linux has enough features that it can make-do without marketing.

boot: You've got a full slate of global developers working on Linux. Why hasn't it devolved into chaos?

Torvalds: It's chaos that has some external constraints put on it. For example, the pure kernel has a copyright that says that whoever does Linux development doesn't need to go through me. If Microsoft--or anyone else--wanted to, they could take Linux tomorrow, start development on it, and do it completely on their own.  However, they're required to make all the changes available to everybody else. This ""no ownership"" idea means that the only entity that can really succeed in developing Linux is the entity that is trusted to do the 
right thing. And as it stands right now, I'm the only entity that has that degree of trust.

It allows chaos, but at the same time it has certain built-in things that just make it very stable. But you really need to be very good to take over development.  Knowing that the best person will be there to pick it up is exactly the kind of security feature you need in a development network.

boot: By nature of your current stature, some would accuse you of profiting from Linux's success. Have you done that and does this diminish Linux's overall ""free OS"" movement?

Torvalds: Profiting? I'm getting a lot of recognition and some of it is not necessarily deserved. I've done a lot of the really core functionality of the kernel, but there's been hundreds of other people who have written drivers for specific devices.  And to some degree they get less recognition than they really should in this area because I'm the only person who people really see as the figurehead of the development. Bill Gates gets all the glory for Microsoft even though he's got thousands of people working for him.

boot: Are you making any money on Linux at all?

Torvalds: No. Because I made Linux, I was able to make a name for myself, and I have a much better job than I would have otherwise. So that kind of indirect thing obviously exists. A few years ago people knew I was a poor student. At Christmas time I used to get a few personal checks of $100 or so. It didn't pay for development, but it was nice knowing that people care so much they're willing to pay even a small amount of money just because they want to.

boot: Is ""Linux"" a variation of your name?

Torvalds: Yes. Originally the official name was supposed to be Freix (pronounced ""freaks""). But it turns out that the person who had the FTP site in Finland didn't like the ""Freix"" (the ""ix"" is from Unix), so he decided on Linux instead.

boot: Is there a platform that Linux can't be ported to or used on?

Torvalds: I used to think you really wouldn't want to port Linux to anything without a good memory-management unit, and then a few crazy people actually ported Linux to the PalmPilot. And once somebody has done something like that, it has to be portable to just about anything.

boot: Is Linux still useful as a teaching aid?

Torvalds: Yes. When you're teaching about operating systems, you need to be able to show how things are done.  And with Linux this is trivial because you have sources and you have no obligations put on you from those sources. Microsoft has given source licenses for NT to big universities. But in giving those source licenses they tend to require certain things, such as requiring the students to sign nondisclosure agreements.  While that's OK for a certain class of school, it's not OK for a university that thinks it should allow people to also talk about what they have learned. So any serious university would not accept that kind of license.

I've actually been disgusted how many nonserious universities there are. There are universities that are considered to be reasonably good but teach people skills that must not be used in a professional capacity, except if they happen to be professionals at Microsoft. I find that to be fairly immoral for a school.

boot: You and Bill Gates walk into a dark alley. Who walks out?

Torvalds: [laughs] I have no idea. I think both.

boot: Why?

Torvalds: I don't think Bill Gates dislikes me personally.  I don't think he lies awake during the night. I think he's very aware of Linux, but I don't think he's worried, at least not yet. And for reasons I've already outlined, I'm not worried about Bill Gates because I don't care about the marketing side. Bill Gates is always mentioned to be this super programmer and is head of this big software firm, but he's really a marketing person. He used to know how to program, but I don't think he's programmed in a long time. Linus Torvalds and Bill Gates don't exist in the same sphere.

boot: Would you ever work for Microsoft?

Torvalds: Yes. I wouldn't say no to a job just because it's 
Microsoft, but it would have to be a real dream job, and right now I don't see Microsoft having that kind of dream job. But I don't have any religious belief that Microsoft is evil and that Bill Gates is Satan.

boot: What features do you have lined up for the next version?

Torvalds: The next version is not going to be a big step.  It's going to be mainly a performance release. It's more of a maturity thing. 2.2 will officially add the PowerPC and SPARC support, and improved SMP support. I expect it to be released sometime this summer.

boot: What about version 3?

Torvalds: We don't have any real plans. The obvious things we're looking into are clustering and more scalability. And we want to support certain things that WINE needs for Windows emulation. Version 2.2 will have more support for Window threading under WINE. Linux has had threading support for some time, but it still isn't window-specific.

boot: If you were sitting on a plane next to a CEO of a Fortune 50 company that wasn't using Linux, what would you say to persuade them to use it?

Torvalds: The sad thing is that a Fortune 50 company probably is using Linux, but the CEO won't know it. So they'll be using Linux in the engineering department or in support or something like this, but it won't be obvious enough that the CEO will be aware of that fact.

The one common way that Linux gets adopted inside organizations is by a small group of people who are working on a very specific project. They set up servers for their project and use Linux because it's usually the choice that needs the least paperwork. It isn't officially supported anywhere, but it's used in various places and then half a year later when another group has similar needs, they take notice. Sometimes companies decree ""this is unacceptable,"" but most usually unofficially bless it.

boot: Will there be a time when Linux won't be available for free?

Torvalds: No.

boot: You say that very quickly.

Torvalds: Yes. One of the reasons I say it quickly is I've been asked the question before, and I also have made certain there is no way anybody can take the freeness away. I very strongly feel that it's a good thing, and the copyright requires it.  And when somebody sends me big patches, I don't ask them to assign the copyright over to me. So right now, for example, the kernel itself has probably on the order of 50 or 100 copyright holders and the actual copyright license has always been the same. It's the GPL that requires that sources 
always be available. So in order to make a version of Linux that is not under that license, you have to get all those copyright holders to agree to the new license. The parts of the kernel that I own completely are significant, but they aren't enough to really make a good system. I did that consciously. I wanted to bind my own hands so that even if people don't trust me personally, they trust the fact that even if I wanted to turn commercial, I couldn't.

boot: What would Linux's tagline be?

Torvalds: Very early on I reached the conclusion that anything I ever get in e-mail is just hot air until I see some real code or some real fruit of the discussion. So we used one that we stole from Nike: ""Just Do It"". It says don't spout fire, just do it; and then after it's done, show the world.

boot: What's up with the penguin?

Torvalds: The penguin doesn't have any real meaning, but it relates to a trip I took to Australia four or five years ago when I was bitten by a fairy penguin.

boot: What the hell is a ""fairy penguin?""

Torvalds: Fairy penguins are these ferocious animals about ten inches high with a beak that couldn't kill a human or even a smaller animal. Unfortunately, one bit me when I attempted to pet it.  It was love at first sight.

A few years later when we were discussing what kind of logo people wanted, I decided on the penguin. Some people are still unhappy because they think that it's too noncommercial, but it's meant to be more fun than serious.  I'm much happier being associated with a fun and slightly irreverent logo than with something static and boring.

Raising the Standard
We are the founders of The League. As designers on the web, we have a calling to raise the standards of the web-design world. We’re not the only ones who value good design, and it’s time for the web world to catch up with it. We understand the challenges that comes with the internet, but with our discovery a few years ago of @font-face, we started getting excited. For those who aren’t up to speed, @font-face is a fairly new addition to web styling, letting a designer specify the location of their own font files. Instead of having to design with just a handful of web-friendly fonts, we’ll be able to use any typeface we desire. Well, that’s our vision, anyway.

The Open-Source Type Movement
There are people who design typefaces for a living, and we want them to make money off of something that they do well. This revolution is not a movement against type foundries and type designers; it’s quite the opposite. The kind of revolution we want is a change in the way people think about doing business. We want type foundries and typographers to start thinking,

“Maybe there’s nothing wrong with giving things away sometimes.”

It’s not always about the money, sometimes it’s also about making a contribution to society, and in this case, the design community. We want more people to look at it like that: like they have a responsibility to do something good for their peers. We’re not asking type designers and type foundries to sacrifice profit, we’re asking them to consider the benefits of contributing to a greater cause, to create a community where we not only have a high design standard for print and web alike, but also a community where we’re able to share our creations, knowledge, and expertise with our peers and the world.

Everyone's Welcome to Come
As a user, everyone is welcome to browse, download, and use our collection of hand-picked typefaces. In the spirit of sharing, all fonts made available by The League are subject to SIL’s Open Font License. It means that you’re allowed to use these fonts personally or commercially, as long as you credit the original creator, and if you made tweaks and changes to the typefaces, any new typefaces resulting from it should be licensed under the same terms. That way all our fonts and any new fonts resulting from them will always be open.

For a better understanding, we urge you to peruse our human-readable licenses, or read from the Open Font Library Wiki.

We Want the Best of the Best
As a contributor to our collection of high-quality typefaces, anyone who has a well designed typeface to share with the world is welcome to request membership. However, as founders of The League, we will use our best design judgement whether or not to add a typeface to our collection. Not because we don’t appreciate anyone who has something to share, but because we want to maintain the highest of standards.

Our Members
The League members are a group of very special people. It includes, us, the founders, as well as the all important Contributors, and those interested in participating and supporting the movement. These are the people who made it all possible, the reason why we have beautifully crafted, hand-made typefaces for everyone to enjoy, the people who help us fuel this revolution, and those who keep the open-source type movement alive.

by Eric Zimmerman

Games are ancient.

Like making music, telling stories, and creating images, playing games is part of what it means to be human. Games are perhaps the first designed interactive systems our species invented.

Digital technology has given games a new relevance.

The rise of computers has paralleled the resurgence of games in our culture. This is no accident. Games like Chess, Go, and Parcheesi are much like digital computers, machines for creating and storing numerical states. In this sense, computers didn’t create games; games created computers.

The 20th Century was the century of information.

Systems theory, communications theory, cybernetics, artificial intelligence, computer science – these fields, many of them emerging well before electronic computers, helped create the “information revolution.”

The abstraction of information has made possible massively complex bureaucracies and technologies, from telegraph and telephone networks to NASDAQ and Facebook. 

In our Ludic Century, information has been put at play. 

Our information networks no longer take the form of vast card catalogs or webs of pneumatic tubes. Digital networks are flexible and organic.

In the last few decades, information has taken a playful turn. To take a prime example, Wikipedia is not about users accessing a storehouse of expert knowledge. It is a messy, chaotic community in which the users are also the experts, who together create the information while also evolving the system as a whole.

In the 20th Century, the moving image was the dominant cultural form.

While music, architecture, the written word, and many other forms of expression flourished in the last century, the moving image came to dominate. Personal storytelling, news reporting, epic cultural narratives, political propaganda – all were expressed most powerfully through film and video. 

The rise of the moving image is tightly bound to the rise of information; film and video as media represent linear, non-interactive information that is accessed by a viewer. 

The Ludic Century is an era of games.

When information is put at play, game-like experiences replace linear media. Media and culture in the Ludic Century is increasingly systemic, modular, customizable, and participatory. Games embody all of these characteristics in a very direct sense.

Increasingly, the ways that people spend their leisure time and consume art, design, and entertainment will be games - or experiences very much like games.

We live in a world of systems.

The ways that we work and communicate, research and learn, socialize and romance, conduct our finances and communicate with our governments, are all intimately intertwined with complex systems of information – in a way that could not have existed a few decades ago.

For such a systemic society, games make a natural fit. While every poem or every song is certainly a system, games are dynamic systems in a much more literal sense. From Poker to Pac-Man to Warcraft, games are machines of inputs and outputs that are inhabited, manipulated, and explored.

There is a need to be playful.

It is not enough to merely be a systems-literate person; to understand systems in an analytic sense. We also must learn to be playful in them. A playful system is a human system, a social system rife with contradictions and with possibility.

Being playful is the engine of innovation and creativity: as we play, we think about thinking and we learn to act in new ways. As a cultural form, games have a particularly direct connection with play. 

We should think like designers.

In the Ludic Century, we cannot have a passive relationship to the systems that we inhabit. We must learn to be designers, to recognize how and why systems are constructed, and to try to make them better. 

It took several decades for automobiles to shift from being a hobbyist technology requiring expert knowledge to being a locked-in consumer product. The constant change of digital technology means that our hardware and software systems may never stabilize in this way. To fully engage with our world of systems, we must all think like designers. 

Games are a literacy. 

Systems, play, design: these are not just aspects of the Ludic Century, they are also elements of gaming literacy. Literacy is about creating and understanding meaning, which allows people to write (create) and read (understand).

New literacies, such as visual and technological literacy, have also been identified in recent decades. However, to be truly literate in the Ludic Century also requires gaming literacy. The rise of games in our culture is both cause and effect of gaming literacy in the Ludic Century. 


Gaming literacy can address our problems.

The problems the world faces today requires the kinds of thinking that gaming literacy engenders. How does the price of gas in California affect the politics of the Middle East affect the Amazon ecosystem? These problems force us to understand how the parts of a system fit together to create a complex whole with emergent effects. They require playful, innovative, trans-disciplinary thinking in which systems can be analyzed, redesigned, and transformed into something new. 

In the Ludic Century, everyone will be a game designer.

Games alter the very nature of cultural consumption. Music is played by musicians, but most people are not musicians – they listen to music that someone else has made. Games, on the other hand, require active participation.

Game design involves systems logic, social psychology, and culture hacking. To play a game deeply is to think more and more like a game designer – to tinker, retro-engineer, and modify a game in order to find new ways to play. As more people play more deeply in the Ludic Century, the lines will become increasingly blurred between game players and game designers.

Games are beautiful. They do not need to be justified.

This above all: games are not valuable because they can teach someone a skill or make the world a better place. Like other forms of cultural expression, games and play are important because they are beautiful. 

Appreciating the aesthetics of games – how dynamic interactive systems create beauty and meaning – is one of the delightful and daunting challenges we face in this dawning Ludic Century.

Very special thanks to the brilliant Heather Chaplin for developing these ideas with me over many conversations and arguments. And thanks to Nathalie Pozzi and John Sharp for insightful suggestions and editing.

Music technology has never been more exciting.  Every day brings new ways to be musical through new software, instruments, devices, platforms and protocols for fans, artists, and organizations.  People are experimenting with new ways to perform, collaborate and compose, to listen to their favorite artists and discover new ones, and to share the music they love.

Music technologies help us explore what it means to be human, to create, and to participate.  Music has always been technological.  Bone flutes and drums are among the oldest known technologies.  But music technologies are more than devices. They range from instruments and objects to toys, musical scales, notation, concert venues, software, books, policies, laws, copyright, platforms, habits and more.  They are ways of doing and being. They are both ordinary and extraordinary. Music gains life through an enormous range of practices and spaces.

Music technologies create possible futures and offer new ways to inhabit the present and past. Their changes presage changes in culture, signaling trends yet to come. They are thus sites of struggles over money, membership, power, and prestige.  Technological change is inseparable from economic, cultural and political change.

…But It Can Be More

Meaningful innovation is sustainable and just – yet the current landscape of music technology favors short-term profit-making, too often at the expense of deeper cultural concerns. Landfills swell with carelessly-designed consumer electronics, discs, cartridges, instruments, toys and gadgets. Like other cultural workers, many who contribute most to the richness of musical cultures lead increasingly precarious economic lives. But those who stand to profit the most economically have the biggest say in policy discussions. Too often music technologies are used as tools of exclusion rather than inclusion. Because what counts as “music,” “technology,” and “music technology” is unsettled, those with the most power create the most powerful definitions.

Meaningful innovation bridges multiple perspectives – yet the music technology field remains predominantly white, male, and tends toward assumptions that its user base is Western and able-bodied. Music is too often denigrated as frivolous or fetishized as sacred, shutting down discussion, action and investment in transformation. Technology, too, is fetishized, as if it did not come from and contribute to particular cultural worlds. It suffers from the glamour of the new, when it should be understood within its long history.

Meaningful innovation happens when fields intersect – yet those who work in music technology are too often siloed in distinct fields within universities, industry, startups, journalism, hobbyist and fan subcultures. We don’t always know how to think together, and we often do not know what others can contribute. We don’t even know what we don’t know. When fields do come together, old hierarchies too often overshadow the spirit of collaboration and mutual learning. Institutional barriers challenge our ability to work together, from the way organizations are structured to reward-systems that encourage people to keep doing what they have always done.

Let’s Build Better Worlds

Music technologies make worlds. Let us make better worlds. Let music technology do good, serve public interest, foster belonging, justice, collaboration and sharing, enable greater access to positive musical experiences and personal connections, and create durable objects and practices.

We call for greater awareness of the cultural forces already in new music technologies, and the courage to challenge or change them when the collective good demands it.

Ask of any music technology: For whom will this make things better? How? Is it open or closed to creativity and innovation it has not yet anticipated?

Ask of any policy: Whose rights and opportunities are being promoted?  Whose are being eroded? What idea of culture does it presume?

Ask of any practice: Who is invited to join in? Who is left out? Where will it find support?

Ask of any organization: How does it help people come together? Does it exploit them in doing so?

We must create more opportunities for people to engage one another through music. We must fight for people’s rights to create music and music technologies, and to enjoy music free of rent-seeking and unwarranted legal intimidation. We must stand up to abusive musical practices, from exploiting people’s dreams of making a living in music, to criminalizing whole classes of audiences and musicians, to subjecting people to hearing loss, to the use of music in coercion, warfare and torture.

Those concerned with music technology must develop a sense of ourselves as a “we” across different fields: creators, theorists, scholars, engineers, journalists, lawyers, activists, policy-makers, and others all together. We may not always agree, but we must have a sense of the whole and of our places within it.  We must acknowledge one another as equals so that we can collaborate on equal footing.

We call for cultural policies that foster music in its many forms and understand music technology as integral to culture.  We call for policies that support the arts through practices that go beyond markets. We call for a long-term perspective that privileges collective meaning and sustainability over profit. We call for everyone with a stake in music to have equally powerful voices in policy.

We call on scholars of music technology to ask big, important, difficult questions.  We call on their institutions to expand the range of practices that are considered legitimate modes of inquiry and to reduce barriers to collaboration.

We call for spaces that foster the highest levels of intellectual engagement through serious, sustained, challenging discussions and through play and creativity. We call for large and small venues where people work together across divisions—industrial, cultural, intellectual—in order to create more meaningful music technologies and to support others doing the same. We call for speakers, panels, conferences, and meetings to include people who may not seem to belong there.  We call on music technologists to explore venues where they may not think they fit.

We call on companies to produce music technologies that matter, that foster meaningful communities, that consider musical culture and user bases as much more than cash registers.

We call for technologies to be created with an eye for the long-term. Musical objects should last as long as the materials out of which they are made or they should be modular, recyclable, or transformable. They should be forward-compatible whenever possible.  Data must be portable and not bound to a particular company or platform.  At the same time, standards must not become coercive.  Music is not standard. We must cultivate the freedom to build and use nonstandard tools.

We are Music Technologists. We work in science, art, engineering, humanities, activism, social science, policy and industry. We believe in music technology and we want to build better worlds. We invite you to join us.

Balilla Pratella

I appeal to the young. Only they should listen, and only they can understand what I have to say. Some people are born old, slobbering spectres of the past, cryptograms swollen with poison. To them no words or ideas, but a single injunction: the end.

I appeal to the young, to those who are thirsty for the new, the actual, the lively. They follow me, faithful and fearless, along the roads of the future, gloriously preceded by my, by our, intrepid brothers, the Futurist poets and painters, beautiful with violence, daring with rebellion, and luminous with the animation of genius.

A year has passed since a jury composed of Pietro Mascagni, Giacomo Orefice, Guglielmo Mattioli, Rodolfo Ferrari and the critic Gian Battista Nappi announced that my musical Futurist work entitled La Sina d’Vargöun, based on a free verse poem, also by me, had won a prize of 10,000 lire against all other contenders. This prize was to cover the cost of performance of the work thus recognized as superior and worthy, according to the bequest of the Bolognese, Cincinnato Baruzzi.

The performance, which took place in December l909, in the Teatro Comunale in Bologna, brought with it success in the form of enthusiasm, base and stupid criticisms, generous defense on the part of friends and strangers, respect and imitation from my enemies.

After such a triumphal entry into Italian musical society and after establishing contact with the public, publishers and critics, I was able to judge with supreme serenity the intellectual mediocrity, commercial baseness and misoneism that reduce Italian music to a unique and almost unvarying form of vulgar melodrama, an absolute result of which is our inferiority when compared to the Futurist evolution of music in other countries.

In Germany, after the glorious and revolutionary era dominated by the sublime genius of Wagner, Richard Strauss almost elevated the baroque style of instrumentation into an essential form of art, and although he cannot hide the aridity, commercialism and banality of his spirit with harmonic affectations and skillful, complicated and ostentatious acoustics, he nevertheless does struggle to combat and overcome the past with innovatory talent.

In France, Claude Debussy, a profoundly subjective artist and more a literary man than a musician, swims in a diaphanous and calm lake of tenuous, delicate, clear blue and constantly transparent harmonies. He presents instrumental symbolism and a monotonous polyphony of harmonic sensations conveyed through a scale of whole tones—a new system, but a system nevertheless, and consequently a voluntary limitation. But even with these devices he is not always able to mask the scanty value of his one-sided themes and rhythms and his almost total lack of ideological development. This development consists, as far as he is concerned, in the primitive and infantile periodic repetition of a short and poor theme, or in rhythmic, monotonous and vague progressions. Having returned in his operatic formulae to the stale concepts of Florentine chamber music which gave birth to melodrama in the seventeenth century, he has still not yet succeeded in completely reforming the music drama of his country. Nevertheless, he more than any other fights the past valiantly and there are many points at which he overcomes it. Stronger than Debussy in ideas, but musically inferior, is G. Charpentier.

In England, Edward Elgar is cooperating with our efforts to destroy the past by pitting his will to amplify classical symphonic forms, seeking richer ways of thematic development and multiform variations on a single theme. Moreover, he directs his energy not merely to the exuberant variety of the instruments, but to the variety of their combinational effects, which is in keeping with our complex sensibility.

In Russia, Modeste Mussorgsky, renewed by the spirit of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, grafts the primitive national element on to the formulae inherited from others, and by seeking dramatic truth and harmonic liberty he abandons tradition and consigns it to oblivion. Alexander Glazunov is moving in the same direction, although still primitive and far from a pure and balanced concept of art.

In Finland and Sweden, also, innovatory tendencies are being nourished by means of national musical and poetical elements, and the works of Sibelius confirm this.

And in Italy?

The vegetating schools, conservatories and academies act as snares for youth and art alike. In these hot-beds of impotence, masters and professors, illustrious deficients, perpetuate traditionalism and combat any effort to widen the musical field.

The result is prudent repression and restriction of any free and daring tendency; constant mortification of impetuous intelligence; unconditioned propping-up of imitative and incestuous mediocrity; prostitution of the great glories of the music of the past, used as insidious arms of offense against budding talent; limitation of study to a useless form of acrobatics floundering in the perpetual last throes of a behindhand culture that is already dead.

The young musical talents stagnating in the conservatories have their eyes fixed on the fascinating mirage of opera under the protection of the big publishing houses. Most of them end up bad—and all the worse for lack of ideological and technical foundations. Very few get so far as to see their work staged, and most of these pay out money to secure venal and ephemeral successes, or polite toleration.

Pure symphony, the last refuge, harbors the failed opera composers, who justify themselves by preaching the death of the music drama as an absurd and anti-musical form. On the other hand they confirm the traditional claim that the Italians are not born equipped for the symphony, revealing themselves equally inept in this most noble and vital form of composition. The cause of their double failure is unique, and is not to be sought in the completely guiltless and incessantly slandered forms of opera and symphony, but in the writers’ own impotence.

They make use, in their ascent to fame, of that absurd swindle that is called well-made music, the falsification of all that is true and great, a worthless copy sold to a public that lets itself be cheated by its own free will.

But the rare fortunates who, through multiple renunciations, have managed to obtain the protection of the large publishers, to whom they are tied by illusory and humiliating noose-contracts, these represent the classes of serfs, cowards and those who voluntarily sell themselves.

The great publisher-merchants rule over everything; they impose commercial limitations on operatic forms, proclaiming which models are not to be excelled, unsurpassable: the base, rickety and vulgar operas of Giacomo Puccini and Umberto Giordano.

Publishers pay poets to waste their time and intelligence in concocting and seasoning—in accordance with the recipes of that grotesque pastry cook called Luigi Illica—that fetid cake that goes by the name of opera libretto.

Publishers discard any opera that surpasses mediocrity, since they have a monopoly to disseminate and exploit their wares and defend the field of action from any dreaded attempt at rebellion.

Publishers assume protection and power over public taste, and, with the complicity of the critics, they evoke as example or warning amidst the tears and general chaos, our alleged Italian monopoly of melody and of bel canto, and our never sufficiently praised opera, that heavy and suffocating crop of our nation.

Only Pietro Mascagni, the publishers’ favorite, has had the spirit and power to rebel against the traditions of art, against publishers and the deceived and spoilt public. His personal example, first and unique in Italy, has unmasked the infamy of publishing monopolies and the venality of the critics. He has hastened the hour of our liberation from commercial czarism and dilettantism in music; Pietro Mascagni has shown great talent in his real attempts at innovation in the harmonic and lyrical aspects of opera, even though he has not yet succeeded in freeing himself from traditional forms.

The shame and filth that I have denounced in general terms faithfully represent Italy’s past in its relationship with art and with the customs of today: industry of the dead, cult of cemeteries, parching of the vital sources.

Futurism, the rebellion of the life of intuition and feeling, quivering and impetuous spring, declares inexorable war on doctrines, individuals and works that repeat, prolong or exalt the past at the expense of the future. It proclaims the conquest of amoral liberty, of action, conscience and imagination. It proclaims that Art is disinterest, heroism and contempt for easy success.

I unfurl to the freedom of air and sun the red flag of Futurism, calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight, minds to conceive, and brows free of cowardice. And I shout with joy at feeling myself unfettered from all the chains of tradition, doubt, opportunism and vanity.

I, who repudiate the title of Maestro as a stigma of mediocrity and ignorance, hereby confirm my enthusiastic adhesion to Futurism, offering to the young, the bold and the reckless these my irrevocable conclusions:

To convince young composers to desert schools, conservatories and musical academies, and to consider free study as the only means of regeneration.

To combat the venal and ignorant critics with assiduous contempt, liberating the public from the pernicious effects of their writings. 

To found with this aim in view a musical review that will be independent and resolutely opposed to the criteria of conservatory professors and to those of the debased public.

To abstain from participating in any competition with the customary closed envelopes and related admission charges, denouncing all mystifications publicly, and unmasking the incompetence of juries, which are generally composed of fools and impotents.

To keep at a distance from commercial or academic circles, despising them, and preferring a modest life to bountiful earnings acquired by selling art.

The liberation of individual musical sensibility from all imitation or influence of the past, feeling and singing with the spirit open to the future, drawing inspiration and aesthetics from nature, through all the human and extra-human phenomena present in it. Exalting the man-symbol everlastingly renewed by the varied aspects of modern life and its infinity of intimate relationships with nature.

To destroy the prejudice for “well-made” music—rhetoric and impotence—to proclaim the unique concept of Futurist music, as absolutely different from music to date, and so to shape in Italy a Futurist musical taste, destroying doctrinaire, academic and soporific values, declaring the phrase “let us return to the old masters” to be hateful, stupid and vile.

To proclaim that the reign of the singer must end, and that the importance of the singer in relation to a work of art is the equivalent of the importance of an instrument in the orchestra.

To transform the title and value of the “operatic libretto” into the title and value of “dramatic or tragic poem for music”, substituting free verse for metric structure. Every opera writer must absolutely and necessarily be the author of his own poem.

To combat categorically all historical reconstructions and traditional stage sets and to declare the stupidity of the contempt felt for contemporary dress.

To combat the type of ballad written by Tosti and Costa, nauseating Neapolitan songs and sacred music which, having no longer any reason to exist, given the breakdown of faith, has become the exclusive monopoly of impotent conservatory directors and a few incomplete priests.

To provoke in the public an ever-growing hostility towards the exhumation of old works which prevents the appearance of innovators, to encourage the support and exaltation of everything in music that appears original and revolutionary, and to consider as an honor the insults and ironies of moribunds and opportunists.

And now the reactions of the traditionalists are poured on my head in all their fury. I laugh serenely and care not a jot; I have climbed beyond the past, and I loudly summon young musicians to the flag of Futurism which, launched by the poet Marinetti in Le Figaro in Paris, has in a short space of time conquered most of the intellectual centers of the world.",<em>Manifesto for Futurist Musicians</em>,,,,2014-09-14T18:01:43+00:00,12,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/12,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=148,148,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T12:24:15+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,Digital Music,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/148

I
Fundamentation

a) Music is and has always been a human activity, a manifestation of beings endowed with free choice, self-awareness, creative impulse, and the ability to judge and adopt criteria.
 
b) From its beginnings until today, electronic music has been primarily based on technology. From circuit behaviour, synthesis techniques or computation to manipulation of recordings or studio composition strategies, the majority of its past and current practices holds its basic technological configuration as being of primary value. The human (physical, mental, spiritual) aspects of performance have thus been regarded as being of secondary value, especially those which result from free decisions. The expression ""electronic music"" itself reveals these values.
 
c) Musical creation, being a human activity, should not be based on technology but, naturally, on the musician. Artistically relevant art forms tend not to have their own technology as subject. Music, regardless of its form (except generative), genre or creative process, is based on the musician's free decisions.
 
 
II
Designation

a) Electronic music is about one hundred years old, and has developed substantial maturity as an artistic practice. However, it has not reached cultural emancipation as a musical genre. Cultural emancipation is understood in this context as the appreciation of a genre by its formal, aesthetic and spiritual characteristics, regardless of the type of instrumental resources used.
 
b) The term ""electronic music"" refers to the type of technology used in its creation. It is a cultural anomaly for a musical genre to be defined by the instruments that are used in it (one does not use the term ""saxophone music,"" for instance), and this demonstrates its lack of cultural emancipation.
 
c) In its early decades, an innovative and revolutionary kind of artistic expression was generically named ""electronic music"". Today, however, the instrumental resources of electronic music are commonly used by multiple musical genres (techno, academic, glitch, ambient, experimental, noise, minimalism, etc.), yet all these are still indiscriminately known by the term ""electronic music"". It is no longer justified to apply the same designation to musical practices whose sole commonality is the use of the same electronic tools.
 
 
III
Conclusion

a) Music as a human achievement (physical, mental, spiritual) is a primary cultural value.
 
b) Music as a technological achievement is a secondary cultural value.
 
c) The term ""electronic music"", which encompasses musical expressions that have little in common, is no longer useful and is becoming void of meaning. Cultural emancipation of music creation using electronic means requires that the term ""electronic music"" is no longer used as a reference, referring instead to its actual or closest musical genre, or establishing a new one.

The History of the Music Industry vs The Future of Music
FMC staff Thursday, June 1, 2000

The history of the American Music Industry is a disheartening one, which largely details the exploitation of artists and musicians by opportunists and those without the musicians’ best interests at heart.

For too long musicians have had too little voice in the manufacture, distribution and promotion of their music on a national and international level and too little means to extract fair support and compensation for their work.

Manufacturing and distribution monopolies concentrate the power of over 90% of music sold into the hands of five labels. With huge media mergers continuing to consolidate the decisions of what to play and promote, it becomes more and more difficult for artists to gain exposure through the few remaining coveted radio spots.

Historically, musicians have had one of two unattractive choices:

Align themselves with major label exploiters and agree to unfair compensation in the hopes of one day reaching a national audience; or

Resign themselves to working with indies and a life in the shadows.

The Good News

Recent advances in digital music technology are loosening the stranglehold of major label, major media, and chain-store monopolies. Digital download and online streaming technology offers musicians a chance to distribute their music with minimal manufacturing and distribution costs, with immediate access to an international audience. Songs that would never be programmed through currently-existing narrow commercial channels are slipping through the radio industry programming stranglehold and gaining exposure, thanks to the new breed of file-sharing programs.

The Bad News

As these technologies advance, their very accessibility threatens many of the traditional revenue streams (like mechanical royalties) which compensate musicians, often without substituting new payment structures.

The Media and Policymakers

Most media attention to this issue polarizes discussion, focusing either on the exploitation of artists by the major labels or on the exploitation of the artists by Internet applications that encourage unauthorized copying. Artists are presented with a false and unnecessary choice, support traditional notions of artists’ rights and be called a money-grubbing luddite; or support new technology solutions and be accused of ignoring the plight of those artists left behind. This rhetoric pretends to speak for the artists, but in effect just continues to promote the viewpoints of moneyed interests like The Record Labels or The Technology Companies while it obscures some of the more promising new possibilities.

The Future of Music

We build this organization as an attempt both to address pressing music-technology issues and to serve as a voice for musicians in Washington, DC, where critical decisions are being made regarding musicians’ intellectual property rights without a word from the artists themselves.

No longer will corporate media and big money be able to frame the discussion of music solely in terms of their industries, as we draw together the strongest voices in the technology and independent music communities to address questions of music in the marketplace with a clear-eyed focus on the interests of the artists.

No longer will business interests or lobby groups for business interests drown out the voices of the musicians on whose art they have built an industry.

No longer will idealistic techies and idealistic musicians find themselves locked into opposing sides of an issue that profoundly affects both of our communities.

We begin this organization with the intention of addressing three pressing areas of concern.

Piracy / Technological Innovation

The Future of Music Organization is founded on the belief that creation is valuable and should be compensated. Here we are speaking of both musical creation and technological creation. By drawing together advocates for musicians’ rights and innovators in Internet technology, we will work to move the discussion away from the narrow privacy vs. piracy discussions that dominate the general media, toward practical solutions leveraging the strengths of digital download technology on behalf of the artists. Our work will encourage the development of innovative Internet music business models to guard the value of musicians’ labor and ensure that artists will continue to be paid for their compositions and performances despite drastic changes in methods of distribution.

The RIAA’s Conflict of Interest

The Recording Industry Association of America is a special interest group that claims from time to time to lobby on behalf of musicians, but it is funded by, and represents the interests of, the major record companies - the same corporations traditionally known to be the primary exploiters of the musicians that the RIAA claims to represent. The RIAA simply cannot be trusted to serve two distinct masters - the record companies and the artists. An important example is the “work for hire” issue: the RIAA pushed legislation that gives major labels the right to own musicians’ master tapes in perpetuity, changing an existing law that allowed some artists to regain the rights to their masters after 35 years. By advocating for this language, even while claiming to have the artists’ interests at heart, the RIAA made it clear that it is compromised, and cannot be left to its own devices in the policy-making arena.

In a more frightening development, the RIAA is attempting to step beyond its traditional lobbying role in order to enter the music-licensing business by collecting and distributing royalties from webcasts. While there is clearly a need for an organization to manage these royalties (webcasting royalties could result in more money than currently collected by BMI and ASCAP combined), the Future of Music has no confidence in the RIAA’s ability to represent the voice of musicians or to collect and distribute artists’ royalties from the major labels who fund the RIAA.

The Future of Music therefore advocates for an impartial and accountable organization to guard the value of artists’ webcasting royalties. By standing in opposition to the RIAA we hope to give voice to the concerns of musicians who are simply not represented by an organization whose core mission is promotion and protection of the record industry agenda.

 SDMI

The Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI), spearheaded by the RIAA, was an attempt to pull together a limited group of powerful consumer electronics manufacturers; PC manufacturers, and record labels to develop a copyright-enabled alternative to the MP3 format. It is viewed by many as a misguided and desperate scramble by those in the existing music business monopoly to maintain their stranglehold on the channels of distribution through the application of a standardized encryption or watermarking program.

As with most technologies that are conceived and developed in a no-feedback vacuum, without the desires of potential consumers in mind (not to mention an understanding of the limits of encryption technology), it was destined to fail. As much has been said by Executive Director Leonard Chiariglione, whose comments at the May 2000 SDMI meetings revealed a combination of infighting between competing business interests and fatal flaws in the group’s structure, which requires all decisions to be made by consensus. While SDMI members bicker and veto proposals based on the personal financial interests of their multi-national corporations, consumers are presented with narrow, confusing options that alienate them and thus do more to promote piracy, which becomes the only viable mode of digital transfer for the great majority of the world’s existing music.

The Future of Music believes SDMI is a perfect example of what happens when industry attempts to legislate technological advances without the crucial input of musicians and programmers.",<em>The Future of Music Manifesto</em>,,,,2014-09-14T18:06:10+00:00,12,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/12,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=150,150,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T12:14:56+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Piracy, Profit",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/150

I was asked to write a piece for Agit8.org.uk about ‘The Future Of The Music Industry‘. It was a nice chance to pull together a lot of thoughts, which, given that we’ve no idea quite how the future is going to pan out, are actually all about where we’re at now. A state of the indie nation address, if you will. So here it is. Enjoy, it’s a pretty good summary of where my thinking is at just now.

-o0o-
Major label collapse, 360 deals, Pirate Bay, Spotify, Bit Torrent, Youtube… It’s clear to anyone with half an eye on the news that something huge is happening in the world of music. And if you believe the majority of the press, it’s universally a bad thing – lots of very sad multi-millionaires are seeing their scarcity cash-cow sacrificed on the alter of ubiquity.

However, the problem is not actually with the music industry, but with the CD selling industry. There’s an old saying, ‘when all that you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail’ – if your entire view of what being ‘in music’ is about is shifting CDs, then indeed, the future of the CD selling business looks pretty bleak.

However, most of the statistics relating to this also seem to assume that the kind of spending that went on around the process of releasing CDs is an immutable fact of life.

The main problem for the majors is not just a breakdown of the barrier to ownership that CDs put between listeners and music, but that they used to own the marketing channels too – magazines, TV, radio – all required specialist access, which could be charged for. If you had a person in-house at the label who could do those things, then great, you could charge the band’s advance for the work, pay the flunky a pittance, and get paid twice by the band for the same job.

Likewise the recording process – studio time and expertise used to be hugely expensive. But the cost of recording equipment has plummeted, just as the quality of the same has soared. Sure, expertise is still chargeable, but it’s no longer a non-negotiable part of the deal:

A smart band with a fast computer can now realistically make a release quality album-length body of songs for less than a grand.

(though the question of what is ‘album length’ and why it has any meaning at all is now also up for discussion!)

So against the falling revenue from the sale of music, we need to map the drop in the cost of making, marketing and distributing music. The problem here is that the labels still have most of the infrastructure to do those things. Their business model relies as much on lubricating those wheels as it does putting the music out there. Simply put, it’s much harder to be experimental, personal and fluid in your thinking if your running costs are in the millions-per-year.

What does this actually mean? Well, it means that for me – and the hundreds of thousands of others like me – is that the process of making and releasing music has never been easier. The task of finding an audience, of seeding the discovery process, has never cost less or been more fun. It’s now possible for me to update my audience and friends (the cross-over between the two is happening on a daily basis thanks to social media tools) about what I’m doing – musically or otherwise – and to hear from them, to get involved in their lives, and for my music to be inspired by them.

I no longer need to pretend to be a rock-star.

The mythology of rock ‘n’ roll is nowhere near as interesting as the reality of creativity.

Whereas the reality of high-dollar touring, promotional duties, photoshoots etc. is phenomenally dull. That’s why the rock ‘n’ roll myths were created – to cover the tedium that is the day to day reality of most touring musicians. The number that ever made millions from it is so small as to not really be statistically relevant when discussing what’s best for ‘music’ – they just had an enormous media footprint.

So, if things are so great for the indies, does that mean loads of people are making loads of money? Not at all. But the false notion there is that any musicians were before! We haven’t moved from an age of riches in music to an age of poverty in music. We’ve moved from an age of massive debt and no creative control in music to an age of solvency and creative autonomy. It really is win/win.

The machine that was built around selling physical media containing music in the latter half of the 20th century is a statistical blip on a multi-millennia long human relationship with music as an art-form. The massive increase in spending on music, music making and music promotion didn’t bring with it a commensurate increase in quality. It did produce a lot of incredible music, most of which would have existed quite happily without the limos, 7-years-in-the-studio and the $2 Million video.

The creative knock-on effect of all these changes is that musicians are now thinking far more imaginatively about what it is that they want to do. The 80s dream of everyone becoming Stadium rock stars has faded, and more and more musicians are looking at fun ways to get to play music in a financially sustainable way.

House Concerts
Live streaming
listening parties
free downloads
live video chat
social media competitions and interactive promotion
all ways of musicians creating interest in and around the music they make, and none of them requiring much capital outlay or the involvement of ‘the machine’. Many artists can now make more money playing to 20 people in someone’s living room than they could trying to play rock clubs and bars, and even bands that do play bars are able to play twice as many shows by doing an acoustic house concert tour between the bigger club dates. Once again, win/win.

It looks like the way forward for music is going to be diverse, mobile, personal, niche, fun, cheap and shareable. I’m sure Live Nation will keep putting on stadium gigs for people who really want to see them – U2’s fanbase still has a decade or so before they’re too old to make it up the steps at Wembley – but the life of the average musician is no longer destined to be a series of debasements and indentures at the hands of record labels promising the earth but delivering precious little.",<em>Independent Music Manifesto</em>,,,,2014-09-14T18:08:03+00:00,12,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/12,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=151,151,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T12:14:45+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Independent Music, Piracy",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/151

Six aspects of the interface that are important to address to critically reflect contemporary digital culture 

We are living in an interface culture: wherever we are, we find touch screens, microphones, sensors, cameras; and we are constantly reminded of interfaces through their sounds. Whether mobile, networked or embedded in architecture or artefacts, the number of interfaces constantly increases to meet the desires of technologies, users and markets.

Usually, an interface is understood as a technological artefact optimized for seamless interaction and functionality. However, the interface also draws upon cultural and artistic traditions, and plays an important role in our culture as art, entertainment, communication, work and businesses. It is a cultural form with which we understand, act, sense and create our world. In other words, it does not only mediate between man and computer, but also between culture and technological materiality (data, algorithms, and networks). With this, the mediation affects the way cultural activities are perceived and performed.

But, have we now reached the end of cultural computing? In Apple’s 1984 advertisement video for the first Macintosh computer, an interface for conformity, absorbing the worker in a totalitarian state, was replaced by an interface for individual expression and do-it-yourself culture. Three decades later, the table is turning. According to a leaked NSA presentation it is now Apple who is Big Brother, and enthusiastic iPhone customers who are the zombies living in a surveillance state (Rosenbach et al 2013). The imagined free world of cultural computing has turned into a business of “controlled consumption” (Striphas 2010; Andersen and Pold 2014). To prevent piracy, software and hardware providers such as Apple, Amazon and Google have introduced a new cultural business model that involves a licensing system for cultural software and content. In short, cultural production becomes consumption – a matter of uploading content into the cloud, and selecting pre-configured filters. Although configurations are intrinsic to an interface culture, this has been taken to another level, and has turned into a ‘war on general purpose computing,’ as described by Cory Doctorow: the locking down of software into hardware turns the computer into an IT “appliance” (2011). Simultaneously, cultural consumption becomes production of data of what is read, looked at, listened to, etc., valuable in marketing as well as national defence. In this way, interface culture has been subsumed under a strictly monopolizing business model. The computer, which was originally developed as a military technology but redefined as emancipatory and revolutionary by Apple and others, is now back again where it began: as a military intelligence technology.

The above indicates that our interface culture has become ‘post-digital’: the digital expression holds less fascination, and digital culture is no longer the domain of DIY culture per se (see e.g., Cascone 2010, Cramer 2014, Cox 2014). Following this, and building on prior work on interface criticism (e.g., Andersen & Pold 2011), we propose six characteristics of the interface that we believe are important to address to critically reflect contemporary interface culture.

§1 The interface connects functionality with representation

The purpose of the interface is to connect functional acts with representations. These appear as icons, menus, command lines, signal sounds, speech control as well physically through buttons and other control units. Concordantly, the German computer semiotician and artist, Frieder Nake describes the computer as “an instrumental medium” (2000). We are simultaneously using it as a tool and communicating with it as a medium. This translation between signals (algorithms and executions) and signs (mediations and representations) positions the interface at the core of the computer, and furthermore defines its significance in our culture and society. With a representational dimension, technology becomes cultural – and reversely, representation becomes technological.

§2 The interface is displaced and repressed

Interfaces come from a tradition of engineering that paradoxically has tried to rid itself of it. The design guru Donald Norman says that the interface ‘is an obstacle: it stands between a person and the system being used’ (1990, 209). The dismissal of mediation is a driving force in much IT development, and has been framed as ’Virtual Reality’, ’Augmented Reality’, ’Bodily Interaction’, ’Calm Computing’ as well as design parameters such as minimalism, user friendliness, seamless interaction, etc. This repression is also part of a larger attempt to re-appropriate presence and immediacy by a differentiation of representation (see e.g., Jacques Derrida’s criticism of writing as a ‘dangerous supplement’ from 1967). Although, the interface designer seeks to bypass language and displace the semiotic processes of the interface, interaction will never be seamless and will always enforce a particular way of communicating with the computer (e.g., a particular way of (non-linear) reading), or as disconnections in the form of load or error messages, entering of passwords etc. With this, the user is reminded of an interaction that is not purely functional.

$3 The interface is an ideological construct

All kinds of both disconnections and forms of seduction in the relation between sign and signal mark a power relation. Whether the interface mediates between man and computer, between computers or between humans it will always reflect a balance of submission and control. This balance is often conditioned by ideology. On some occasions the user is seduced to interact without negotiating this relation – often through “gamification” and the use of play and narrative. This happens both in social media and on tablet platforms that integrate hardware and software, where the users voluntarily give away data that reveal their personal profiles as a condition for participation. On other occasions, as within free software culture, the participants demand a negotiation of the conditions of the interface. Christopher Kelty has referred to these as a “recursive public” that is ‘concerned with the material and practical maintenance and modification of the technical, legal, practical, and conceptual means of its own existence as a public’ (2008, 3).

§ 4 The interface has traditions and genres

Historically, the interface builds on three traditions.

Firstly, early developments within computing took place within a military context. Already during WW2, the computer was used for ballistics as well as cryptology. After the war, cybernetic defence systems for ground-to-air control where computers were used to calculate and predict potential air strikes, and to automatize counter moves. Such systems, like the American SAGE, characterized by the need to reduce human participation to computation, and to control and anticipate a course of events.

Secondly, military technology design in the sixties also developed a number of human-computer interaction techniques, including graphic manipulation, the mouse, and other controllers. These designs were further developed into ideas of general-purpose tools for ordinary people (in the spirit of the sixties and seventies, and in opposition to military computing). At Xerox PARC, for instance, the notion of a “user” whose behaviour and needs could be studied led to new ways of processing text, multimedia, collaborative workspaces, and much more; including the desktop interface and the use of metaphors in the representation of computer processes (the “desktop”, “trashcan”, “folder”, etc.).

Thirdly, experimentation with computers in the fifties and sixties also led to new forms of expression (many of these relating to Max Bense’s Stuttgart School and to Bell Labs and exhibited at the seminal Cybernetic Serendipity at the ICA in London, 1968). These include computer graphics (e.g., Frieder Nake, Vera Molnar, Manfred Mohr, Georg Nees), animation (e.g., John Whitney, Edward E. Zajac, Michael Noll), text (e.g., Theo Lutz, Christopher Strachey), and electro acoustic music (e.g., Erkki Kureniemi, Karl Heiz Stockhausen). Furthermore, we see the appearance of the computer game Spacewar! in 1963 as an early example of collaborative software development and the first widely used software program.

All of these traditions and the interplay between them still play a role in our interface culture as (automatized) monitoring, functional, and expressive.

§5 The interface is not (just) a surface

The interface is not restricted to the well-known “WIMP” (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers), known from the desktop interface. The interface includes several levels of contact surfaces and exchanges: between programs within the computer, between computers in a network, between human and computer, and between humans. Some interfaces are relatively mechanical (like the USB stick), but nevertheless also include standardised specifications on how interaction between devices must take place. Others (like the game-interface) are oriented towards human cognition and cultural traditions.

It is not possible to ‘unveil’ the computer interface, which always will appear in a ‘mise en abîme’ architecture where one translation between sign and signal will replace another: the code behind the interface is just another interface to deeper level. One level is not more essential than the other, but the interface can be critically reflected at all levels – as code, as platform, as sense-perception, etc. – each including references to technological, sociological, historical and political issues.

§ 6 The mechanisms of the interface constitutes the sensible

The interface is a multimedia that integrates sound, images, text and interaction in feedback-loops. It “sonifies”, “textifies” and visualises as it simultaneously listens, reads and sees through microphones, cameras, keyboards, sensors, GPS or data analysis. The cybernetic feedback-loop is a central part of the interaction between human and computer, and the interface is generated in a simultaneous reading of the computer and the user’s system. However, this coinciding registering and representation takes place at all levels of the interface. The multimedia as a cybernetic mechanisms constitute the sensible (even beyond the human) – i.e. the way we sense, what we sense, and how we act upon this.

Excerpts from the Shit-Fi Manifesto 

I. The “guilty pleasures” of serious music critics and fans tend toward mindless pop, the formerly fashionable, the ironic—toward pseudo-good music. But some of us, in fact, harbor no secret love for disco, hair metal, or grunge. We love bad music that could not be pop, music whose very existence is the dirty secret. Our bad music does not speak in the economic terms record labels understand. Our music originates in basements and garages in non-English-speaking countries or at the margins of the US scene and is recorded with primitive equipment. Our music is the demo and live recordings of bands already deemed too bizarre or untalented “to make it.” Our music is not just lo-fi, it is SHIT-FI.

The music industry, understood as a nexus of corporations concerned with recording and mastering technology, manufacture of playback media and devices, musical instruments, and musical taste, has been steadily obliterating the conditions under which our bad music could be produced for 25 years. The industry has deemed both the ideas behind our music and the means of its creation obsolete. In this obsolescence, we see the refusal of capitalist relations of production and consumption as codified by the music industry. This refusal may amount only to pinpricks, but even tiny holes in the dark fabric of global capitalism provide nourishing light. This is our attempt to face, with sober senses, the continuing trickle-down bankruptcy of the music industry. This is Shit-Fi.

II. On the one hand we are excited by the proliferation of new technologies for the free dissemination of music: MP3 blogs, file-transfer hosts, video- and file-sharing sites, etc. To us, these sites represent the democratization the Internet at its best, enabling the democratization of media it promised. On the other hand, we are deeply skeptical of digital recording, engineering, and mastering programs and widespread availability of technology that once was only for professionals. Rather than encouraging the experimentation and uniqueness that characterized amateur musical production 20–30 years ago, the ease of these technologies encourages homogenization. Easy-to-use digital technology, which can fix flaws in tempo, pitch, etc, can mask a lack of talent, but it saps music of the intangible qualities that make it powerful and vibrant. There has been no increase in the talent or skills of musicians in the years since the punk explosion—if anything, due to education cuts and myriad distractions, young people have less training today then previously—instead, there have been strong trends in music to artificially increase the appearance of skill and talent.
Shit-Fi seeks the bands that have fallen through the cracks of these trends. Bands that choose to define talent and skill in new ways. Bands proud to be flawed. Bands that do not use gadgets to sanitize and commercialize their sound. Shit-Fi seeks the bands that have fallen through the cracks of these trends. Bands that choose to define talent and skill in new ways. Bands proud to be flawed. Bands that do not use gadgets to sanitize and commercialize their sound. 
 
III. Shit-Fi proceeds from the axiom that professional production is not at all correlated with the power of music to affect one’s life. Whether we are dancers at a club or protesters chanting—or more likely, record collectors sitting home alone on a Friday night—it is the rhythm, the tune, the feeling that moves us. It is not production values. Would the Hells Angels not have murdered Meredith Hunter had Keith’s guitar been louder at Altamont? When Rock Against Racism inspired thousands to take a stand against discrimination, abuse, and violence, was anyone worried about the consistency of the beats-per-minute? Is one’s exuberance at stringing together three chords for the first time on a guitar diminished by the chords being slightly out of tune? The collective experience of music is certainly different from the private one, but we reject the implication that the enjoyment of music is proportional to the traditional talent displayed by its creators. The professionalization of rocknroll makes passive spectators out of fans. Participation today is not feeling, creating, or even thinking, it is telephoning in your vote for best cover version, and then buying.",Excerpts from the <em>Shit-Fi Manifesto</em>,,,,2014-09-15T16:35:25+00:00,12,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/12,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=154,154,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T12:13:18+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Digital Music, Shit-fi",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/154

We demand a new future, and a future for music
by: Adam Harper

We demand the future of music, and a musical future. This is to say we demand new and greater thought, communication, and representation in relation to sound, in relation to one another.

Mind The Gap #100

We can no longer accept every product in the iTunes music store, or every Top 40 in gold and platinum, or the great composers in marble, or centuries of the concert hall, or the record collectors’ most cherished numbers, or all the instruments in all the orchestras, or all the notes in all the scales and ready for the page, or all the sound in the world, as demarcating the horizon of our imaginations.

We have to find something further and deeper beyond these horizons. But our task is not to find the rules and formulas hidden deep within this idea we think we understand, music. Music is not waiting to be understood, its role is to modulate and reform understanding itself in ever newer ways. We can only keep its options in this ever more open. Our task is not to locate and manifest the one greatest musical work or locus of music, and plant it like a monument in human history.

Our task is now to smash rules and tastes carved in the stone age and rebuild them, and then smash them again. It is in the smashing and the rebuilding that human artistic activity lies, in that moment of energy and action, process and becoming, and not in its permanence. We are certain that there can be an increase in cultural capacity, information and possibility, in options, like this, but we are also certain that there will be losses too. Our task is also to truly savour both the new and the lost, even as it slips through our human fingers.

Communication

But why are we in need of new music? The horizons of our imaginations appear pretty broad, after all – broader, possibly, than ever before, although perhaps less possibly deeper than before. Herein lies the problem. This idea will lead us to suppose that we have largely finished composing new music, that the concert hall, the record store, the museum is built, and that all we need to do is fill it, buy from it and maintain it.
Global society suffers the same problem – the illusion of completeness, the permanence of the status quo, the end of history. It often appears that free-market capitalism is the only possible system and that it already contains or will contain all the riches the human race will ever have. It often appears that fossil fuels and increasing carbon in the atmosphere is the only way we can run a civilisation. It often appears that private must triumph over public, that the individual is the only meaningful composite unit of this civilisation, and that their passions and problems are theirs and theirs alone. It often appears that we can do nothing except sit back and enjoy the ride. It often appears that all we really need are our desert island discs, as we are washed up alone on our own private, burning, lifeless islands. Everything else is just contributing to the deficit.

It often appears that music is a form of entertainment, but it is one of our species’ most important modes of communication. In the way it sounds and the way it is performed, it represents us all, our feelings, identities and desires. Music is a vote that all too frequently goes uncounted. It is a thought passing along the neural net formed by our entire planet.

I repeat, the task of music is never completed or made permanent. There are further limitations and uneven distributions of musical possibility than are apparent. You might be aware, for example, that there are many ways to experience music other than to listen to it as an object. You can interact with it, you can make it yourself, however you like. You don’t have to wait for the professionals, or the gig, or the commercial release. Then there are subtleties, fusions and joys in musical language that we have not yet discovered, that lie beneath or beyond our current perception, as if in the time before you ever tried that cuisine, or added that colour to the rainbow.

One century ago futurist painter and composer Luigi Russolo published his famous manifesto ‘The Art of Noises. One hundred years later Gonzo (circus) magazine publishes a new manifesto by Adam Harper, author of ‘Infinite Music’. The manifesto comes with the special edition of Mind The Gap #100 with tracks by 13 musicians introducing some possible new futures of music. Read the tracklist here or order your copy of Gonzo (circus) #113 + Mind The Gap #100 here.

Noise

There is further to see, and more to come. Yet the first and only path to this future is that we don’t know what music will be in the future. We don’t even know what it is in the present, or the past, not fully. It is from this admission that we can adopt the only perspective that will genuinely prepare the space the future will occupy. All we know of the future is that the landscape of concepts through which we understand musical production today, and for the past hundreds and thousands of years even, will be different.

The further and more audaciously we go into the future, the more different this landscape will probably be. Following this realisation to its conclusion, we discover that there will be a hypothetically infinite number of concepts through which we understand musical production, which is perhaps also to say that there’ll be no musical concepts worth the name, or none that are absolute.

In this way music is a signal, but in reading the signal there is also noise. If there is one thing you can say about music history, it’s that the music of the future has always been noise. There are many definitions for this word, but the most generally applicable is ‘unwanted sound’. It’s not just the noisiness of twentieth-century musicians such as Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Varèse and Russolo that shows this principle, but that of every previous century too, those in which the noisiness is now so accepted that we can barely perceive it any more. The ratio of noise to signal (to music) is always decreasing, but there is absolutely no reason to think that the noise of tomorrow has been vanquished.

What effect might this difference, and this infinite difference, have on music as we (think we) know it? We could start with the concepts we (think we) used to understand musical production in the past, and in some layer of the present. Melody, harmony, rhythm, the work, performance, style, instrument, composers, audiences. For some of us, these concepts represent the divine laws of music, but the musicians of the future will tell us that they were blunt tools. These concepts will seem like Plato’s four elements do next to the periodic table of their future, or to go one step further, to the Standard Model of particle physics, whose impression was felt this year at CERN. There will be more beyond even that. Even the most progressive music-lover living today would regard the music of the future as noisy in ways that would break their heart.

Transported into the thirty-fifth century, you might find people listening to and sending each other tiny bursts of what sounds like nothing but noise, like brief electric shocks, and finding in these bursts all they need for a musical life they consider many times richer than any in human history. You would protest, and ask what had happened to Beethoven and Miles Davis and Michael Jackson, but they’d be left behind like flint knives or medicinal leeches. Yet the speed of your descendents’ brains is such that, on both a neural and cultural level, these bursts of noise have a richness you cannot process. Will you tell them they are wrong, that they have blasphemously destroyed what is good? Perhaps it is appropriate that you will probably be dead by then.

Creative destruction

Let’s smash, then, what is ‘good’ and proper to music. We can proceed, concept by concept, until there is nothing but complete noise, that is to say, complete music.

The Melody

It is all melody, none of it is. To require that music have a melody is to require that atop every lady or gentleman’s head there should be an impeccably coiffured powdered wig. For decades, more and more of us have known that music needs no melody to fascinate us and to turn us into completely new people. A melody is merely one kind of structure of musical information.

We are no longer beholden to any idea about the traditional melody’s length, range, timbre, change over time, and use of musical parameters.

The music of the future will be broken down into structures of continuity and difference of some sort, and we will cherish those structures, but they will not be melodies as understood traditionally. Already there are entire cultural lifetimes of music dedicated to alternative structures like the groove, the riff, the loop, the sample, the drop, the texture, and it is only the most antiquated listeners that bemoan this. But watch: this pattern, this movement away from a traditional concept, will be repeated on greater, stranger and more fundamental scales in the music of the future.

Harmony

Perhaps the first musical tool to have been sharpened by modernity, and many times in its history. To say there are no laws about which notes must go together and which must not is now to be at least 130 years old. It might be that there are only two truths about harmonic process: everything is harmonious and everything is discordant. There is simply temporary movement between the two. In the eighteenth century, parallel triads were a musical disaster. Now most listeners and even perhaps most musicians would need a little training to hear what makes them different from the rest of conventional harmony.

There are conjunctions in the music of the future that will have a quaint nostalgia for the name ‘harmony’, and its makers will have a deep plan for it we will not understand.

Rhythms

Another musical site that has already been expanded in capacity, the rhythms of the future could be so subtle that nobody today would perceive their shifts and workings, or so free and unimportant that the music eschews any relationship to time, depending on the chosen language. A rhythm need not limit itself to the scale of melody or loops, of course. Rhythm is the microsonic oscillation that appears to us as its own dimension, pitch, as well as the birth and winking out of stars and civilisations.

The Work

Here we edge onto the concerns of the present. It might be that in the music of the future, the appeal of already-composed musical works and pieces within the totality of musical experience would be no more dominant than the appeal of re-runs of old events are to the constantly new excitements of sporting activity, or the appeal of a single photograph in comparison to a constantly changing landscape.

In the future we will wonder at how we came to believe music could only be such if it was distilled into an infinitely calculated chunk – a ‘piece’ – of essential thought that we honestly believed could ever be repeated. In the future there will not be musical works so much as more and more rooms for us to enter and return to, whose contents we and others will change, and whose windows will brighten and darken with the seasons.

The Performance

The musicians of the future may remember a time when there were only a few stages for music, and only a few ways to use that stage. New musical venues are opening on the internet, in our eyes, in our minds, and in our living environments all the time. In fact, all these things are our living environments. We can expect the border between ‘the performance’ and ‘life itself’ to become a continuum, and then dissolve, as it already has in a number of cases. Certainly the formal and official nature of the performance will be broken down in a broader, more demonstrative repeat of the recent shift from black tie in concert dress to slightly more casual attire. One day, we might not even have to change our clothes for musical activity at all.

The Style

This is one of the most heated debates in underground music, particularly, but there is little to say about it. Music will be as if occupying a style, or it will not be. It will repeat something from somewhere else, or it will not, as we like. We hope that no-one will declare war over this.

The Instrument

Such will be the flexibility, we hope, of the world of the future that its musicians will no longer see a final distinction in kind between the instrument as we buy, sell and maintain them, and any other musical object we are dissolving today. They will say, ‘why was that pop song, that sonata, that record, that mp3 device, that multimedia game, not a musical instrument, given that, as you admit, you played them and thus created music’, and we, who have long decomposed, will not be able to answer.

The Composer

Music created by a single human being, or even a designated group of human beings, is an old story about how the world was created. Already we are beginning see that music has been created by everyone whose ears have received it, that it was created by the Universe practically by accident. Upon visiting the future, we will notice music emanating from machines whose multiplicity of human and non-human components we cannot fathom, and it will frighten us like the flashlight frightens the pre-Neolithic man. The future will be relatively unmoved.

The Audience

Surely we can’t smash the audience too!? In that there is a group of participants in the musical activity whose role is simply to witness the ‘audio’, we hope so. The music and the audience should not be on opposite sides of an exchange, but indistinguishable within a holistic, mutual music-making. There is still perception, but no longer should there be a removed and sonically subordinated audience.

We hope that the musical creativity of the future will be collective and readily accessed, as well as flexible in ways that contemporary electronic musics have only just begun to apply. With the stroke of a finger on a screen, or in the air, or in the mind, anyone with the slightest interest in doing so should be able to generate live or recorded music and modulate its characteristics infinitely and infinitesimally. This will not be a solipsistic activity only, but a part of a sublime musical project spanning thousands and thousands of participants, each a listener, a composer and an instrument in a single process. It will not be reducible to melodies, harmonies, rhythms, works, mere performances, or a single responsible composer, or a spectacle aimed towards an audience. It will be infinitely continuous, and yet also, at every moment, infinitesimal in the differences that give it its magnificence.

Music

Finally of course, there is one more concept we will dethrone and dissolve: music itself. At the very least, its definition will be radically retranslated over the coming epochs. The ‘musicians’ of the future will probably disagree with us as to what it is they are making.

J.S. Bach will have stormed out of the Throbbing Gristle gig, and Throbbing Gristle will have stormed out of empty temples.

A Manifesto For The Original Art Form Of Electronic Dance Music Production.
A Manifesto For The True School.

My Art is the production of music, predominantly music for dancing, using technology.
One of my goals is to encourage inventiveness in a medium that has no boundaries.

What is the “True School”?

True School is respecting the old and embracing the NEW – new melodies, new beats, new sounds, new rhythms, new harmonies, new textures.
True School is Deep Attention.
True School is pushing your Art forward.
True School is being true to yourself which encourages others to be true to themselves.
True School is dancing only when you feel it.
True School is knowing louder is not necessarily better.
True School is knowing bigger is not necessarily better.
True School is respecting your audience.
True School is knowing the roots of the music you’re producing.
True School is knowing that the music and the dance floor is more important than the DJ. This is not a spectator sport.
True School is demanding good sound.
True School is not ripping off the Old School.
True School is not remixing without permission and putting it out into public domain.
True School is not faking it but making it.
True School is not fetishizing the machines or the format. This just distracts from the content.
True School is taking yourself seriously and having fun. If you really feel the music, you feel serious about it and what you feel is pure, unadulterated fun.
True School is not going through the motions with hands-in-the-air fake fuckery.
True School is not being afraid to play original tracks.
True School is not trying to make fast cash out of old hit records or borrowing other people’s names to make yourself known.

I openly discourage throwaway DJ-based music production as it stands today i.e. taking large chunks of other people’s music, illegally or not, looping it, and adding a few beats / percussion / vocals over the top and calling it your own track without crediting the original artist and THEN swearing vinyl is the saviour of music meanwhile they starve the original artist.

One Example. Searchin’ – 33 1/3 Queen vs Blow Your House Down – A Guy Called Gerald
There are many, many more.

It seems to me that the dance music industry, when it comes to inventiveness, is stuck in it’s own loop and the groove is getting very tired.

This Art is being lost to money grabbers and fakers. I welcome comments and discussion.

I welcome you to the True School.

A Manifesto

(18.01.2011)

[in-depth version - for bite-size version, scroll down to end --->]



Introduction: Tirade

The premise of this manifesto is to address a much-discussed issue in a new and uncompromising way. This idea that classical music, or art music, has reached ‘crisis point’ is a fairly familiar one to anyone with interest invested in the art-form. The various ‘problems’ (often involving shrinking audience size and demographic) can be listed and debated, and are likely big talking points amongst the major institutions (concert halls, opera houses, orchestras, academies, universities, festivals, etc.), while they will occasionally surface in arts columns in specialist magazines and culture supplements of broadsheet newspapers. The debates are, of course, invariably waged by those who are already part of classical music culture as it presently exists. I’m sure the columns which touch on subjects like discount opera tickets for young people or repertoire choice for the Last Night of the Proms are, likewise, glanced at only by people who already have some idea of the status quo.

This ‘crisis’ in art music, then, is a talking point for the privileged insiders who are not themselves necessarily at risk of exclusion or alienation, being already initiated. Everyone else – the public in general – couldn’t care less. No-one’s really complaining, because there is a lot of music in society and there is a lot of new art, it just so happens that new art music doesn’t really get a look in. And so the solutions that are proposed are small, and every little victory seems proof for many that there is no fundamental problem. Fans of new music, and contemporary composers themselves, have come to accept and even relish the near-insignificant role that their art has been left with in contemporary society. Meanwhile, in more mainstream classical music institutions, the furious rate at which modern culture has progressed, and the way in which culture is made to constantly represent itself in our media-saturated world, has left the initiates holding onto some very strange and often totally irrelevant values, and attempting to uphold them if only to maintain some sense of self-possession.

What seems to be totally lacking is any real aspiration. For many complex reasons, which include classical music’s reliance on institutions, its complicated, learned language, and the mistaken belief that re-performance constitutes revitalisation, the scope of those responsible for classical music’s place in society can be incredibly limited (and limiting). Of course, this is largely due to the way classical music has chosen to relate itself to other musics in society, specifically commercial, industrial pop music (and I use this term in its broadest possible sense). At some point, the classical establishment apparently made the decision to ‘work around’ pop music, to differentiate itself from it, to present itself as an alternative and contrasting presence, and by maintaining a separate identity, avoid being swallowed up by it. However, pop music has expanded since the 1960s into (arguably) the most powerful and prevalent art-form in English-speaking society, and new art music, by continuing its policy of maintaining a distant and alternative stance (and I’m not just talking about what I’d call the ‘substance’ of the music, but also every aspect of its presentation, meaning and purpose), has been pushed into a ridiculously tiny niche and made to represent and protect some very alien values and practices.

And so we have reached a point when, for society as a whole (and what is culture without society?), ‘classical music’ means a very small, specific and limited thing, and that thing just so happens to totally exclude any claim to contemporaneity or newness. It is not just the public in general who wouldn’t be able to name any living composers (besides possibly film composers, and the relegation of new orchestral music to a subsidiary, sub-visual medium is by no means a creative solution, even if some might protest otherwise) but also people who are interested in new art, those who are immersed in the cultural moment in all other art-forms, and even artists themselves in other fields. It is this shameful set of circumstances that concerns the crux of this manifesto.

Art music is no longer a cultural force; in fact, it is all but irrelevant. Most of the reformist agendas in classical music institutions at the moment seem to aim towards universal accessibility, targeting the absolute mainstream. This is not a regenerative solution; it is not particularly creative (it can actually be quite cynical) and it definitely does not favour new music. Classical music is the only art-form (apart from maybe poetry) in which new contemporary work is not the key focus, and the belief amongst the institutions that this fact somehow gives it its own special quality is a dangerous fallacy and will permit its descent into total insignificance.

Bearing this in mind, in the document below I outline a reformist agenda which focuses on an entirely new approach to the production of new art music, with the intention of restoring orchestral/chamber/choral/vocal/electroacoustic music to a position of relevance and power within a culture that is defined and mediated by a cutting edge of mutually-aware artistic trends. I begin by outlining a few specific problems which must be addressed, or in some cases just actually acknowledged. I then list the ultimate aims of a potential new movement, before cataloguing some immediate solutions, first in composition and then in other areas of classical music culture, before concluding by answering some potential criticisms. It should be mentioned that the kind of developments which this movement would entail are already being seen in various instances around the world. Many of the solutions which I posit have been presented by recent composers and musicians. What there doesn’t seem to be is a proper acknowledgement of the need for drastic and widespread reform, some possible reasons for which I will explore further in the concluding section.



1. Problems

i. Lack of presence and relevance as a living art-form

As mentioned above, one of the most worrying aspects of art music’s present situation is that it really doesn’t have the kind of presence in the media and in culture as a whole that other art-forms have. Obviously, alongside pop music perhaps, film and television have the greatest presence as new and evolving artistic cultures. There is a huge general awareness of the key people producing films and television dramas today, as well as of the current state of the art-form – recent trends, important works, etc. Most importantly, new works are eagerly anticipated and consumed by society as a whole. But it is not just these mass-distributed art-forms that make art music seem obscure.

Fiction, visual art and theatre place great significance in the production of new works, whilst living novelists, artists and playwrights/directors will often become household names and even familiar faces, their fame accompanied by some awareness of their own particular qualities or style. Advertising for new exhibitions and productions can rely on the promise of contemporaneity, as well as celebrity, to draw in those groups who want to experience culture as it is made. Interviews can even be published in newspapers with a reasonable expectation that anyone with a passing interest in new art might be intrigued enough to read. However, none of this is true of contemporary classical composers. This kind of position has instead been adopted wholesale by pop music, which has grown into a vast and rich culture that includes its own heady heights of erudition. For young people who want to feel culture-savvy, a knowledge of new independent pop music is of tremendous value, up there with a knowledge of independent cinema and new photography and conceptual art trends. Amongst all this, I’d be surprised if many of these people actually knew that new classical music was still being written. The worst problem is that, to a lot of people in classical music, this doesn’t seem to matter – music is still being performed. There might be a bit of publicity in the broadsheets for a ‘legendary’ conductor, or a new opera staging by a famous film director, and then it might seem like classical music does have a place in the media, but this is always comparatively tiny, and besides, new renderings of old scores do not constitute new works.

The plain fact is that people do not consider classical music of any importance in the definition of our contemporary culture, and they would be right because it  seems to purposefully shirk any such importance. Institutions are more concerned with getting children inspired by eighteenth-century composers than they are with instilling any sense that art music has the capacity to represent modern society. Where art music was once deeply involved with other parallel artistic movements in the creation of a cultural moment or zeitgeist, there is now very little such connection. This is partly because other artists are probably not aware of what is going on in the obscure world of new music, but also because pop music has easily risen to fill this role. And there are good reasons why pop music, as it exists, is more suited to cross-media collaborations, and to the giving and taking of inspiration: aesthetic, socio-political and semiotic reasons, none of them inherent to pop as a sonic practice but all of them dependent on quite arbitrary cultural dogma on the part of classical music traditions.

Of course, I do not need to go out on a limb to attest that this kind of cultural irrelevance is actually quite new for art music, and yet the idea that we should try to regain such relevance doesn’t seem to interest most musicians. I would argue that this attitude can be traced to classical music’s attempts to represent itself as distinct from pop music which, while attempting an apparent alignment to some fundamental and ostensibly virtuous aesthetic principles, involved carefully alienating itself from pretty much every quality that would go on to ensure artistic potency and relevance in any medium.

ii. Aesthetic preoccupations

A lot has been written on the isolationist, conservative ideals which have been carried over into modern music from Romanticism. These constitute an aesthetic bias towards ‘absoluteness’, or art which transcends society and real life to function on a quasi-spiritual plain – art that is purely of itself. This kind of attitude towards music, which purports to attain universality and timelessness, will only guarantee universal alienation. It is the kind of aesthetic which is utterly in opposition with the art of our time. It is true that, since the end of musical modernism at its most extreme, there have been plenty of moves to undermine these ridiculous value claims. However, while such aesthetic absolutes might now seem problematic to many of the custodians of classical music (though by no means all of them), there is still an absolute wealth of assumptions and values, many of them completely unconscious, which lie half-buried beneath all musicians’ understanding of their own musical tradition. These are ingrained from the moment we see our first clef or play our first key on the piano, they are the assumptions on which the biggest classical music institutions are based, and they are used pitilessly to advertise classical music to the masses. They are all completely arbitrary, many of them in fact paradoxical, and in combination they relentlessly limit the remit of what art music could be, while individually they more often than not present some kind of barrier between the experience of art music and the understanding of uninitiated potential appreciators.

What follows is a list of values, qualities or ideals which are meant to be implicit to art music (or, more specifically, ‘good’ art music) but which are in actuality completely arbitrary in their provenance and have nothing to do with art music’s material substance:

depth +++++ complexity +++++ beauty +++++ subtlety

universality +++++ transcendence +++++ truthfulness +++++ spirituality

erudition +++++ purity +++++ directness +++++ timelessness

‘soul’/‘heart’ +++++ intellect/logic +++++ seriousness

forward-looking +++++ within a tradition +++++ re-performable/non-specific

composed by a single author +++++ composed for a non-specific audience

capable of objective ‘greatness’

While all of these might be viewed as positive aspects of any artwork, they would not be considered necessarily emblematic of an art-form as a whole, or identified as particular benchmarks to which all examples of a given art-form should aspire. However it is part of the experience of being an initiate to classical music that these qualities can be considered particular to the unique process of your own artistic language. They are all traces of the damaging dogma of Romanticism, and yet I would say with some confidence that no-one in the classical music world would be prepared to relinquish particular ownership of all of them. Moreover, they can all be viewed as opposing qualities to pop music, and they all suggest both cultural elitism and, paradoxically, an emphasis on a ‘learned’ culture as well as the smug claim to an inherent ‘intuitive’ effectiveness.

Perhaps the most enduring of these preoccupations amongst composers of new music is a huge emphasis on being ‘progressive’ while at the same time remaining ‘part of a tradition’, on ‘looking back’ at the past while at the same time always ‘looking forward’ to the future. Maintaining a connection to a past tradition and repertory of music is seen as a very positive quality in new composition, since it seems to work towards composers’ obsession with producing enduring pieces that will ‘stay in the repertoire’, by consciously forcing them into some kind of timeline. It is the same obsession, along with a keen sense of the teleological flow of music history, that creates an imperative to be progressive, ironically enough often miring new music at a particular point in high modernism in altercation with the ‘simpler’, less technically ‘developed’ postmodern tendencies of pop music.

New music is largely alone in its proud boasts of concurrent forward and backward vision, since most new art is content to represent the present – to be of the here-and-now. This is, after all, where the actual audience is situated, and it’s where the other artists are too. Once again, though, ‘now’-ness is seen as the domain of pop music, and therefore art music has, of late, decided to avoid it.

iii. Alienation of the young

It has been much commented on that classical music has become quite overwhelmingly an area of interest for older people, in many cases elderly people. The reasons for this are, of course, multifarious. But the depth of this problem is often understated. It is true that the big venues and ensembles, with their rotation of ‘canonical’ favourites, tend to attract older people. There is a lot of effort going into opening these mainstream classical institutions up to younger audiences, often by addressing certain socio-cultural stereotypes which do link in at some level to the assumed qualities listed above.

Some would probably say that this is the wrong approach, and that mainstream art rooted in tradition will always be the domain of older people, while it is the newer and more experimental areas of the art-form which should be attracting young people. This is all very well, but the problem remains that, within this art-form which has very little real prestige in society, new music has very little prestige within the culture itself. It is almost completely side-lined, possibly because it doesn’t seem to be commercially attractive, possibly because classical music cannot help but target the older audience whose attendance has been proven. It’s a vicious cycle, which repeatedly prevents the possibility of new art music presenting itself as important.

My point is that the focus of any art-form should be its creative presence within contemporary society. Museum wings and history lessons are fine, as long as there is an acknowledgement that this contemporary focus be maintained. What’s more, this creative presence should be primarily the domain of the younger generations. It is short-sighted, cynical and pointless to try and excite young people with old art, at the expense of supporting new music. It seems incredibly lazy on the part of the institutions, but it is another result of those same elitist assumptions that there is something about the status quo that is fundamentally ‘as it should be’.

Young people, especially young artists and people who are interested in art, naturally assume the role of culture-makers. There is little interest in experiencing culture of the past, or culture of the future; such pursuits are arguably illusory anyway. Between the ages of maybe 15 and 40, we are empowered to shape the boundaries of our culture and, especially in the age of the internet, this involves consumption, appreciation and criticism just as much as it involves composition or performance, or any other traditional ‘creative’ process. So the emphasis, throughout traditional and new classical music, throughout all the institutions, and the media and every other aspect of its presentation and representation, on the invented qualities listed above, which deny the importance of the immediate present over past and future, ensure that any semblance of contemporaneity in classical music culture is automatically problematised.

Yet again, this entire outlook seems to have been constructed in opposition to the values of pop music, which are youth-oriented and ephemeral and rooted in the present. This opposition is, at times, so strong that classical culture can seem to take an offensive stance against pop music, and to be quite simply anti-youth. A culture which takes such a stance would seem to be taking pains to kill itself.

iv. Music for musicians

The attitude that is doing the most damage to classical music, especially with respect to new music, is also the one that is the deepest-rooted and the most difficult to shift. It comes as a result of the institutionalisation of the whole of art music culture.

It has always been a problem that musical skills cannot really be self-taught, meaning that pretty much everyone involved has at some point to pass through an institution (which could be anything from a school piano teacher to a conservatoire). This needn’t be an issue in theory, but in practice it exposes musicians to a whole host of false, elitist assumptions. Some of these, in abstract form, have been discussed above, but there are others, the most prevalent and dangerous being the idea that it is acceptable that music be for musicians.

Most musicians who harbour this assumption probably wouldn’t realise that they do so; it doesn’t present itself as a problem, since classical music culture has already suffered so much that non-musicians are simply not present for comment. People assume that music can be for musicians because, in many cases, the only people who go to concerts are musicians. Modern composers can build their pieces around complex academic structures which require a knowledge of music theory to appreciate, and they can be safe in the knowledge that only people who can appreciate such structures will actually listen to these pieces. New music is already a secret society, and it therefore seems to those initiates that using secret languages and symbols is acceptable (and enjoyable), because there’s no-one there to complain. Of course, this is a complacent, elitist attitude which is guaranteed to completely alienate any non-musicians who might be interested in new music as a contemporary art-form. But this attitude extends to pretty much everyone professionally or academically involved with art music. They are surrounded by people who speak the same language, and they have very little recourse to contact with any non-speakers because art music no longer has a large enough scope to attempt to engage non-musicians.

For educators and reformists, the solution seems to be to make more people into musicians at an earlier age. Their premise: Music is for musicians, so we can open music up by creating more musicians. But does this not seem like an absurd approach to quite a basic problem? Art is not for artists; galleries are not solely frequented by skillful sculptors and sketchers. You don’t even need a grasp of recent art history to fully appreciate most contemporary exhibitions. Film is most definitely not for film-makers, books aren’t for writers, theatre is not for actors and directors. This all seems natural and obvious. But moreover, most of society appreciates and understands pop music in great depth, without needing any understanding of harmony or rhythm or production techniques, or even cultural theory. So why is it acceptable for classical music to require specialist knowledge? And why is it OK for composers to write pieces ‘about’ music itself, which require analytical listening to interpret? Continuing their quest for ‘absoluteness’, new composers constantly reject an engagement with the society, people and culture of today, to instead write music that engages only with music, with music of the past or with some inherent quality of music itself. Behind it all is a universal belief, hidden much deeper in some than others, that this is what classical music is ‘for’, that this is inherent to the material of classical music as opposed to other musics or art-forms, and therefore that this is what ‘good’ classical music ‘should be’. And while these elitist assumptions – this delight in secret knowledge and comfort taken in an archaic tradition – remain at the back of all musicians’ consciousnesses, there will always be a hesitancy to let non-musicians in, and to be part of a culture that is actually relevant and important to society in general.

Classical music has been in a rut for a lot longer than it would care to acknowledge, and because everyone has gotten used to its new obscure place, there is no longer any real vision to give it any more of a presence than what it currently enjoys. Those who aren’t a part of it are untroubled by it, and those who are initiated enjoy their privileged access. Meanwhile, art music doesn’t serve any of the roles that new art does in other media. Pop music has taken up all these roles, and is doing a splendid job. But is our society now so fundamentally different that these roles cannot be served by orchestras or chamber groups or choirs, but must now be served by guitars or drum machines or synthesisers? Of course not. There are differences between art and pop music, but they are all at material, structural levels. All the rest has been invented out of jealousy or bigotry, and smoothly institutionalised from the moment we first learn to recognise middle C.

2. Overall Aims

i. Separatism

Because of the absolute ubiquity of certain damaging attitudes and assumptions within the music institutions, any new musical movement must be rooted and cultivated outside of these institutions. There are far too many general preconceptions about the nature of centralised classical music, and far too much vested interest from the people who currently hold the power, to attempt addressing each issue one by one. The new movement must be totally disconnected from the source of all these unproductive attitudes. It should, in short, attempt to alienate all of those people who rely on centralised classical culture’s traditions and prejudices. This means that the focus will need to be on small-scale, grassroots projects to start with, utilising independent or alternative funding opportunities. Only by completely cutting off the assumed membership of the institutionalised initiates will this culture seem open to non-musicians, just as only a completely removed artistic culture will free composers and musicians from the subconscious expectations of their learned backgrounds. The new movement shouldn’t feel like a break-off or schism from mainstream musical culture, a rebellious faction characterised by opposition (although in practice some opposition will be important), but it should instead feel like its own unique, positive entity.

ii. New alignments

Just because this movement should be consciously disconnected from the status quo of classical music culture doesn’t mean that it can’t have a solid basis and strong connections from which to take shape. The new art music culture should develop from a genuine and unqualified engagement with, firstly, contemporary culture and society and, secondly, the cutting edge of other artistic disciplines.

The quickest and most fruitful way to grow this new movement as a separatist entity from institutional classical music, and as a movement which aims to specifically redress the alienating, limiting features which have shrunken classical music’s  contemporary relevance, is to engage specifically with those aspects of culture and society that art music has traditionally excluded – to be wilfully contrarian and iconoclastic. Therefore, an engagement with youth and popular cultures should be a major focus. By creating effective musical experiences which have nothing to do with, or actively work against, the traditional values assigned to art music, any association with off-putting institutions will be nullified, and from there musical material can be reclaimed which might presently be dismissed for its unattractive connotations.

By concentrating on an engagement with artistic trends in other fields, musicians will be dissuaded from obsessing over ‘their own’ culture and its history, and thereby excluding non-initiates. Furthermore, this approach should help attract interest from appreciators of other art-forms. Classical music has, for a long time, been an isolationist culture in terms of overall aesthetic trends. This isolationism is seen by many as a particular virtue of the art-form, but it has only meant that modern music has not developed with the rest of modern art. It is important that, rather than attempt to establish itself in isolation, this new movement adheres closely to these more developed artistic cultures. This is the only way that new music can hope to attract the attention of art-conscious non-musicians.

iii. A new audience

There is a specific demographic to which I believe new music should be directly appealing, an audience in the making who have so far remained alienated by utterly irrelevant elitist preoccupations. This is the international, powerful, unified and regenerative culture of young people who closely follow alternative, independent and experimental pop music. These are more often than not the same young people who follow trends in other new art-forms, especially visual art, fashion and film. The factors that stop this group’s interest in experimental music from extending into the spectrum of new art music (and it does come very close) is not anything materially specific to classical music. It is not dissonance, or the sound of a bassoon, or counterpoint. It is not structures that extend for a duration of more than eight minutes. The only things that get in the way are cultural associations, modes of presentation and aesthetic concerns, none of which are fundamental to art music’s actual substance. This is an audience who can feel deeply involved in a musical culture without any specialist technical knowledge. There is nothing that should stop this same audience from feeling involved in a culture of new art music, provided that specialist technical knowledge is not expected of them. By actively opening up new music to them, along with other older musical repertories that can eventually be approached on these new terms, this movement would simultaneously adopt a very culturally-powerful new audience whilst satisfying a burgeoning desire for innovation amongst followers of alternative pop music.

iv. New Materialism

The greatest potential remedy to the self-destructive aesthetic bias of classical music culture would be a completely new attitude to the art-form. A shift towards ‘New Materialism’, promoting qualities of ephemerality, immediacy, disposability, transience, specificity and changeability, would be helpful on at least two distinct levels. Firstly, it would encourage an engagement with the culture and society of the immediate present, of worldly things – whether ‘everyday’, socio-political, or having to do with our immediate cultural zeitgeist – which art music has constantly excused itself from, to its own great detriment. It would involve, as mentioned above, taking inspiration from and finding a place within youth and popular cultures. It would preclude an alienating preoccupation with music’s own place within music history, apart from as a direct commentary on our contemporary milieux, and it would totally inhibit the unhealthy and egotistical drive towards timelessness, universal relevance and ‘canonisation’ which still subconsciously characterises a lot of new work. Using the immediate present as subject and substance will maximise the potential audience, while permitting an easy exchange of ideas between other artistic cultures.

At the same time though, taking a ‘New Materialist’ approach to classical music culture as a whole will encourage a new and up-to-date system of production and consumption which could replace the unrealistic expectations that classical music has of itself. The new movement should cultivate a living and constantly changing music culture centred on new music rather than the regular re-playing of old music. This would only involve a reform along the lines of every other artistic culture in the modern world, reflecting the power of mass media and global online communication. Importantly, it would address classical music’s aversion to value systems which operate on a short-term scale – the domains of fashion and ‘coolness’ – which are no less valid value systems and, while held in suspicion by at least some factions of most artistic cultures, are only properly forbidden by classical music culture. This new approach should involve a wholesale embrace of new media, an acknowledgement of the possibilities of commercialism and, hopefully, a completely new way of judging the ‘essential’ qualities of art music. A living, evolving approach to ‘disposable’ new music should necessitate constant production without the constant need to assess ‘progressiveness’, while, ideally, hierarchical structures from innovation to trendsetting and thence to a receptive mainstream should emerge, which should match other trickle-down models of cultural consumption.

A healthy art-form is an art-form which is defined by its newest buds, which is allowed to constantly replace itself without worrying about the longevity of its composite parts, and which is kept alive by regeneration, not by some process of fossilisation. To achieve such peaks of health, a new art music movement would have to completely cut itself off from the constricting traditions and values of its own establishment, but it does have a lot of other artistic trends and institutions that it can take cues and inspiration from – first and foremost, those of popular music.

3. Compositional Solutions

i. Engagement with popular music

There are two reasons why art music should be looking to contemporary pop music for inspiration. The first, as I’ve already discussed, is that, in delineating what art music ‘is’ (or ‘should be’) as distinct from pop, its remits have become smaller and smaller while pop’s have grown to fill all the empty space. It has fallen to pop to take on the role of a music that remains in touch with the changing structures, communication and media networks, and socio-political contours of modern society. Therefore, pop effortlessly remains a music that ‘works’ as a modern art-form. What essentially characterises pop music (structures, timbres, tropes etc.) is only a small part of this, and there’s no reason why art music shouldn’t be able to borrow liberally from its systems.

However, art music also needs to go further than this. In order to attract the new audience that potentially await them, composers should be drawing on a universal familiarity with the language of pop music to create inlets into their own musical styles, to ease comprehension and attract attention, and quite simply to state the intention of welcoming non-initiates into their culture. It would be a gesture of humility, but one that is long overdue. Not only has alternative pop music been proven to function as an important and relevant musical avant-garde in our modern society (and one that is actually growing in prevalence, thanks to the power of the internet), but the borders of pop and art musics have also very rarely been so close (thanks in large part to developments in electronic music and minimalism). Inspiration can be taken from pop music at a number of different levels, from very subtle to very open, but I would suggest that, the more blatant the connection, the more effective the gesture will be. The history of art music is absolutely riddled with evidence of composers taking elements directly from contemporary pop music sources, to great effect. Below I have listed a few example ways in which this could be achieved on a musical level:

Use of borrowed musical material from pop songs (including electronic samples)
Mimicking familiar pop structures, rhetorical gestures and timbres
Exploring moods and tones specific to pop music, eg. personal/confessional, sexualised, dance-oriented, etc.
Mimicking pop production processes, including electronic processes
Composers writing their own, specific, vernacular ‘lyrics’ which function as part of the original musical work
Use of non-trained vocalists/non-‘classical’ vocal styles
All of these could easily be worked into traditionally textured, orchestrated and dimensioned classical music, without any real compromise of technical compositional properties. Moreover, any one of these would instantly require enough innovation and creativity in its reconciliation with the language of art music that it would automatically justify its own composition. On top of this, I would advocate a shift, if not towards tonality, then at least towards an increased sense of melodicism. This doesn’t mean lyricism; pop’s qualities of ‘catchiness’ and immediacy are invaluable to any modern art-form, while the genre has expanded the nature of the ‘hook’ to a very broad definition.

I think a lot of recent art music that has ostensibly borrowed from pop has been quite unimaginative about it. I don’t think that the actual use of an electric guitar or turntables and synthesisers is necessarily the best way to engage creatively with the unique ideas and processes of pop music; I think such solutions, while occasionally very effective, can be used to cut corners and present quite a shallow view of what pop music is capable of. I also believe that there isn’t necessarily anything about a standard orchestra, chamber ensemble or choir which renders it unable to represent contemporary culture and society. Composers, who understand the particularities of ‘classical’ instruments and the possibilities of notated harmonic and tonal structures, should be looking for new roles for their particular tools. There is no crisis in the future of guitar music or dance music, it is the classical ensembles which need to be re-assessed.

In addition, composers could expand their palette of influences by looking, not only at industrial pop music as an art-form, but also at other vernacular instances of music in society. This could include video game and film music, the sounds of technology (computers and machinery, PA systems and mobile phones), TV theme-tunes and advertising jingles, sports chants, sirens and ice-cream vans, elevator music, karaoke, etc.

ii. Contemporary values and concerns

Classical music has long maintained (and enjoyed) a reputation as a conservative, cerebral, ‘spiritual’ art-form. Its dependence on the re-performance of ancient works, along with a desire to preserve them in their original state, has fostered an obsession with universality, timelessness and the pursuit of transcendence. Even in new music,  which in practice invariably has a shelf-life much shorter than any pop song, this obsession feeds a focus on academic, scientific or philosophical concern with the material of sound, non-specific meditations on the nature of humanity, and a chronic desire to communicate with the past (as well as a totally unique tolerance for organised religion). These are obsessions which are shared by some factions of most other art-form. However, there are many, many other values and concerns to explore artistically, especially in our age of cultural relativism. That these particular concerns have completely dominated music since modernism has been one of the key reasons why classical music has alienated itself from the progressive trends of other artistic fields. It is likely that old music, obsessed with the same arbitrary values, will always continue to be performed, and re-written, in the big institutions. In order to fill the huge gap which remains, I would advocate a focus on all those concerns and values that composers have largely ignored by rote, many of them the polar opposites of those values listed earlier in this document. These should include:

immediacy +++++ insubstantiality +++++ fashion

comedy/levity +++++ cheapness +++++ shallowness

sex +++++ violence +++++ drugs

specificity (of events, people, places, ideas, zeitgeist) +++++ politics/satire

youth/young people +++++ race/sexuality +++++ subcultures

irony +++++ popular culture/technology +++++ mass-media

the everyday +++++ autobiography +++++ celebrity

coolness/trendiness +++++ music for a specific audience/group/event

modern artistic genres +++++ extremes/shock/sensationalism

Many fans of classical music would protest here that there is music about sex and about politics; they could probably pick out an Italian opera to fit all of these concerns. But however much they might protest, it simply isn’t the same. Restaging a two-hundred-year-old piece about celebrity in a modern production is not the same as a new piece that explicitly engages with real situations in our place and time. It’s just a lazy alternative. One might say that this piece or that piece is ‘clearly all about sex’, but this isn’t the 1890s, and ‘clearly’ nowadays actually means clearly. New music needs to take one big and uncompromising step into real postmodernism if it is even going to begin to catch up with the rest of art. There is no reason that the sound of a guitar band should be essentially more sexual or more youthful than a chamber group. The only fear is of explicitly pursuing values or ideas which are not considered by classical traditions and institutions as the ‘right’ ones for this kind of music.

iii. Intelligibility and accessibility

Accessibility means, primarily, not expecting specialist knowledge from an audience. This includes knowledge of music theory, common classical structures and tropes, having a ‘trained ear’, familiarity with past repertoire, or even an unreasonable knowledge of ancient history or foreign languages. Not only should everything be presented in clear, audible English, but there should be a shift away from formal language, the predilection towards archaic-sounding poetry, the use of Italian or Latin titles, and anything else which is essentially just wilful alienation.

The principle to be adopted here is in not relying upon a departure from an established point in music history – past or even present – when beginning to compose a piece. In order to fully open classical music up to non-musicians, a familiarity with other contemporary or recent composers cannot be expected, nor can a reliance on established classical genre. Music with meaning that relies on such knowledge will never be truly accessible. Instead, accessibility can be aided by departing from a recognised point outside of music history, such as a political event or idea, an artwork in another field, or even a personal experience – what traditional music enthusiasts might consider ‘a programme’. The use of words will always immediately assist potential audiences, because they provide a meaning which is necessarily distinct from the substance of the music itself. Vocals are also a very important part of popular music, and the vocalist as ‘performer-character’ can provide a useful entry-point into a piece.

Pieces should also be on a manageable scale for contemporary art consumption. Independent pop fans will frequently listen to hour-long albums in one sitting, and attend live shows which might last two hours or more. However, they are used to a variety of structural divisions within that space of time, and composers need to learn to value and utilise such small-scale structures, rather than treat them with suspicion. The more classical music’s ‘supporters’ bemoan the short attention spans of younger listeners, the more they deny their music any contemporary value. Composers need to acknowledge the ubiquity of listening modes that have been shaped by pop and technology, and they must make use of these without feeling guilty at somehow betraying the imagined values of their former institutions.

The final point to make in this area is that, in order to properly find its place in a serious artistic culture, classical music has to relinquish its desire to be universal. Composers are concerned with maximising the performance opportunities of any one piece, and they commonly demonstrate this by watering it down so that it will fit as many occasions and audiences as possible. This is, in reality, an efficient way of removing any real relevance or meaning from an artwork. The new musical movement, as I’ve said before, should be targeted at young, culture-savvy people. Classical music should not be family-friendly. If it is written for children then that’s a different matter, but it’s not going to resonate in society if it’s child-oriented. Composers must be comfortable with the idea of writing for adults, and not for potentially squeamish, nostalgic or conservative elderly people either, but for socially-powerful, culture-making, intelligent, artistically-curious (but non-musical), real-life young adults.

iv. Cross-disciplinary inspiration and collaboration

I’ve mentioned the importance of a new movement in allowing art music to re-join the other important contemporary art-forms at the cutting edge of culture, and I mean this in terms of shared or mutually-explored philosophical, aesthetic and socio-political currents of thought. The most obvious way to achieve this is simply to communicate with them directly, through an exchange of ideas and practical collaboration. New composers should be using artworks in other media as departure points in their own field. Musical works could attempt to ‘describe’ or ‘represent’ specific artworks, such as paintings or novels, or they could aim to find equivalent gestures, processes and aesthetics within their own language. Composers should be looking to artistic movements, genres and traditions in other fields, which might have materialised since the 1960s, and attempting to find musical equivalents for their key ideas. Just the knowledge of this kind of exchange of inspiration would be enough to open such pieces up to non-musicians familiar with these other artworks or traditions.

Collaboration and multi-media work would also be very important in bringing a new musical movement into line with the rest of art. The addition of theatre to music instantly elucidates several layers of meaning to non-musicians, while permitting the explicit exploration of those contemporary themes and subjects listed above. Musical theatre and opera have always maintained a privileged position within new music, but by separating itself from its archaic and limiting ‘musical’ institutions, rather than the possibilities of its adjacent ‘theatrical’ institutions, opera could immediately become the most accessible and important genre of classical music. New opera should be conscious of every new progression that has happened in theatre in the last hundred years, just as new vocal writing should aspire to engage with the work of living poets, and new poetry, rather than constantly revisiting old writing. Composers should be aware of the state of contemporary dance and write music that engages with it, rather than letting choreographers choose their own music to suit. Composers should be finding ways to ‘use’ film-makers, theatre directors and even video-game technology in the way that these disciplines will readily ‘use’ music. And throughout all this, the music should acknowledge its own importance and it should be prepared to lead these other disciplines and inspire real artistic dialogue.

5. Other Solutions

i. The composer-personality

Classical music should be concerning itself with how to become a functional, media-friendly industry. The art-form has had a complicated and deeply confused relationship with the idea of a ‘music industry’. The funding that the big institutions receive from government and council organisations suggest that, ideally, classical music should be above commercialism. At the same time though, the same institutions, as well as the record labels, will go straight to the lowest-common denominator when it’s time to actually make money, and employ some very cynical and exploitative solutions. There is a kind of double culture at work, in which it is accepted that classical music is above industrialised society while at the same time, needing money, it doesn’t mind selling out in the most extreme ways to fund this illusion of absolute transcendence. This is an approach that needs to be completely overhauled.

As a niche art-form, new music should be looking at other ways in which niche artistic cultures support themselves while maintaining a staunchly uncommercialised, creatively-free identity. It should in particular be looking to non-mainstream pop music which, while by no means pandering to the mainstream or compromising any kind of artistic freedom, does use branding, marketing and the media relentlessly in order to attract its audience. This process is infinitely subtle for alternative pop, and involves conscious image cultivation in every photograph, interview, website design, album inlay and live show. The same kind of image management is important for niche artists, film directors and authors, but it must be recalled that art music is a type of presented performance art and that this renders such considerations all the more important.

Classical composers seem to put quite a lot of effort into giving off the impression of being ‘serious’, by being ‘above’ all popular culture and fashion (thereby protecting their music from any such ‘undesirable’ attachments), while simultaneously detaching themselves from their work enough to make the music seem to stand on its own (thereby achieve the ‘timeless and universal’ properties that could potentially make it ‘great’). All this contributes to is a particularly pointless fallacy, and an attitude which is not only condescending to society at large, but is actually condescending to their own existing audiences. It is meant to suggest a lack of egotism, but is in fact far more egotistical an outlook than that of pop artists, since it stems from a belief that ‘their’ art is essentially higher than any art-form which engages positively with the actualities of contemporary values and society. What’s more, in practice, alternative pop musicians attach no less value to coming across as ‘seriously’ as modern composers do. The only difference is that, in publicity, pop musicians are prepared to represent their music as such, whilst composers are so against reinforcing their music with any personal ‘image’ that they come across as uninterested and irrelevant.

What I would very seriously advocate is the swift formulation of the classical ‘composer-personality’, in which composers take full responsibility of representing their own music: in the way they come across in photos and interviews, in the way they dress, in brand consistency (which could involve collaboration with fellow artists, web designers or film-makers), and in a full-on embrace of the idea of an artistic ‘image’ and media personality. Furthermore, composers should endeavour to take on the role of ‘composer-performer-personality’. The immense appeal of pop music relies heavily on the fact that the music which is being performed or communicated onstage or on recordings is coming directly from the composer themselves. This is what enables such important qualities as specificity and immediacy. If only by conducting their own work, composers should learn not to value the detachment which has always been a possibility of classical music – to no longer be ‘humble’ and ‘let the music speak for itself’. This needn’t entail massive egotism; it is very common for pop acts to take on identities distinct from themselves as people – invented band and artist names have just such a value, while record labels as collectives serve a similar purpose. Whether or not the composer is using themselves personally or a constructed identity, such a focus is totally invaluable in modern culture, and needn’t be in any way in opposition to what classical music ‘essentially’ entails.

As an extension of this, composers should be associating themselves with specific ensembles and retaining a visual presence within these. Thereby, even if they don’t perform themselves, composers could still develop a performing presence which would simultaneously function as part of their brand identity. They should be presenting or compèring concerts and touring with these ensembles, maintaining an absolutely central position onstage. The disconnection between composer and performer, which has previously been valued by classical initiates – simply because, for a long time, that’s just how it’s been – is totally alien to pop music audiences, as well as to many artistic traditions, and there is no real reason why it should be thus. By taking such new structures as foundations for a new art music movement, the culture can be grown up again along very different lines, but not ones that in any way affect the substance of the music itself.

Of course, composers aren’t the only ones who can cultivate media identities and manage personal brands. The last few years have seen a significant number of performers who are (in general, quite unimaginatively) marketed through a brand image, although this has uniformly been to an audience of middle-aged to elderly people (even if that wasn’t the initial intention). Many classical fans would say that such image-conscious performers are covering up a lack of talent, or even that such a visual focus can obscure the more important factor of musical ability. The main problem, I would argue, is that the kind of image normally being marketed is one of bland, non-threatening prettiness, an image which is usually reflected in the narrow choice of repertoire for such ‘cross-over’ artists. It is an image which is cynically aimed at maximising an audience by being as non-committal and unremarkable as possible – shooting for the centre of the mainstream – but unfortunately it is also perceived as the only branding possibility in this double-current of an all-or-nothing (totally uncommercial or total ‘sell-out’) culture.

In independent pop music, an appealing, charismatic, intriguing and original image is typically cultivated in conjunction with remarkable and original talent in the production of meaningful art. Fundamentally, this could just mean performers ‘making an effort’. Even now, it is generally accepted that, in concerts, soloists will endeavour to come across as pleasant-looking, well-dressed, even attractive. Attention to  physical appearance is not an alien concern to classical institutions. There is no reason why being physically attractive as a musical performer should be any less a positive quality than as an actor. What musical performers must learn to do is to drop the formality, the prescribed uniforms or dress ‘rules’, and be comfortable with coming across as individuals, even as young or fashionable individuals, whose originality as performers might conceivably be linked to an originality as people, without devaluing it. This might mean coming across as an eccentric ‘character’, or it might mean coming across as a real, everyday person, but either of these is instantly more accessible than that special brand of butlers, duchesses and diplomats that characterises the costume of most classical performers. (And that means not just onstage but in publicity shots, in which the same insanely glamourous headshots, or completely inexplicable and embarrassing poses with instruments, represent a long and misjudged tradition of awkward underselling.)

ii. Politics and religion

The contemporary awkwardness of stage uniforms and common publicity poses links into a deeper problem with classical music, which again has a lot to do with the age and background of its institutional leaders and target audience: the representation of gender. It is unfortunate that the biological differences which distinguish women from men are a crucial factor in the composition of a mixed voice choir, as well as the delineation of different operatic voices, because the continuing impact of this has left classical music as one of the most oppressively unenlightened cultures in the western world. The chauvinism of gender-defined formal dress, which is still the most prevalent uniform in the classical world, has locked performers of both genders into very narrow roles. The objectification of women is still very evident in the kind of outfits that soloists, especially singers, choose to wear, when compared to the ‘seriousness’ of male outfits. The lack of female conductors in every area of classical music is totally abhorrent and will instantly alienate a vast proportion of enlightened, artistic society. The constant re-performance of often misogynistic opera plots which almost always rely on gender binaries and stereotypes to support their musical narratives is equally problematic. The sexism inherent in existing classical traditions is just as dangerous as its apparent classism, and no art-form can hope to be truly avant-garde or progressive in our society while maintaining such unquestioned, deeply right-wing values. This is another reason why there needs to be an absolute break from the establishment before the majority of intelligent non-musicians will begin to take the art-form seriously.

Classical music is also distinct from every other art-form in that it maintains an unquestioned alliance with organised religion. The church is one of the institutions’ biggest patrons, and most renowned composers, even atheist ones, are fully prepared to write music for worship, while pretty much all choirs accept that the majority of their repertoire must by necessity be religious in subject. In a society in which religion (especially Christianity) is often viewed with anything between derision, antipathy or utter disinterest by many of its progressive artistic factions (and certainly by the young population at large), it is very dangerous for the classical institutions to put such reliance on the church, and the notion that their art is inheritantly ‘spiritual’. In order for choral music in particular to stay healthy, it needs to learn to function without religious support and to address other issues and audiences. Non-religious composers should not be accepting commissions from churches to write explicitly religious music, because it is lazy and un-creative on their part, and it is selling out in the most real sense of the concept, while seeming to advocate a culture in which such artistic insincerity is totally permissable (or even unavoidable). The inclusion of explicit religious material in a concert programme is very alienating to large areas of society, but it also damages the perception of classical music as a whole, suggesting a reliance once again on archaic, right-wing institutions. While classical music continues to be linked to religion at an institutional level, it will never be allowed to properly re-engage with other cutting-edge artistic cultures.

iii. A new approach to recordings

Currently, there is an idea that one of the distinctions between classical music and pop music is that classical music is ‘essentially’ a live art while pop is ‘essentially’ a recorded art. This is another essentialist assumption which stems from the fact that classical music happens to exist in scores so it can practically be re-performed. It has nothing to do with the music itself, nor how it is consumed in real life; obviously, both live and recorded music are very important in both cultures. However, classical music’s learned reluctance to validate itself as a ‘recorded’ art-form has prevented it from properly making use of the record industry as it currently exists. Therefore, classical music cannot be ‘used’ culturally in any of the multifarious and deeply complex ways that pop music is. Classical composers seem to be more satisfied with having their fruits of labour performed in a one-off, under-publicised and under-attended concert than to be recorded in a ‘definitive’ form which could nevertheless be distributed and mechanically re-performed an infinite number of times.

Along with the idea that music can be connected to a specific personality – its composer – and a specific performing ensemble, there is no reason that this idea of a definitive recorded version cannot be introduced to classical music. In pop, it has hardly stopped music from being re-performed and re-interpreted live, or from being covered by other artists (often in versions far more various, and subject to more extensive creative manipulation, than in the re-performance of notated pieces between similarly-proportioned orchestras). Composers should be embracing the idea of releasing albums; this would instantly make them more comprehensible to modern audiences as brands. The lack of a tangible material output has long been a problem for potential art fans wanting to build up a knowledge of art music. Having accessible, re-playable versions of modern music, which can be explored outside of expensive live occasions, can make potentially ‘difficult’ new music much more manageable. Such albums, marketed properly and given publicity in the right media, could also generate real excitement around live shows performed by composer-personalities and their ensembles, the equivalent of ‘promotional tours’ in pop music. There is a very particular role for tangible, ‘ownable’, material art in popular culture, in an age of individual and group identity creation through artistic appropriation. Any idea that this is somehow a ‘bad’ use of art would be nothing but an elitist prejudice based on the traditional assumptions of the classical institutions.

By producing albums (and singles) which follow exactly the same format as alternative pop music, and can be produced by independent labels which are run in the same way as their pop equivalents (or even shared by existing labels), new art music could fit into a very highly developed, and constantly evolving, pre-existing framework for the successful dissemination of obscure music to audiences worldwide. There is no reason why all the accompanying trappings of pop albums – cover art and catchy titles, press releases, leaked tracks, and calculated media campaigns of feeding and withholding information – should be exempt from the new art music culture. But most excitingly, by letting go of the traditional mistrust of the idea of any kind of ‘definitive’ version, or a genuine recorded music culture, art music could truly open itself up to the creative possibilities of the recording studio: production techniques, transformative electronic processes, and the relinquishing of an arbitrary pursuit of studio ‘realism’ or ‘verisimilitude’ for a genuine interest in innovative sound engineering.

Finally, the acceptance of definitive recorded works and the growth of a commercial album-producing industry might potentially alleviate one of the other big problems which stands in the way of art music, especially new music. This is the reliance that modern composers have on fees for performance rights, which often forces amateur and independent ensembles to play old, public domain works rather than pay for newer music. This system is so ridiculously counterproductive to the spread and significance of new music that any way to somehow replace it would have a revolutionary effect on the way that performing ensembles approach contemporary composition.

iv. A new live format

I have already talked about the negative political connotations of concert attire, but this problem obviously goes a lot further than sexism. In order for a new musical movement to really welcome a new audience of non-musicians, every extant aspect of concert ritual must be completely replaced. There are very few aspects of ‘traditional’ classical performance that, questioned without bigotry, would be accepted as fundamental to the presentation of art music as it essentially exists. The majority of these are customs which have been adopted through habit or lack of imagination, or the elitist pleasures of shared ritual. Many of them reflect a totally outmoded pretense towards aristocracy or ‘high’ culture. These customs have frequently been identified as a key reason why non-musicians are put off from even attempting to listen to art music.

The first move in the transformation of the classical concert should be to totally de-institutionalise it. This would mean focusing on alternative venues, not necessarily even concert halls but small clubs, bars, pubs, small theatres, halls, anywhere free from traditionalist connotation. Using venues normally used for pop gigs would further constitute a gesture of reconciliation to these alienated audiences, while innovative and unusual venues would encourage site-specific creativity while suggesting boundary-breaking novelty. The scale on which institutional classical music currently functions is quite problematic. The financial reliance on familiar orchestral, large-scale choral, and grand operatic works would seem to require the use of large venues, which then have to be filled. For an art-form in massive decline, it is impossible to continue trying to work on such a scale. There must necessarily be more of a focus on chamber music and vocal music, and music for smaller orchestras, choirs, or utilising electronics. This, in turn, would be less expensive, and require smaller audiences (so less artistic compromise) and cheaper tickets (so a younger, or less ‘upper-class’ demographic).

A smaller-scale music culture, one that can function ‘underground’, could also mark a return to performable small-scale amateur works – the best way to get modern music actually performed in a society where most of the music-making is being done at an educational level. However, while academies and universities will obviously continue to be important in teaching skills to composers and performers, there should also be an attempt to move music away from these places, and take some of the emphasis off ‘academic’ or ‘cerebral’ qualities, which pigeon-hole classical music into a very restrictive mode.

Otherwise, the classical concert should attempt to come into line with the popular concert. This doesn’t mean a rowdy audience making noise throughout; in contrast to the preconceptions of some classical purists, this is by no means what small pop concerts involve. However, there should be a move away from formality for its own sake, including a total ban on traditional formal clothing for performers. There should be a lot more exchange between audience and performers, including introductions by the performers or composers to all the pieces. Amplification of all instruments should become near-standard, depending on the layout of the venue. The idea that the amplification of an ensemble will always impact the sound quality negatively is, of course, a completely ignorant one, motivated only by an aversion to pop music culture. It would allow the audience to relax more, to maybe even stand or move around during the performance, or purchase refreshments, without impacting the enjoyment of other audience members, which is one of its key purposes in pop concerts. With a relaxation of formality, concerts could also be more inventive in their layout, rather than always following a prescribed, published programme.

Another aspect that the classical concert should aim to emulate from the pop concert is the necessity of an awareness of visual and theatrical, not just aural, presentation. Putting some effort into lighting and stage layout (and even set, costume, and projected images or accompanying film) shouldn’t just be a novel extra – it should be a fundamental aspect of presenting a live show. This doesn’t necessarily mean extravagance, it just means an awareness of some non-musical dimension. Theatricality is a fundamental part of performance in pop music, and it should be just as important to classical music, seamlessly and creatively integrated with the substance of the music, not just in so-called ‘music theatre’ but in any kind of performance. There is an idea that such elements in some way ‘distract’ from the music as it should be heard, but the truth is that what really distracts is an absence of theatrical consideration, and that such elements should be used to enhance musical performance as the multi-sensory experience that it necessarily is.

(All this applies equally to opera, of course, which is just as guilty of endearing to arbitrary traditions, often with more damaging results. An opera that is as liberated and creative as modern studio theatre, which can experiment with integrating sung music into everything that intimate theatre is now capable of, should be fighting to escape the often ridiculous confines of the opera house.)

v. Online presence

Perhaps the first step for a new classical movement must be to fully embrace the potential of the internet. While most of the big institutions have made (largely unconvincing) nods towards current technological trends, we should be looking to build a culture that is properly based on the internet. Composers and performers need well-designed, attractive and functional websites, but more than that, they need to cultivate a presence online, most importantly through their music. The internet is now the primary way in which new musicians are encountered and explored by fans in independent pop culture, and in addition to having a memorable brand identity, this will only happen for classical artists if they learn to produce definitive versions of their own music which can be distributed in a digital form, downloaded, shared and discussed on web-based music hubs. Once classical musicians come to terms with the idea that their work could potentially exist in recorded form, there is no reason why art music couldn’t develop a very healthy and culturally-relevant online community, which would in turn promote live concert tours internationally.

There are millions of music fans who make it their personal mission to discover and pass on obscure new music on a daily basis. What’s more, there are a number of very powerful music sites whose main purpose is to propel unknown music to new audiences. Such is the power of the blogosphere, and the only reason that classical music isn’t making full use of this is that it has tried so hard to alienate anyone who might be interested in doing so, by proudly staking out its imagined differences. At the same time, most of the ‘traditional’ media is now largely based online anyway; any artist needs to learn how to present themselves online, but this is especially true of those involved in an art-form which can (and should) actually be consumed online. In this way, classical music is actually better placed than fiction or theatre in a web-based society, and it should be doing everything to optimise its use of these tools.

vi. Innovation and creativity

Once musicians properly adopt an optimistic, unprejudiced attitude towards finding a new and relevant place in modern society, there’s no end to the kind of experiments that are possible. They have to begin with actively seeking alternatives to alienating and traditionalist habits, and not settling for compromise. A few examples could easily be discussed just by looking at the kind of developments that have occurred in pop music and challenging art music to find equivalents:

Music videos – an official promotional collaboration with a film-maker to create a multi-media object from a new composition, which can be viewed and shared on the internet. This would be very effective in opening up new music to non-musicians.
Covers/remixes – re-composed versions of other classical music, or music from different genres, in original arrangements, or ‘sampled’ and manipulated to create new meanings. Classical pieces could also be remixed by electronic artists or pop musicians, and even made to function as dance music. This symbiotic exchange of musical ideas, especially across genres, could lead to joint concerts, joint releases and guest appearances.
Support slots – giving composer-performers a slot supporting alternative pop artists, or even the other way around, would instantly expose this music to a new audience in their own context and on their own terms. Equally, if composers were perceived more as personalities, they could use comparable systems of support to expose each other to larger audiences at their own shows.
Touring – this concept, already occurring in some small areas of classical music culture, could be vastly extended. Composer-performers and their ensembles should aim to produce portable shows which can fit a number of different venues, and use this series of shows to generate interest over time, through reviews in the media and (online) ‘word-of-mouth’.
The long-term goal for this movement should be to establish new systems into which older repertoire can be re-introduced. In that way, older music can reach new audiences without anything getting in the way. However, musicians should only perform what is appropriate, they shouldn’t feel the need to perform a piece because it is objectively ‘great’ or because people ‘should’ appreciate it. The repertoire should be chosen, and adapted, to the new performance circumstances. Above all, the idea that there is a particular way to perform a particular piece should be totally alien to this new way of thinking. Everything should be fluid in this new movement, and pieces should be adapted as necessary to be the most effective that they can be in the immediate circumstances, even if it means making abridgements, cutting parts, re-scoring, adding bits, adding multimedia elements, completely ignoring performance markings, etc. The idea that a piece should be performed with historic authenticity is not a creative artistic outlook, and it separates classical music from the rest of the arts. Taking an absolutely unbiased and original approach to older music should encourage bold creative decisions on the part of performers and help find new  contemporary purposes and meanings in what are potentially archaic art-works.

Conclusion: a few closing statements

i. Populism needn’t be reactionary

It also needn’t be cynical. What the classical music community desperately needs is a consensus that, contrary to the beliefs of some, it doesn’t know better than the society for which it is providing. It has been shown time and time again that classical music is no more ‘moral’ than other musics. In fact, if anything, it is less moral, because it rarely shows any kind of social conscience or political interest, and values tradition and religious prescription over contemporary secular ethics or common altruism. Pop music, and a lot of other contemporary art, will commonly take active steps towards the improvement of society, whilst classical music continues in its belief that it is ‘improving’ in its very essence, and need therefore take no further responsibility. But the situation has deteriorated much further than that, and new music has reached a point where it isn’t even attempting to interest most classical music fans, let alone the rest of society. The belief that it is too ‘progressive’ is an essentially problematic one for obvious reasons, but its prevalence goes hand-in-hand with the idea that, if non-musicians like or ‘get’ your music, you’ve somehow moved backwards. The new musical movement should be an uncynical populist movement, and one that believes in people who want to hear their world expressed and interpreted by music. It will need to be optimistic, because so much of classical populism expects the worst in people, and it will have to avoid aiming right for the mainstream.

The best historical model for such a movement would, of course, be the new populist movement that occurred in the 1920s, in Weimar Germany and Paris amongst other places, which was characterised by an engagement with popular music, with explicit left-wing politics, and with everyday society. It aimed to be accessible and intelligible, and to pivot upon the constant production of new relevant works. From our contemporary position, looking back into a musical history obsessed with the ‘endurance’ of pieces and the formation of canons, many of the new operas which were wildly popular in the early decades of the twentieth century, but have not ‘endured’ in our current repertoire, are viewed somehow as ‘failures’. But compare the fate of these to the new works that have appeared very occasionally in recent seasons at the big opera houses and festivals, more often than not doomed to almost instant obscurity. We should be fostering a culture that produces these works, hypes them up to the highest possible level, milks them for everything they’re worth, and then doesn’t care if they’re never performed again after two years or so. We teach people to imagine that such works cannot be ‘great’ because they haven’t been revived a thousand times since their premiere in the 18th century (and that in turn might be because they don’t represent the ‘universal’ themes of misogyny, patriarchy, heteronormativity and sadomasochistic religious fundamentalism) and so people think they’re not worth going to see. If our musical culture was really functioning, no-one would care in thirty years’ time what the ‘great’ works were from our decade because they’d have so many exciting new works to perform. Weimar populism, which was definitely by no means reactionary, is sometimes deemed to have ‘failed’, not just because the German music scene collapsed under the Nazis, but also because many of the key composers, including Krenek and Hindemith, went on to denounce their more populist works, statements and intentions. But this is only because they were just as institutionalised as we are and deep down they couldn’t help but believe that classical music should represent all those assumed values which seem to be at odds with a real populist agenda.

Too often, and very sadly, this is still proved to be the case. As composers get older – perhaps as they become more famous – they feel the egotistical draw of the classical myth and they want to join the pantheon. Even young composers with populist tendencies will very often deny any kind of ‘compromise’ of values; instead they will argue lamely, and ascribe their fascinating and interesting music with false intentions, while masking the real, if ‘unwanted’, qualities that mark them out. And for many, I’m sure, there doesn’t seem to be any other option, because a large proportion of professional musicians are absolutely surrounded by fellow musicians. There is very little contact with any kind of outside world, so any such dialogue invoking non-traditional values would be held in confusion or derision.

There’s so much instant gratification to be had from existing within a small circle of initiates, as well as amongst apparently well-trodden career paths and networks in which to climb. The truth is, though, that this is just a relic of dire necessity. To many musicians, classical music seems contained within a simple, streamlined world. But that’s just because it’s a very small world, and a very unoriginal one.

ii. Mainstream classical music doesn’t need protecting

Older classical fans will often express the belief that they need to ‘protect’ the traditions and repertoires of the classical mainstream, a mission which apparently involves regular performances of canonical pieces ‘the way they should be performed’. Such an attitude is not in danger of disappearing any time soon. It is an enduring feature of human nature to enjoy consistency and repetition, and just as the British monarchy have become too non-threatening and irrelevant an institution to dispose of totally, so too has classical music. The classical canon, as it has been preserved in the height of the age of recording, has little to fear. This is not an advocation to overthrow the classical mainstream so much as it is one to ignore it. Sure, it is important to alienate the kind of people that rely on classical music for these qualities; if a show aiming to target a new audience were overrun by traditionalist musicians or elderly people, the new audience would still feel alienated itself. But the pieces that are popular with this demographic will continue to be popular, and if there are other old pieces that are seemingly being neglected, and there is still an argument that such historical curiosities need to be ‘protected’ through re-performance, I would question whether they were ever at all ‘universal’ or ‘timeless’ in the first place. Any older pieces with genuine contemporary relevance, and which can be put to good use in modern and accessible performances, are of course open to appropriation by the new musical movement.

In the same way, traditional music’s role in pedagogy or as an amateur community activity needn’t be affected, although the teaching of music history could afford to be less prescriptive, especially when it comes to defining genre delineations. But these are only minor functions in what should be a much bigger culture, just as school art lessons and community life-drawing classes could hardly make up for an absence of new original exhibitions. What needs to be protected is not old pieces or traditional practices, but orchestral, chamber, vocal and choral music itself: its very identity as a living, relevant art-form.

iii. Pop music itself is in great shape

It is in such great shape, in fact, that it is perfectly effectively and enthusiastically filling all the gaps in society that classical music has chosen to leave. It continues to move forward with new original steps, while maintaining a large listenership, and it is making use of modern media channels and technologies as they emerge, in a most creative fashion. Pop music does not need to connect with art music, although, in opening up pop musicians to previously barricaded soundworlds, structures and processes, such a connection would no doubt continue to inspire and inform pop music at its most experimental. Art music however does, I believe, need to connect with pop music, and most specifically its audiences, in order to survive. It needn’t become pop music; in fact, it must endeavour not to. Composers should strive to continue to use all the technical effects, ensemble combinations and rhetorical devices that they have developed since music was first written for ‘classical’ instruments. In essence, this is really a challenge to composers to learn to truly use classical music’s materials without resorting to alienating prototypes or obfuscating principles, or arbitrary topics. It is a challenge to produce some truly original new art music, which aspires to purposes that art music has never before aspired to. And yet it is not a difficult challenge, because this new music should be so totally distinct from the accepted models of classical music that its very engagement with these new ideas, problems and principles should automatically require innovative thought.

It should be acknowledged, at this point, that there has been a fair amount of music written recently which aspires to be ‘genre-less’ – neither pop, classical nor, indeed, jazz, but (usually) somewhere in between. This kind of approach, an attempt to cut off all associations and start from a completely new position, would in theory seem to be a positive one. For some, it may indeed be a solution to many of the problems outlined at the beginning of this document. However, there are often issues with music that declares itself ‘genre-less’, or even ‘beyond’ or ‘above’ genre. Firstly, it is necessarily non-committal. By presenting itself as unique, it exempts itself from responsibility in the kind of agenda that I’m putting forward here, and might even deny the existence of problems within particular cultures, instead situating itself at a point outside of any tradition or culture. In calling itself unique and unclassifiable, it also cannot attempt to aim at any existing audience or fulfill any existing function. It cannot present itself as a possible compositional direction for students of either pop or classical traditions, even if it is perceived as such.

Moreover, though, the desire to come across as ‘genre-less’ often demonstrates a kind of absolutism that is built on an aversion to the idea of genre-as-socio-political-connotation. Most of this ‘genre-less’ music essentially uses the materials of pop music, often a small step away from prog- or post-rock, but aspires to the kind of absolute, unworldly values that classical music claims – a kind of ‘high’ pop. It covets many of those arbitrary connotations of art music which I have extensively criticised, and this often leads to a pop music with a distinct lack of ‘edge’, maintaining its structures and instrumentation but relinquishing its pointedness. A pop music that aspires to ‘classicism’ is necessarily very different to a classical music that aspires to populism. In order to truly experiment with the capabilities of classical ensembles, composers should avoid falling into ‘genre-free’ holes which mask their own narrow assumptions of the moods, themes and subjects which classical music can ‘naturally’ express.

iv. Music is not for musicians

Such an artistic reform must eventually be both extreme and absolute. What it mainly requires is long-term vision and optimism. Art music could be so much more than it is (it has been before, and I don’t really believe that many musicians would hesitate to agree). It could also quite happily continue in the form that it has currently taken, and continue to serve a very small purpose in society. For most people who are already musicians (and are equipped to make the necessary changes), this would seem to be the safest, most comfortable path. In my opinion, it is also an irresponsible one, both for society as a whole, and for the future of the music itself.

Initially, new developments may have to come from within the institutions. As I have mentioned before, many of the ideas that I have listed are not original – they may have been implemented on their own or together in a few cases by a few artists, to varying effect (a lot could be learned, for example, from Iceland’s Bedroom Community label, New York’s New Amsterdam Records and London’s Nonclassical amongst others). There is a danger, however, that apparent steps towards inclusion and populism may seem far greater than they really are, just as – in such a staunchly conservative musical culture – small creative decisions can be received as ‘ground-breaking’ or ‘incendiary’.

Eventually, in order to really achieve its goals, this movement will need to believe in the power and possibility of real independence from institutional support. It will have to start out small, but by following pre-existent structures in other artistic domains, especially pop music, it could quite quickly grow into a real cultural trend and, by provoking interest and demonstrating possibilities, it shouldn’t be hard to empower independent individuals or groups of musicians to attempt their own projects. With enough determination, such a trend could go on to inspire the musical institutions with enough confidence and specific guidance to effect similar changes themselves. There’s no harm in idealism where art is concerned. But it is up to the musicians to take the first steps.

towards a new classical music culture

a manifesto

[bite-size version]

Classical music has allowed itself to occupy a smaller and smaller space in contemporary culture, to the extent that nowadays most people – even those interested in other cutting-edge art-forms – don’t know or care to know anything about it.

1. problems

i. lack of presence and relevance as a living art-form – Pop music has filled pretty much all the roles that classical music used to aspire to in functioning as a musical art-form that reflects and comments upon modern society and engages with the contemporary cultural moment.

ii. aesthetic preoccupations – Classical musicians have come to regard their own art as necessarily and ‘essentially’ aspiring to, and capable of, a number of arbitrarily-assigned aesthetics and value systems which are both anachronistic and dangerously limiting.

iii. alienation of the young – Thanks largely to these value systems, and the archaic models that have become normalised as ‘the way classical music functions’, the entire artistic tradition has (often purposefully) constructed itself in opposition to the kind of values and aesthetic emphases that appeal to younger people. One of the key problems here is its massive, shameless emphasis on the reperformance of old works at the expense of new creation.

iv. music for musicians – One of the most dangerously enduring myths, which has long ago penetrated to the heart of every musical institution, is that it’s OK to write, present or market music largely to other people with a specialist practical understanding of music, and that the only way to interest a potential audience in classical music is to turn them into musicians.

Classical music has for a long time sought to distinguish itself from pop music, not just in terms of musical structures but in terms of socio-cultural connotations, modes of dissemination, aesthetic trends, etc. Since pop music quite naturally evolves with the changing contours of modern society, this has meant that classical music has ended up purposefully distinguishing itself from modern society and culture.

2. overall aims

i. separatism – In order to fully shed the assumptions and connotations deeply ingrained in classical music culture, a new musical movement should be based entirely outside of the big institutions.

ii. new alignments – In order to quickly bring itself into line with other more socially and culturally engaged art-forms, new classical music should align itself to, collaborate with and take inspiration from other cutting-edge artistic traditions, more general modern artistic trends, and youth and popular cultures – especially that of pop music.

iii. new audience – New classical music has its most immediate potential audience in the fans of niche independent pop music, hungry for new sounds, impervious to experimental complexity and dissonance, but as yet alienated by irrelevant connotations and rituals.

iv. new materialism – In order to quickly counteract the damage caused by the narrowing of classical music’s aesthetic horizons, composers and musicians should embrace a ‘New Materialism’, looking to construct a self-replacing, constantly renewing culture of music for the present, rather than a fixation with the past (or, in fact, the future) and the chimeras of ‘timelessness’ and ‘universality’.

3. compositional solutions

i. engagement with pop music – Bearing in mind how few the essential differences actually are between classical and pop music (structural development, timbral combinations, recognisable tropes, harmonic gestures etc.), composers can afford to try and recreate some of the particular moods and effects of pop, as well as its processes, devices and presentational structures, which are in no way inaccessible to classical ensembles, just deemed ‘inappropriate’ by its previous value systems. Composers should take on the challenge of maintaining the instrumental/vocal forces standardised throughout the 20th century, and working with the kinds of harmonic and textural languages developed, but using these to new ends in order to access new, culturally-contemporary aesthetics and concerns.

ii. contemporary values and concerns – For a new musical movement to have its most powerful effect, these should be in stark contrast to the kind of values and concerns deemed ‘essential’ to traditional classical music. Examples include ‘immediacy’, ‘specificity’, ‘disposability’ and ‘fashionableness’.

iii. intelligibility and accessibility – It is impermissible for a work to be wilfully unintelligible. Music should make an effort towards accessibility, including the use of vernacular language and reasonable durations, and by avoiding any required familiarity with technical rules, jargon, musical history or other specialist knowledge in order to appreciate a piece.
iv. cross-disciplinary inspiration and collaboration – The combination of different media can create very useful entry points to new audiences, while allowing more developed parallel art-forms to provide a launching point for musical works, drawing on their own audiences and meanings.
other solutions

i. the composer-personality – Rather than fetishising the distance between composer and music, a ‘composer-performer-personality’ should become standard, along with the development of a media image and the ability to tour with a personal ensemble, instantly making their music more marketable.

ii. politics and religion – Classical music will always be held back unless it sheds the many standardised presentational ‘rituals’ and stock concerns which carry with them implicit sexist, racist and classist meanings. Moreover, the ties between classical music (especially choral music) and the church, mainly through its unsubstantiated claims on inherent ‘spirituality’, will always automatically separate it from other cutting-edge artistic movements and audiences.

iii. a new approach to recording – The classical recording industry must be brought into line with the pop industry, by composers learning to feel comfortable with producing a ‘definitive’ recorded version of a piece which can then be endorsed and used to promote and represent them. This is the only way that classical music can make use of the incredibly powerful, criminally untapped resource of internet promotion.

iv. a new live format – Pretty much every aspect of the concert hall ‘ritual’ has been arbitrarily assigned over time, and the swift relocation of performances into alternative venues (especially ones associated with pop performance) should nullify all of their alienating connotations. This move should be reflected in the composition of new music, appropriate for small venues, amateur ensembles, new programme formats and amplification.

v. online presence – Classical music has to start taking the internet seriously, not just for concert promotion and artist homepages, but as a means to disseminate music and access a disparate but actively inquisitive audience. By being less obsessive about copyright, new composers will actually free up their music to getting heard and thereby performed, which should end up benefiting both them and their prospective listeners.

a few closing statements

i. populism needn’t be reactionary – It also needn’t be cynical.

ii. mainstream classical music doesn’t need protecting – There will always be enough die-hard traditionalists, and endless recordings, for this part of the culture to remain safe. Something much more fundamental is at stake.

iii. pop music itself is in great shape – A new populist music movement shouldn’t aim to become pop music, nor should it strive for some genreless in-between world, but instead look to creatively and uncompromisingly return orchestral/chamber/vocal/choral music to some relevance within contemporary society and the cultural moment.

iv. music is not for musicians – This is an absolutely fundamental tenet of pop music, but in reality almost alien to classical music. A new independent classical revolution must not be afraid to be idealistic and have vision; the status quo of classical music culture is so small and cliquey that it is finally now probably totally sustainable, but it could be so much more.",<em>Towards a New Classical Music Culture</em>,,,,2014-09-21T23:30:02+00:00,12,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/12,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=158,158,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T12:12:18+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"Classical Music, Electronic Music",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/158

""Critics, myself included, persist in label-mongering, despite all warnings; we must, because it's a valid source of insight-as well as great fun.""
- Bruce Sterling, from the introduction to Mirrorshades
Bud, from Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age, is a classic cyberpunk protagonist. An aggressive, black-leather clad criminal loner with cybernetic body augmentations (including a neurolinked skull gun), Bud makes his living first as a drug runner's decoy, then by terrorizing tourists for money.

All of which goes a long way toward explaining why his ass gets wasted on page 37 of a 455 page novel.

Welcome to the postcyberpunk era.

Arguably, science fiction entered the postcyberpunk era in 1988 with the publication of Bruce Sterling's Islands in the Net. Just as Sterling's The Artificial Kid encapsulated many of cyber-punk's themes before the movement had a name, Islands in the Net prefigured a growing body of work that can (at least until someone comes up with a better name) be labeled postcyberpunk. But to understand postcyberpunk, it's important to distinguish what cyberpunk was (and wasn't) about.

Classic cyberpunk characters were marginalized, alienated loners who lived on the edge of society in generally dystopic futures where daily life was impacted by rapid technological change, an ubiquitous datsphere of computerized information, and invasive modification of the human body. William Gibson's Neuromancer is, of course, the archetypal cyberpunk work, and this (along with early Gibson short fiction like ""Johnny Mnemonic"" and ""Burning Chrome,"" The Artificial Kid, and the odd John Shirley work) is whence the ""high tech/low life"" cliché about cyberpunk and its imitators came.

The black-leather-and-chrome surface gloss was in large measure what attracted media attention, but isn't what made cyberpunk the most important science fiction literary movement since the New Wave. Cyberpunk's lasting impact came not from the milieu's details, but the method of their deployment, the immersive worldbuilding technique that gave it such a revelatory quality (what John Clute, speaking of Pat Cadigan, called ""the burning presence of the future""). Cyberpunk realized that the old SF stricture of ""alter only one thing and see what happens"" was hopelessly outdated, a doctrine rendered irrelevant by the furious pace of late 20th century technological change. The future isn't ""just one damn thing after another,"" it's every damn thing all at the same time. Cyberpunk not only realized this truth, but embraced it. To paraphrase Chairman Bruce, cyberpunk carried technological extrapolation into the fabric of everyday life.

The best of cyberpunk conveyed huge cognitive loads about the future by depicting (in best ""show, don't tell"" fashion) the interaction of its characters with the quotidian minutia of their environment. In the way they interacted with their clothes, their furniture, their decks and spex, cyberpunk characters told you more about the society they lived in than ""classic"" SF stories did through their interaction with robots and rocketships.

Postcyberpunk uses the same immersive world-building technique, but features different characters, settings, and, most importantly, makes fundamentally different assumptions about the future. Far from being alienated loners, postcyberpunk characters are frequently integral members of society (i.e., they have jobs). They live in futures that are not necessarily dystopic (indeed, they are often suffused with an optimism that ranges from cautious to exuberant), but their everyday lives are still impacted by rapid technological change and an omnipresent computerized infrastructure.

Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age is perhaps the most popular postcyberpunk novel, though also worthy of consideration are Bruce Sterling's Islands in the Net and Holy Fire, Ian McDonald's Necroville (aka Terminal Cafe), Ken MacLeod's The Star Fraction and The Stone Canal, Greg Bear's Queen of Angels, Slant, and (parts of) Moving Mars, Raphael Carter's The Fortunate Fall, some of Greg Egan's work (Egan novels like Permutation City and Diaspora are so wildly extrapolative that it's hard to fit them into any category), and the first hundred pages or so of Walter Jon Williams' Aristoi (among others).

Like their cyberpunk forebears, postcyberpunk works immerse the reader in richly detailed and skillfully nuanced futures, but ones whose characters and settings frequently hail from, for lack of a better term, the middle class. (And we do need a better term; here in the United States, economic mobility has rendered the concept of ""class"" nearly obsolete.) Postcyberpunk characters frequently have families, and sometimes even children. (Children, rather than plucky, hyperintelligent, and misunderstood teenage protagonists, being creatures all too lacking in most science fiction.) They're anchored in their society rather than adrift in it. They have careers, friends, obligations, responsibilities, and all the trappings of an ""ordinary"" life. Or, to put it another way, their social landscape is often as detailed and nuanced as the technological one.

Cyberpunk characters frequently seek to topple or exploit corrupt social orders. Postcyberpunk characters tend to seek ways to live in, or even strengthen, an existing social order, or help construct a better one. In cyberpunk, technology facilitates alienation from society. In postcyberpunk, technology is society. Technology is what the characters breathe, eat, and live in (in the case of Walter Jon William's Aristoi or Greg Egan's Diaspora, live in the literal sense of the word, with their selves (in part or in toto) immersed in the datasphere). Postcyberpunk characters dwell in what Sterling has dubbed ""permanent technological revolution"" even as we do today.

Cyberpunk tended to be cold, detached and alienated. Postcyberpunk tends to be warm, involved, and connected. (A nod here to Paul di Filippo's half-serious ""Ribofunk"" manifesto.) Cyberpunk tended toward the grim, while postcyberpunk is frequently quite funny (parts of The Diamond Age shine most brightly in this respect, as do Ken MacLeod's works.) It could even be argued that postcyberpunk represents a fusion of the cyberpunk/humanist schism of the 1980s, but: A.) I'm happy leave that particular can of worms to braver (or more foolhardy) souls, and B.) Though many a cyber-punk's work has become more humanized, the reverse doesn't seem to be true (John Kessel's recapitulation of Shiner & Sterling's ""Mozart in Mirrorshades"" in Corrupting Dr. Nice notwithstanding).

It may have been Isaac Asimov (though I first heard it via Howard Waldrop) who said there were three orders of science fiction, using the automobile as an example. Man invents the automobile and uses it to chase down the villain: adventure fiction. Man invents the automobile, and a few years later there are traffic jams: social problem fiction. In the third type, man invents the automobile, and another man invents moving pictures: fifty years later, people go to drive-in movies. It is this third order of fiction, social fabric fiction, that was at the heart of cyberpunk. Yet many a cyberpunk tale used classic plot devices (plucky young rebels topple decaying social order, etc.) to explore such issues. The best postcyberpunk moves further into third-order science fiction, the plot arising organically from the world it's set in.

Gardner Dozois's influential 1970s essay ""Living the Future: You Are What You Eat"" made this very point, noting that future societies should be depicted as ""a real, self-consistent, organic thing."" The postcyberpunk viewpoint is not outside the fishbowl looking in, but inside the fishbowl looking around. As a result, postcyberpunk frequently skirts the edge of what can be described in late 20th century English, be it the representation of data in fourth-dimensional Pikeover space in Slant to the intelligence-enhancing something that Maya realizes she's too old to embrace in Holy Fire.

Finally, there is the inevitable issue of generational relevance. Yes, cyberpunk was about the early 1980s, while postcyberpunk is about the 1990s, and cyberpunk was largely written by people in their 20s and 30s, postcyberpunk by people in their late 30s and early 40s. But another factor is at work. Many writers who grew up reading in the 1980s are just now starting to have their stories and novels published. To them cyberpunk was not a revolution or alien philosophy invading SF, but rather just another flavor of SF. Like the writers of the 1970s and 80s who assimilated the New Wave's classics and stylistic techniques without necessarily knowing or even caring about the manifestos and ideologies that birthed them, today's new writers might very well have read Neuromancer back to back with Asimov's Foundation, John Brunner's Stand on Zanzibar, and Larry Niven's Ringworld and seen not discontinuities but a continuum. They may see postcyberpunk not only as the natural language to describe the future, but the only adequate way to start extrapolating from the present.

Answers to the inevitable questions: Is postcyberpunk a movement? No. Aren't there cyberpunk or postcyberpunk works that don't fit these definitions? Yes. Sterling's Schismatrix and his other Shaper/Mechanist stories tend to defy this schema (though it becomes more applicable if you consider ""Moving in Clades,"" the last third of Schismatrix, as postcyberpunk), and Cadigan seems to have run the sequence in reverse. Aren't there many newer writers (Jack Womack, Kathleen Ann Goonan, Linda Nagata, Nicola Griffith, etc.) whose work might be labeled postcyberpunk but which you haven't gotten around to reading yet? ?Tis true. Mea culpa. Aren't there books that came out in the 1990s that look like postcyberpunk that don't fit your definitions? Alexander Jablokov's Nimbus, Paul J. McAuley's Fairyland, and, of course, Stephenson's Snow Crash, all defy this taxonomy, or else must be regarded as mutant hybrids or late arriving ""classic"" cyberpunk. Aren't these definitions rather hard and fast? Not only that, they're ham-handed, Procrustean, and will probably look misguided in many particulars a decade or so hence. Yet postcyberpunk is a very real, and very vital, part of the modern science fiction landscape. Necroville, Slant, and Holy Fire, for all their differences, have far more in common with each other than they do with most works of modern science fiction as a whole, or even with other books in the 10% of SF that isn't crap.

Of all the mutant strains currently percolating through the science fiction body politic, postcyberpunk is the one best suited to explore themes related to world of accelerating technological innovation and ever-increasing complexity in ways relevant to our everyday lives without losing the ""sense of wonder"" that characterizes science fiction at its best. This is not to say that postcyberpunk is the only game in town; science fiction writers like Octavia Butler, Stephen Baxter, and Jack McDevitt (to name but three) are all doing good work outside its boundaries. But postcyberpunk is the most important game in town, and the one best suited for honing the genre's cutting edge.

A musical revolution is upon us. The time for innovation is now.

Humans have been making music for thousands of years, but recorded music has only been around for about 120 of them. Prior to the invention of the phonographic cylinder in the late 1800’s anyone wishing to hear music had to do so in a live setting. It was the recording of music that first revolutionized the music industry. Suddenly a person could listen to music in the privacy of their own home. The means through which a music listener got their music was similar any other consumer industry: they purchased a trusted product for a set price from a reputable retailer. Record labels, the institutions that created the physical music product, had complete control over how their product got to to their customers: the music fan. Music fans became accustomed to paying whatever price was set by record labels in order to hear the music they loved but they were ultimately limited in the amount of music they could own by the size of their own pocket books.

Gradually, the popular format on which recorded music was played changed many times; phonographic cylinders gave way to vinyl discs which in turn gave way to 8 tracks and cassette tapes. With the advent of cassette tapes we saw the beginnings of the second great revolution in the music industry. Suddenly music fans could replicate the music they’d purchased themselves. This practice, bemoaned by the music industry at large, was seen as a godsend by many music fans who could now make and share copies of the music they loved for virtually nothing. This practice increased exponentially in the digital age as music fans could share digital music files with greater ease than ever before. Today, with the advent of the world wide web, portable mp3 players and file sharing services, music fans are now able to listen to any music they want, anywhere they want, any time they want for free A large “black market” for music sharing is now in full swing and the music industry as we know it is in the midst of a great paradigm shift.

So here we are. The cat is out of the bag. Music is free. But “free” no matter how appealing the word is, is not a sustainable price. Music can’t stay free forever. Musicians and artist friendly record labels should be paid for the art the make and the work they do because their livelihoods depend on it. But the two shouldn’t be mutually exclusive right? Musicians and labels should be able to get paid fairly while at the same time, music fans get the music for a price that they deem fair. Fair to one person may be $1.00 for an album, fair to someone else might be $100. Perhaps record labels are leaving a lot of money on the table by limiting the amount someone can pay. Perhaps music fans are missing the true joy that comes with supporting someone who has made something they love.

The Priceless Music Project is a platform that could bridge the gap between free music and fair pay. The Priceless Music Project aims to usher in strong artist/label/music fan relationships during the digital music paradigm shift by allowing music fans the ability to choose the amount they give in exchange for the privilege of owning and listening to a given artists music. This exchange comes with the full acknowledgement of both artist and music fan that there is indeed a direct correlation between actual monetary support and an artists ability to keep making music.

The third great paradigm shift in the history of music will be seen in a direct connection between musicians and fans. Music fans have already taken the power back But, with great power also comes great responsibility. It is now not only a music fans right, but their responsibility to choose which artists and record labels they will support by purchasing albums, attending concerts, buying band merchandise and spreading the word about the artist through social circles.

It is, with all this in mind we deliver you the 5 tenants of the Priceless Music Project


1. Music is Already Free
Music is officially free on the internet. Downloading free music does not make someone a criminal.

2. Free Music is Not Sustainable
If music remains completely free with no social or moral responsibility attached to its free acquisition an unsustainable system is created in which it is very difficult for independent artists and labels to thrive.

3. Fans Should Choose the Price of Music
Music should be available on the music fans terms at the price they set, even if that price is free. Independent artists and record labels should trust in their fans, who love their music and creativity, to take care of them by paying a fair and honest price for that music. An open and un-restricted music buying market controlled by the music fan is a necessary change for the music industry at large to once again thrive.

4. Fans Should Participate
Artists and record labels still deserve to be paid fairly for the music they make. Creating, recording and distributing music costs money. If the artists and record labels are to continue to be able to make the music they love, music fans must take an active role in supporting these artists monetarily in some way, shape, or form. Though music fans have the right to download music for free, anyone who does so has an obligation to support that artist or record label in a different way. This could be attending a live show by that artist, purchasing the artist or record labels merchandise, actively participating in spreading the word about that artist to others in their community, paying for the music at a later date, making a music video for the band or any other creative support they can lend.

5. Music is Community… everyone is from somewhere.
Music struggles to exist without community. Artists and record labels share a social responsibility with music fans to give back to the local communities that support them. A certain amount of the money paid by music fans to support independent artists and record labels should go to non-profits within the local communities that in turn support that artist and label.",<em>The Priceless Music Project Manifesto</em>,,,,2014-09-23T22:21:08+00:00,12,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/12,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=161,161,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T12:11:03+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,Digital Music,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/161

1. Be a professional. Being a professional has gotten my foot in the door of far more places than my music has. This means being on time, having a business card or CD with your info on it, not getting wasted and respecting the venue.

2. Shuffle your transitions. Matching the beats of two records may feel like magic once you learn to do it consistently, but the other methods for moving between tracks should not be forgotten. Dropping, cutting and fading can be just as effective at the right times, and will create variety in your sets.

3. Mix the old with the new. Music goes in cycles; by exposing those connections over time you can turn people onto tracks they hadn’t considered before.

4. Why choose a single genre? Each musical style or genre is a derivative of another. Connect the dots between them and weave more interesting sets. You don‚Äôt have to play everything, but don’t pidgeon-hole yourself.

5. Find the right venue. Playing minimal German techno on bad speakers in a tiny bar known for its rock n’ roll clientele is not likely to get you a return gig. Choose a venue that fits with your sound; don’t force a shoe onto the wrong foot.

6. Don’t take requests, take suggestions. DJing is not about being a human jukebox, but if you stonewall everyone who runs up to the booth you may miss an opportunity to learn about a great new track or be reminded of one you have buried in your crate.

7. Learn to play on everything. The ability to turn out a decent set on unfamiliar or shoddy equipment is the mark of a true DJ. It is only a poor craftsman who blames his tools.

8. Line In / Line Out. You don’t need to be a sound engineer, but understanding the basics of how to set up your equipment and tap into the house speakers will help you troubleshoot problems that may arise when it’s go time.

9. Don’t limit your medium. If you want to avoid missing a great tune, collect a variety of formats. It also forces you to be more flexible equipment-wise.

10. Discs do not make you a Disc Jockey. According to TheDJmanifesto.com, being a great DJ is about personality, technique and passion. Having a great music collection is just the tip of the iceberg.

11. Let the crowd influence you. A DJ cannot operate in an artistic vacuum. If the room is dead, but your next record gets two people in the corner moving to the music, follow that vein and use their energy to your advantage. Positive energy is infectious; they will help you turn things around.

12. Playlists are guides, not laws. Think while you DJ. Sticking too rigidly to a playlist doesn‚Äôt allow for any surprises or spontaneous mixes.

13. Promote. The days when DJs only played music and promoters spread the word are over. Maintain a mailing list, hit the social networking sites, share your mixes online, etc. If you want to play to an empty room, stick to your bedroom.

14. Have a Plan B. The last thing you want to do is to spend hours picking out the perfect electro set, only to realize that the DJ before you has filled the dance floor with classic disco. Always bring enough music to change things up, either as a bridge to the style you are into or to pick up where the DJ before you left off.

15. Volume is everything. What you hear in the booth is rarely what the crowd does, so check the dance floor. If the music is too loud or too soft, you will lose the crowd. Always adjust the volume throughout to keep pace with crowd density.

16. Brand yourself. People have short attention spans, so making yourself stand out is key. Things like dressing in a consistent fashion, having a logo or opening your sets with a token track can help to brand yourself.

17. Share the decks. Sharing the booth not only insures musical variety, it exposes you to new music and different ways of mixing. I have learned about a new artist or picked up a trick from just about every person I have DJ‚Äôd with.

18. BPM & Tempo. Tempo is energy, not speed. Don’t confuse the two.

19. The art of the warm up. Jumping on the decks at the height of the night and dropping bangers is fun, but not particularly difficult for a seasoned DJ. Warming up a crowd is a fine art, and is far more challenging.

20. Play what you love. If you aren‚Äôt playing what you love than DJing is just another grind.

21. Twist the knobs. This is what they are there for. There is more to DJing than selection, transition and repetition.

22. Train wreck. As an experienced DJ, never making a mistake means you probably aren’t pushing the envelope when it comes to innovative mixes.

23. XLR, RCA, 1/4‚Äù, couplers and adaptors. Pack your DJ bag like Batman’s utility belt. You never know when you are going to need an extra long RCA cable or that 1/4″ to XLR adaptor. It can save your night.

24. Push new music. People are comfortable with what they know and are resistant to change. At the infamous Paradise Garage, resident DJ Larry Levan would sometimes play tracks on repeat until the crowd took his side. This was a luxury in his position, but you shouldn’t get discouraged.

25. Don’t obsess over the demo. Too many DJs spend days, weeks, even months working to create the perfect mix in hopes that it will land them the perfect gig. Ask any successful DJ, there is far more to getting gigs than the demo.

26. Too many DJs. DJing is like surfing, it is a territorial culture. If you are looking for a gig, talk to promoters, club owners, bartenders, door guys, anyone but the other DJs. Once you have established yourself, the other DJs will let you into the fold.

27. Scratching is a tool, not a toy. Scratches are great for transitions or serve as well placed accents while you are in the mix, but too much of it can detract from the music and sour your set. Unless you are willing to practice five hours a day, chances are, you won‚Äôt be the next Invisible Scratch Pickle.

28. Avoid lazy laptop syndrome. Don’t let the BPM auto fills, cue points and ridiculous storage capacity make you lazy. Know your music, and use software to take advantage of what older technology can’t do.

29. Build a unique music collection. Contrary to popular belief, there are millions of great tracks that will never make it on the Billboard Top 100 or be found online. Having a unique collection sets you apart, and will help deflect the loudmouth hanging around the DJ booth begging to plug in their MP3 player.

30. Have Fun. If you aren’t having fun, it is unlikely that anyone else will.

Mondo 2000 is here to cover the leading edge in hyperculture. We'll bring you the latest in human/technological interactive mutational forms as they happen.

We're talking Cyber-Chautauqua: bringing cyberculture to the people! 

Artificial awareness modules. Visual music. Vidscan Magazines. Brain-boosting technologies. William Gibson's Cyberspace Matrix--fully realized!   

Our scouts are out there on the frontier sniffing the breeze and guess what?  All the old warhorses are dead. Eco-fundamentalism is out, conspiracy theory is démodé; drugs are obsolete. There's a new whiff of apocalypticism across the land. A general sense that we are living at a very special juncture in the evolution of the species. 

Back in the sixties, Carly Simon's brother wrote a book called What to Do Until the Apocalypse Comes. It was about going back to the land, growing tubers and soybeans, reading by oil lamps. Finite possibilities and small is beautiful. It was boring! 

Yet the pagan innocence and idealism that was the sixties remains and continues to exert its fascination on today's kids. Look at old footage of Woodstock and you wonder: where have all those wide-eyed, ecstatic, orgasm-slurping kids gone? They're all across the land, dormant like deeply buried perennials. But their mutated nucleotides have given us a whole new generation of sharpies, mutants and superb rights and in them we must put our faith--and power. 

The cybernet is in place. If fusion is real, we'll find out about it fast. The old information élites are crumbling. The kids are at the controls.  This magazine is about what to do until the millennium comes. We're talking about Total Possibilities. Radical assaults on the limits of biology, gravity and time. The end of Artificial Scarcity. The dawn of a new humanism High-jacking technology for personal empowerment, fun and games. Flexing those synapses! Stoking those neuropeptides! Making Bliss States our normal waking consciousness. Becoming the Bionic Angel. 

But things are going to get weirder before they get better. The Rupture before the Rapture. Social and economic dislocations that will make the Cracked 80’s look like summer camp. So, in the words of the immortal Rudy Rucker, ""Hang ten on the edge"" because the 90's are going to be quite a ride!

The Arab World is in revolt and China is rising up alongside the US as a rival (state capitalism with no conscience).  Fuel and energy sources are becoming precious.  Climate and environmental change has to be addressed.  Data access and media scrutiny are more widespread than ever before.

So what kind of literature can we expect in this era?  The cyberpunk of Gibson’s time focused on rapid technological change with no positive change in society.  The rich got richer, the poor kept getting screwed, and computer hackers were overtaking old-school mobsters as the hot new criminal occupation.  Transhumanism became just another fad instead of the answer to all of humanity’s problems.  What defined these stories was a sense of alienation, which was understandable if you were an author who’d just lived through the bleak Seventies.

But what about today?  Are we still as alienated as the original cyberpunks felt and wrote?

In a way, it could be argued that, the more things change, the more they stay the same, and certainly cyberpunk is a response to that adage.  Despite the proliferation of the World Wide Web and greater global exchange, we remain a fragmented and hostile world.  Terrorism has overtaken Communism as the new grim specter, with religious extremists and insurgencies rapidly gaining ground through the Web and mobile technology.  Scandals are more common occurrences thanks to carelessness with digital technology, along with increased scrutiny by both mainstream and alternative media groups.  The news media itself has become more fragmented thanks to the rise of cable news networks and online journalism, as it becomes more profitable to pander to niche audiences than to garner a larger viewership.

We live in an era of fear.  An era where everything happens fast.  S/he who posts first and frequently gets to determine the course of the conversation.  We also live in an era of commentary.  There is almost nothing in the common media that can be taken objectively now.  Everything deserves a comment from the audience, which may or may not devolve into yet another bitter Internet argument if the subject under discussion is even remotely controversial.

We live in a world that speaks up more than it used to.  Protest movements can be organized within an hour in any place across the globe.  Backlash against a movie, TV show, book, political campaign, or other product can be far more immediate and devastating.  Good PR is critical in business.

On the other hand…

It’s easier to check up on your facts now.  It’s easier to talk, make friends, and do business with people in other countries now.  It’s easier to make your work known with the right amounts of online views and/or viral marketing.  It’s easier to get your message or your product out, no matter how much money you have or how “traditional” your industry is.

The world is becoming more democratic.  Corporations may still be insanely powerful and unchecked, yet consumers can band together and make their displeasure known fast.  Political leaders may still be tossing out lies and deceiving voters, but there are plenty of sites dedicated to checking their claims and analyzing legislation from the moment of inception.  We’re still cynical, but we also get passionate about causes and having a global perspective means we can more easily learn and care about stopping dictators in Sudan or backing protests in China.

The truth is struggling to make itself known, but it still has a chance–and that should be the rallying cry of the New Cyberpunk.  Not “the truth shall set you free,” but “You must set the truth free.”  Recognize the face behind the online avatar.  Examine the lie within the celebrity’s statement.  Call out your leaders and neighbors when they bear false witness.  Truthful testimony could be the new currency.  We can tell a lot about ourselves through Twitter and YouTube.  We can learn a lot about each other from online journalism and Wikipedia.

Perhaps the characters of the New Cyberpunk must finally forego all claims of privacy in the World Wide Web.  They must walk their own Via Dolorosa, accepting a crown of thorns from Internet trolls and being crucified for every inflammatory comment or false claim they make, however accidental it might be.  Because once they learn to handle the emotional rollercoaster, they can conquer the fear and the fragmentation.  They can conquer the little death of privacy and begin a new ministry: the work of upholding human interests and rights on the digital frontier.  They’re gunslingers who become sheriffs (or rather, admins), helping tame the Wild Web one online forum at a time.  They stand up for the right to share the truth of oneself, even if it means censure and shame.  They will express themselves as they see fit, even if they have to put up with the idiocy and malice of their neighbors for the same reasons.

The antagonists of New Cyberpunk stories are not just corporations and criminal syndicates.  The true antagonist is despair–the inability to comprehend what power we literally have at our fingertips, but spend only for the purposes of keeping ourselves occupied and entertained.  It’s despair that drives people to become terrorists and trolls, to subvert rather than create, to become famous by being outrageous rather than inspiring.  To counter despair, the new heroes must bring hope.  To counter lies and fragmentation, the new heroes must bring truth and fellowship.  The only monsters are the ones we create for ourselves.  We don’t need swords to cut them down.  We just need to plant a seed of truth and give it the chance to grow.

In retrospect, this isn’t really a manifesto or an attempt to speak on behalf of a movement.  It’s just one writer’s opinion, trying to speak truth the only way he knows.

You don’t need to speak for us -- we are talking.

by Dorothy Kim & Eunsong Kim on April 7th, 2014
We enter Twitter because we believe it’s a medium that’s not hostile to women of color writers, thinkers, and conversations — but perhaps we should reconsider.

Perhaps each time we log in, we should re-read Twitter’s privacy agreement, their legally binding contract. Perhaps we should remind each other and ourselves that Twitter is a closed, private corporation, with corporate dreams and nightmares. Perhaps we should remind each other that Twitter’s model is the antithesis of open access, creative commons, feminist, Marxist, queer — take your pick. Perhaps we should remind each other that such financial and structural impediments should motivate us to converse elsewhere — to build our own platform or to inhabit a platform that functions beyond mere profit.

But most of us enter because it is a designated ‘mediated public space’. danah boyd writes that “Social network sites are the latest generation of ‘mediated publics’ – environments where people can gather publicly through mediating technology. In some senses, mediated publics are similar to the unmediated publics with which most people are familiar – parks, malls, parking lots, cafes, etc.”

A french cafe scene, with many tables close together with different parties packed into the sidewalk seating area.

Pre-existing social networks are spaces we go to for public conversation. The dream of building our own structures complements the decolonization of the public spaces that we are invested in.

Lately, the hostility of Twitter has become even more apparent. The emotional and intellectual labor of women of color is being casually appropriated/borrowed to benefit and support the narratives of established journalists writing for large platforms. The work and organization of WOC on Twitter has been taken by journalists and turned into mainstream stories, news articles, Buzzfeed listicles, and more — without the writers or activists being asked, credited, cited, or paid. As Tina Vasquez has insightfully reported in “What’s Missing from Journalists’ Tactic of Snagging Stories from Twitter? Respect.”, this is compounded because so many of the journalists who write about Twitter are male and/or white.

In fact, Vasquez points out that when discussing the sensitive topic of what women wore when they were raped — a discussion that was meant to counter the idea that women “asked for it” by what they wore — “the only person to respectfully cover…[this] was The Root’s Jenée Desmond-Harris.” Vasquez identifies as a Latina and Desmond-Harris is an African American female journalist. Considering the paucity of minority and/or women writers in mainstream newsrooms, it should not shock that race and gender affects the quality of reporting. Other mainstream news sources, like Buzzfeed, just “fucked everything up.”.

Mainstream media perpetuates a litany of such moments. When this co-optation and abuse is contested, liberal democrats like Hamilton Nolan tell us to chill out. In his article “Twitter is Public,” Nolan patronizes women of color feminists that have taken up debates around Twitter harvesting. Only he understands the definition of public and how Twitter functions. He assumes patriarch duties, explaining to us that the world is unfair and that we must reread our contract with Twitter. If you want to stay in the public sphere shut up, he says with benevolent nonchalance.You can leave and go elsewhere, he repeats, rolling his eyes.

Gosh, we’re so silly and stuff. Thanks Hammy.

How could we forget that “public” means free WOC labor, the upliftment of corporate profiteering? That “public” means exploitation is fair game — those with the bigger tools get to wildly appropriate the language of others for their own private and personal gains. Public means white property laws; public means not safe for women of color; public means not safe for marginalized voices — public means that we must be grateful to exist in their sphere.

Disrupting Fordian Hierarchies of Profit
Kathleen Fitzpatrick’s Planned Obsolescence, published as a print book (NYU Press, 2011) and through open-access peer review in 2009 (Media Commons Press) opens up the question of knowledge formation, credit, and idea access. Though she is primarily thinking about the academic publishing enterprise and how academic knowledge is owned, reviewed, and disseminated — like a Ford factory assembly line — her points also fit in thinking about non-academic digital labor and digital writing.

She writes: “Digital networks, as structures that facilitate interaction, communication, and interconnection, will require us to think differently about what it is we’re doing as we write. As the example of the blog might suggest, communities best engage with one another around writing that is open rather than closed, in process rather than concluded.”

There has been a push and pull in academic communication about the different systems of knowledge formation and dissemination. Academic presses — like many of our contemporary media companies — cling to old Fordian models of knowledge ownership, production, and dissemination.

Owned, reviewed, and disseminated is also a perfect way to describe the “Twitter to Buzzfeed to Mainstream” media model. Tweets are appropriated by Buzzfeed journalists for their smartsnark articles, then mainstream media platforms come to further monetize Buzzfeed’s scavenger hunts. This cycle repeats.

Fitzpatrick’s work explains and advocates for a different future: the planned obsolescence of the Fordian model in academic knowledge production. For a future that will involve collaborative production, distributed access, and constant revision and reformation of knowledge. In other words, the end of fixed, sellable products (i.e. a book that has ended) and instead the imagining of knowledge environments, communication, and feedback loops where knowledge is constantly rethought, revised, reinvented.

Twitter was imagined as a micro-blogging platform. In its own words, the founders of Twitter have described their goals as focusing on the “user experience” organized around “serendipity.” However, more recently it has been remarked by Dan Farber that “Twitter is basically a mass-scale marketing platform, in which every tweeter is a marketer and every follower a set of eyeballs and a potential re-marketer.”

However, the driving force has been about “interaction, communication, and interconnection” amongst its users. Thus, as an open system, its platform has recently shown how collaborative engagement, learning, and conversations have pulsed as a dynamic process that has produced hashtag conversations, political action, and WOC vocalization. We’re thinking about #solidarityisforwhitewomen started by Mikki Kendall; #EconomicViolence originated by Andy Smith and @prisonculture; #ChangeTheName #NotYourMascot by Dani (@xodanix3), Jacqueline Keeler, and other Native feminists; and #NotYourAsianSideKick by Suey Park. The conversations generated by these hashtags and their users have vibrated throughout the web, and are still ongoing. While twitter can be innovative and surprising as an activist tool, contradictions have emerged from Twitter the medium, Twitter the corporation, and Twitter the Public.

Particularly, as Suey Park & David Leonard have discussed in “In Defense of Twitter Feminism”, we have noticed the growing trend of unabashedly harvesting WOC intellectual labor for both journalistic and academic study. Trudy (Gradient Lair) has written prolifically about the plagiarism her site and her intellectual labor have witnessed in her post “I Could Not Be Any More Tired of Academia and I Am Not Even A Part of It.” She writes that, “I have not gotten any better at dealing with the demand that I should be ‘flattered’ by people who ‘chose’ to exploit me over anyone else that they could have ‘chosen.’ ”

Journalists, academics and mainstream media platforms that quote out of context, quote without permission, or plagiarize are not performing acts of kindness — they are abusing their powers as gatekeepers. They are positioning themselves as the managers of relevant information, and disregarding the informational systems and dialogues that are organically taking place.

In order to reject the normalization of this kind of exploitation, we must rethink the continuation of this Fordian model of knowledge production where the “owner/author” –who is often not the original content creator — gets the credit for the “product” being sold on the marketplace. These are old and conservative approaches to business and knowledge creation, yet these two different models (Ford vs. Planned Obsolescence) appear to constantly butt heads. Even in smarter business circles this older, Fordian model has been superseded. Yet, corporations like Twitter seem unable to absorb that shift completely in their business model.

Twitter the corporation runs on Ford Factory logic; Twitter the tool can be revolutionary.

The Triple Bottom-Line and the Circular Economy
The Economist neatly explains a disruption in the Fordian logics of production, assembly, sale and consumption (and of course, the added points of waste).

We must complicate the linear product and the dream of the assembly line model. For example, the idea of the “Triple Bottom Line” was first coined by John Elkington 20 years ago. The idea argues that companies “should be preparing three different bottom lines:

profit–the more traditional idea of a corporate profit model;
people–how socially responsible a company is to its stakeholders and workers;
planet–it’s environmental responsibility.”
In order to do business in the new economic world, a company should take the Triple Bottom Line into account in order to think about their business model as an integrated process. All three lines — profit, people, planet — function in a system that interacts and works with each other. So the question is: how does Twitter think about their business modeling in relation to their distributive platform? For Twitter, striving for the Triple Bottom Line would create a business model fueled by process rather than linear product. Such a model would privilege the generation of ideas –particularly radical rather than just capitalist ideas — as its main objective. This privileging would ensure circular movement within the company. The process of thinking through monetary profits, social responsibility to people, and sustainability for the world should mean that Twitter would be functioning in a way that thinks about all these three strands entwined together.

How does monetary profit intermix when social responsibility to people (both workers and users) intertwine with environmental sustainability? As Antony Kim (leading environmental architect, Schmidt-McArthur Fellow) argues, “sustainability is a process not a product.” One shouldn’t in fact think about “sustainability” or any of these terms “social responsibility” or even “profit” as a singular and product-driven solution. In other words, slapping solar panels on the Twitter office building does not make it more “sustainable.” Rather, it is part of the many systematic things a corporation can do to achieve sustainability. Sustainability is “a moving target,” very much like “social responsibility” to people and “monetary profit” are moving targets.

Profit, People, and Planet
Profit, people and planet are part of an ongoing process that must involve collaborative work — and we must flatten hierarchies to achieve our constantly evolving, systematic goals.

If Twitter commits to these intertwined goals, they should continually be considering how the intellectual output and the energy and labor of their users must be compensated and remain sustainable and ethical. As Lisa Nakamura has written, invisible WOC labor is behind the digital profits of companies like Apple. Likewise, Twitter’s future profits are particularly lucrative to international business commerce compared to Facebook and other social media sites due to its broader and more diverse demographic of higher African American and Latino users.

Yet, there is no distribution of this wealth down to its invisible WOC laborers.

Profit, Archives, and Methodology
“If these are your records–where are your memories???”

The Twitter Corporation is a leading innovator of digital archiving. At any time, users can download their personal tweet history. The Library of Congress is storing all of our public tweets and Twitter’s sophisticated search functions have streamlined internet sleuthing. Their archiving system is one of the most futuristic and elite programs in existence–they are redefining how to archive the internet.

This should concern us for various reasons, but specifically because:

This archive system is like Twitter: it is closed, private, profit driven, and top-down.
The archive system follows an ancient model of provenance/collecting: the objects belong to the purchaser, The Man With The Papers.
This private, closed archive will have a significant importance in the future–it will be a constant source of data mining possibilities (and Twitter the corporation will have no incentive not to gatekeep according to its politics and desires).
Just like the Fordist model of production needing to be eradicated, there is no reason for Twitter the corporation to abide by ancient archival methods. We challenge Twitter to innovate beyond its sleek technological updates–we challenge it to innovate its definitions and methods.

Alternatives to Singular Provenance
Twitter doesn’t have to look far. Postcolonial archivists have been coming up with innovative solutions to singular provenance. There are several alternative possibilities. For example, just to list a few possibilities:

1. Parallel provenance
This conceptualizes the necessity for stories/process/experience to be centered as authors, by politicizing and variegating the notion of origins.

2. Co-creatorship
By deploying postcolonial and native studies methodologies, co-creatorship pushes to acknowledges both ‘keeper of the record’ and the ‘storyteller’ as authors. (Chris Hurley, Anne J. Gilliland)

3. Centering provenance as ethnicity
Here, the object is located with whom it is most useful–centering the subject of the archive as the author, rather than conquerors/managers or record keeper. (Joel Wurl)

But maybe this is all too revolutionary for Twitter the Fordist Factory.

Archivist Chris Hurley writes, “In cyberspace, the essence of recordkeeping will not lie in the management of digital objects but in narratives about formation, function, and process.” To this effect, we would like to decenter the author, product, archive, profit-linear progression and reimagine a digital future in which the Triple Bottom Line and planned obsolescence are the angle of Twitter’s functionality. There would be flattened hierarchies of production, sharing, citation, and labor to create a different digital future.

We have written a #TwitterEthics manifesto. We want to reimagine the intersection (and the methodologies to inspect) of race, gender, labor and the digital future in both journalism and academia.

The #TwitterEthics Manifesto
This is based on a collected open twitter conversation asked to the community about #TwitterEthics.

What should the twitter ethics be in journalism and academic research? What are the ethics for journalists and academic researchers on twitter? What should journalists and academics do to respect all WOC feminists? What do we need to do to make sure we are not exploiting intellectual labor and property? How do we strive to be good allies?

Eunsong (@clepsydras) tweeted that “too often, woc ideas go uncited–or become situated as ‘raw material’ for appropriation.” The bare minimum as @SonminBong, @sharmanifowler, and @jazzycrayon discussed is credit, citation, attribution. But we should go further than the bare minimum: both academics and journalists should ask each individual user on Twitter for consent. They should explain the context and the usage of their tweets.

But these are just very small baselines that replicate the already exploitative terrain of Twitter’s interaction with old media. The more useful paradigm is to think about disrupting this model entirely. If we want Twitter to be a space for conversation/ideas, we have to be aware of the uneven distribution of power positions.

If we want to transform the space to what we want it to be, we must disrupt this system. We must consider a methodology that eschews the exploitation of digital labor and the structural violence enacted towards WOC feminist digital bodies.

For starters we can all:

1. Reject the object-oriented approach
Don’t turn WOC into “objects of analysis” – refuse the subject/object divide. As explained in “Gawking at Rape Culture,” WOC narratives and voices become quickly commodified without consent or permission. The women are objects to be gazed upon and studied. The journalist appropriates, rewrites, and circulates her story — and in this process, becomes the speaking subject. A different way to think about the subject/object is to look at the work of Karen Barad who flattens the subject-object hierarchy from a vertical top to bottom relation to one that is horizontal and ever shifting, such as Meeting the Universe Halfway. Her theories of entanglements especially in relation to gendered computer programming reimagine subject/object relationships in a distributive platform system.

2. Recognize that journalists, reporters, media companies, professors are not leaders of the analysis — there is no bird’s eye view.
There is no hierarchical system and linear model of production. Instead production, analysis, discussion must be decentered.

As a medium, Twitter is decentered–that’s why gatekeeper journalists and conservative luddites continue to warn us about the dangers of the messy, uncontrollable, fragmented nature of twitter conversations.

For decentering hierarchies, we can also look to models of publication. In European Others: Queering Ethnicity in Postnational Europe, Fatima El-Tayeb describes Audre Lorde’s interactions with black feminists in Germany. When approached by publishers interested in translating her work, Lorde convinced them instead to anthologize Afro-German female narratives. As a collection of stories and interviews, from women 17 to 70, El-Tayeb writes that since its inception, Showing Our Colors: Afro-German Women Speak Out has become the key Afro-German text. This example illustrates that while authoritative voices are important to our cultural milieus, sometimes what culture needs most are emergent narratives. A way to make this happen is for the Authoritative Figure/acknowledged writer/centered subject to step aside and listen. And when necessary, partake in ethical anthologizing of what has been said.

3. Move away from the pyramid to a circular system that values process over product.
For journalistic and academic enterprise, this means sharing and shuffling the analysis feedback loop so it allows folks to ask questions to the data themselves. Twitter the tool is not a pyramid, it’s circular. Twitter’s model makes an authoritative position impossible for anyone who operates within its framework. There is no product for Twitter. It deals in information exchange, it is foundationally process-based and therefore: circular. Why should there be one gatekeeping access point at the top (the current approach journalists have taken, that Twitter the corporation practices)? Instead, we must have multiple points of entry, access, and distribution (rhizomatic). This is actually a model in folklore studies, but is a rare methodology in most academic research.

4. Allow for a multiplicity of views.
We must reject the idea of “expert” with regard to WOC Twitter. If we believe in the value of a multiplicity of views and narratives, then the system, the analysis, the work should allow for a plurality of views. Thus, #TwitterEthics is about radical scholarly and journalistic practice that decenters hierarchies by rejecting the idea of expert. Instead, it asks for the development of co-creatorships, co-authorships. It should collaborate with Twitter users to write their narratives, their analyses, and map their activisms and conversations.

5. Academics should move towards radical research systems that circulate and open dialogue up to participatory modes.
This is something the digital humanities particularly have been able to push for with new radical pedagogy and methodologies. Research projects can strive to structure work to break and decenter credit, analysis, and commentary in order to share and spread it through distributed networks. This subverts the top-down, gatekeeping, pyramid model (please see the work of @adelinekoh and @roopikarisam #DHPoco on both academic labor and study and archive work).

Radical Epistemologies
We can’t move forward to new tech with old methodology — this is a recipe to maintain old power.

We must rethink and consider more radical epistemologies that will push forward an ongoing cycle of consent, credit, citation, and participation.

Twitter, you are planning your own obsolescence by running on the Ford Factory Logic, by keeping us out of your archives, by turning our language into property, and making it acceptable for us to be exploited by journalists.

In the end, the work, the credit, the compensation, and the view need to be a shared, collaborative process. Twitter and New Media journalism, the internet and technology involves all of us. The voices on the platform are multiple, collective, dissenting, singular, and loud. You don’t need to speak for us–we are talking.

Both an intervention in creative software design and open access, once GNU is acquired, users are entitled to four freedoms: ""The freedom to run the program as you wish; the freedom to copy the program and give it away to your friends and co-workers; the freedom to change the program as you wish, by having full access to source code; the freedom to distribute an improved version and thus help build the community.""",,,EN,,,,<a>https://www.gnu.org/</a>,,"Copyright © 1985, 1993, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2014 Free Software Foundation, Inc.","<a href=""https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html"">https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html</a>","Open Access, GNU","Overview of the GNU System

The GNU operating system is a complete free software system, upward-compatible with Unix. GNU stands for “GNU's Not Unix”. Richard Stallman made the Initial Announcement of the GNU Project in September 1983. A longer version called the GNU Manifesto was published in March 1985. It has been translated into several other languages.

The name “GNU” was chosen because it met a few requirements; first, it was a recursive acronym for “GNU's Not Unix”, second, because it was a real word, and third, it was fun to say (or Sing).

The word “free” in “free software” pertains to freedom, not price. You may or may not pay a price to get GNU software. Either way, once you have the software you have four specific freedoms in using it. The freedom to run the program as you wish; the freedom to copy the program and give it away to your friends and co-workers; the freedom to change the program as you wish, by having full access to source code; the freedom to distribute an improved version and thus help build the community. (If you redistribute GNU software, you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, or you may give away copies.)

The project to develop the GNU system is called the “GNU Project”. The GNU Project was conceived in 1983 as a way of bringing back the cooperative spirit that prevailed in the computing community in earlier days—to make cooperation possible once again by removing the obstacles to cooperation imposed by the owners of proprietary software.

In 1971, when Richard Stallman started his career at MIT, he worked in a group which used free software exclusively. Even computer companies often distributed free software. Programmers were free to cooperate with each other, and often did.

By the 1980s, almost all software was proprietary, which means that it had owners who forbid and prevent cooperation by users. This made the GNU Project necessary.

Every computer user needs an operating system; if there is no free operating system, then you can't even get started using a computer without resorting to proprietary software. So the first item on the free software agenda obviously had to be a free operating system.

We decided to make the operating system compatible with Unix because the overall design was already proven and portable, and because compatibility makes it easy for Unix users to switch from Unix to GNU.

A Unix-like operating system includes a kernel, compilers, editors, text formatters, mail software, graphical interfaces, libraries, games and many other things. Thus, writing a whole operating system is a very large job. We started in January 1984. The Free Software Foundation was founded in October 1985, initially to raise funds to help develop GNU.

By 1990 we had either found or written all the major components except one—the kernel. Then Linux, a Unix-like kernel, was developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and made free software in 1992. Combining Linux with the almost-complete GNU system resulted in a complete operating system: the GNU/Linux system. Estimates are that tens of millions of people now use GNU/Linux systems, typically via GNU/Linux distributions. The principal version of Linux now contains non-free firmware “blobs”; free software activists now maintain a modified free version of Linux, called Linux-libre.

However, the GNU Project is not limited to the core operating system. We aim to provide a whole spectrum of software, whatever many users want to have. This includes application software. See the Free Software Directory for a catalogue of free software application programs.

We also want to provide software for users who are not computer experts. Therefore we developed a graphical desktop (called GNOME) to help beginners use the GNU system.

We also want to provide games and other recreations. Plenty of free games are already available.

How far can free software go? There are no limits, except when laws such as the patent system prohibit free software. The ultimate goal is to provide free software to do all of the jobs computer users want to do—and thus make proprietary software a thing of the past.",<em>The GNU Manifesto</em>,,,,2014-10-23T18:35:25+00:00,1,collections,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/collections/1,,1,files,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/files?item=171,171,1,Document,item_types,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/item_types/1,2014-10-26T12:07:35+00:00,16245,users,http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/users/16245,True,"GNU, Open Access",http://digitalmanifesto.omeka.net/api/items/171

Music technology has never been more exciting.  Every day brings new ways to be musical through new software, instruments, devices, platforms and protocols for fans, artists, and organizations.  People are experimenting with new ways to perform, collaborate and compose, to listen to their favorite artists and discover new ones, and to share the music they love.

Music technologies help us explore what it means to be human, to create, and to participate.  Music has always been technological.  Bone flutes and drums are among the oldest known technologies.  But music technologies are more than devices. They range from instruments and objects to toys, musical scales, notation, concert venues, software, books, policies, laws, copyright, platforms, habits and more.  They are ways of doing and being. They are both ordinary and extraordinary. Music gains life through an enormous range of practices and spaces.

Music technologies create possible futures and offer new ways to inhabit the present and past. Their changes presage changes in culture, signaling trends yet to come. They are thus sites of struggles over money, membership, power, and prestige.  Technological change is inseparable from economic, cultural and political change.

…But It Can Be More

Meaningful innovation is sustainable and just – yet the current landscape of music technology favors short-term profit-making, too often at the expense of deeper cultural concerns. Landfills swell with carelessly-designed consumer electronics, discs, cartridges, instruments, toys and gadgets. Like other cultural workers, many who contribute most to the richness of musical cultures lead increasingly precarious economic lives. But those who stand to profit the most economically have the biggest say in policy discussions. Too often music technologies are used as tools of exclusion rather than inclusion. Because what counts as “music,” “technology,” and “music technology” is unsettled, those with the most power create the most powerful definitions.

Meaningful innovation bridges multiple perspectives – yet the music technology field remains predominantly white, male, and tends toward assumptions that its user base is Western and able-bodied. Music is too often denigrated as frivolous or fetishized as sacred, shutting down discussion, action and investment in transformation. Technology, too, is fetishized, as if it did not come from and contribute to particular cultural worlds. It suffers from the glamour of the new, when it should be understood within its long history.

Meaningful innovation happens when fields intersect – yet those who work in music technology are too often siloed in distinct fields within universities, industry, startups, journalism, hobbyist and fan subcultures. We don’t always know how to think together, and we often do not know what others can contribute. We don’t even know what we don’t know. When fields do come together, old hierarchies too often overshadow the spirit of collaboration and mutual learning. Institutional barriers challenge our ability to work together, from the way organizations are structured to reward-systems that encourage people to keep doing what they have always done.

Let’s Build Better Worlds

Music technologies make worlds. Let us make better worlds. Let music technology do good, serve public interest, foster belonging, justice, collaboration and sharing, enable greater access to positive musical experiences and personal connections, and create durable objects and practices.

We call for greater awareness of the cultural forces already in new music technologies, and the courage to challenge or change them when the collective good demands it.

Ask of any music technology: For whom will this make things better? How? Is it open or closed to creativity and innovation it has not yet anticipated?

Ask of any policy: Whose rights and opportunities are being promoted?  Whose are being eroded? What idea of culture does it presume?

Ask of any practice: Who is invited to join in? Who is left out? Where will it find support?

Ask of any organization: How does it help people come together? Does it exploit them in doing so?

We must create more opportunities for people to engage one another through music. We must fight for people’s rights to create music and music technologies, and to enjoy music free of rent-seeking and unwarranted legal intimidation. We must stand up to abusive musical practices, from exploiting people’s dreams of making a living in music, to criminalizing whole classes of audiences and musicians, to subjecting people to hearing loss, to the use of music in coercion, warfare and torture.

Those concerned with music technology must develop a sense of ourselves as a “we” across different fields: creators, theorists, scholars, engineers, journalists, lawyers, activists, policy-makers, and others all together. We may not always agree, but we must have a sense of the whole and of our places within it.  We must acknowledge one another as equals so that we can collaborate on equal footing.

We call for cultural policies that foster music in its many forms and understand music technology as integral to culture.  We call for policies that support the arts through practices that go beyond markets. We call for a long-term perspective that privileges collective meaning and sustainability over profit. We call for everyone with a stake in music to have equally powerful voices in policy.

We call on scholars of music technology to ask big, important, difficult questions.  We call on their institutions to expand the range of practices that are considered legitimate modes of inquiry and to reduce barriers to collaboration.

We call for spaces that foster the highest levels of intellectual engagement through serious, sustained, challenging discussions and through play and creativity. We call for large and small venues where people work together across divisions—industrial, cultural, intellectual—in order to create more meaningful music technologies and to support others doing the same. We call for speakers, panels, conferences, and meetings to include people who may not seem to belong there.  We call on music technologists to explore venues where they may not think they fit.

We call on companies to produce music technologies that matter, that foster meaningful communities, that consider musical culture and user bases as much more than cash registers.

We call for technologies to be created with an eye for the long-term. Musical objects should last as long as the materials out of which they are made or they should be modular, recyclable, or transformable. They should be forward-compatible whenever possible.  Data must be portable and not bound to a particular company or platform.  At the same time, standards must not become coercive.  Music is not standard. We must cultivate the freedom to build and use nonstandard tools.

We are Music Technologists. We work in science, art, engineering, humanities, activism, social science, policy and industry. We believe in music technology and we want to build better worlds. We invite you to join us.

Submitted by patrick.collins on Fri, 12/16/2011 - 14:17

Here is the text from our Manifesto (Alex Ross and I) Media Ecology: The Effects of Emergence

Equilibrium

 All ecology is self-correcting, while the introduction of something new may result in an instance of chaos, the nature of ecological systems return to equilibrium.  In this way the instance of chaos is the first step toward progress.

Responsible Disruption

 It is the duty of those anticipating the future of media to engage in responsible disruption.  Responsible disruption is the thoughtful introduction of a chaos-inducing element into the ecology of the dominant media.  This emerging element will be controversial based on the old concept of the media ecology, but is necessary to progress even if the result is far different from the intention of the media (i.e. Napster)

Cognitive Freedom (Surplus)

Cognitive freedom arises when a person is no longer constrained by the media around them.  Web media allows people to think about whatever it is they choose too.  No longer is it about what’s on TV, what’s in the newspaper on your doorstep in the morning, or generally speaking the biases of those delivering content.  When, unconstrained in this manner, a person can seek the information they choose.  Web infrastructure allows for micro-connections to be made and for communities and organizations to be built around these micro-connections.  The result is that media ecology is no longer heavily weighted toward the top.  There has been a distinct shift from a centralized form of dissemination to decentralized.  The result is that media ecology is less vertical and more horizontal and diffuse.

Forced Awareness

 Traditionally, New Media has been eased in to our culture.  This is no longer the case.  The speed at which technology is developed causes us to be bombarded with New Media daily; on TV, the internet, radio even.  Even the delivery is abnormal: iPads/tablets, smartphones, QR codes, youth vernacular.  The rate of change will not slow down.  You must assimilate New Media at a blistering pace.  However, you must also integrate these advancements appropriately to your lifestyle.  Do not concern yourself with mass appeal.  Find what works for you.

Camouflaged Evolution

 New Media is often paired in bundles with the old.  Updates and re-designs are constantly being downloaded and integrated (often while you sleep).  Technology will not ask if you are ready.  It is constantly evolving through appropriation and interaction.  It will never reach a state of closure. “Choice” has been replaced with “Adaptation.” (i.e. Wi-Fi televisions with apps)

World Consciousness

With remarkable amounts of data at our fingertips today we can in many ways map out the ebbs and flows of the world consciousness.  The biorhythm of this consciousness; how people are thinking and what they’re thinking about in our world can be collected, analyzed, and even mapped out.  This global awareness is shifting by the minute, forcing people to change their own perceptions about what is going on around them and changing what they think about.  Popular web based tools, such as Twitter, aren’t used by everybody but those people’s thoughts are still being shaped by that tool.  This constant shaping and reshaping of the world consciousness means that media ecology is in a constant state of flux.

Mass Complexity

As asserted media ecology in the networked age can enable people to think freely, explore the world around them, and be part of a global consciousness.  However, this increased complexity is fragile and may come with unsustainable costs.  As this complexity increases at continuously escalating rates the ability for the individual or the system will be ever strained.  There will be cognitive costs for the individual; a person will have to spend an ever increasing amount of capital just to be able to keep up.  There will also be a great taxation on the network infrastructure itself.  This comes at the cost of having to build, maintain, and improve the ever complex network.  The human race is the environment in which the media ecology exists, so in this way the human race is also the Achilles heel of the media ecosystem.

 

Reflection:

My understanding of the concept of “Media Ecology” changed drastically over the course of the semester as I developed a greater awareness of the landscape of media and the notion of emergence.  The three aspects that Jeff explained to us were confusing as first (particularly “what we think with”) but I found the ideas interesting enough to request this subject for the final manifesto project.  Beyond the three aspects, “Media Ecology” became a larger and larger theme throughout all of my classes and a concept that was extremely hard to pin down when working on a manifesto.

The real breakthrough for the team was the simple semantic dissection of the word.  Once we decided to focus on the ‘ecology” aspect and treat the media world as a complex ecosystem, things began to fall into place.  Media became more than the result of changing technologies, it is natural and organic as it is a true product of humanity.  Media has truly begun to take on a life of its own and has evolved based of necessity not through strict control.  In relation to the other three manifestos, we see that this evolution is heavily dependent on “Freedom” to allow adaption.  “Collaboration” has become key to this evolution as well, where media is changing so rapidly it can no longer be reliant on a single person to develop the next progression.  “Interplay” has also been crucial to maintaining strength in the ecology by spreading dominance among a variety of facets rather than focusing on a solitary media.

This was a great topic and we had a fantastic team, but in retrospect every one of the topics had amazing potential and all of the teams did a great job with their particular subject matter.  The real beauty of this course was that I did not realize how much I was learning until I could stop and take the time to reflect on the complete progression of ideas.

We Are FemTechNet

Note: You may download PDFs of the (Fem)Manifesto in three languages. Scroll down to see the links.

FemTechNet is committed to making the accessible, open, accountable, transformative and transforming educational institutions of our dreams. We are feminist academic hacktivism.

FemTechNet is an international movement of feminist thinkers, researchers, writers, teachers, artists, professors, librarians, mentors, organizers and activists sharing resources and engaging in activities that demonstrate connected feminist thinking about technology and innovation.

FemTechNet understands that technologies are complex systems with divergent values and cultural assumptions. We work to expand critical literacies about the social and political implications of these systems.

FemTechNet is cyberfeminist praxis: we recognize digital and other technologies can both subvert and reinscribe oppressive relations of power and we work to make these complex relations of power transparent.

FemTechNet is hard at work creating better tools.

FemTechNet has no observers, only participants.

Accountability is a feminist technology.

Collaboration is a feminist technology.

Collectivity is a feminist technology.

Care is a feminist technology.

Irony, comedy, making a mess, and gravitas are feminist technologies.

No one holds the trademark on feminist pedagogy—it is collective intellectual property.

FemTechNet is part of and bigger than the contemporary university.

FemTechNet is fueled by our civil rights, anti-racist, queer, decolonizing, trans- feminist pedagogies as we work within the belly of the beast of neoliberal austerity, normalized precarity, neo-colonial techno-missionary evangelism and MOOC fever towards the radical redistribution, reinvention, and repurposing of technological, material, emotional, academic, and monetary resources.

FemTechNet is a power tool.

FemTechNet is distributed expertise.

FemTechNet is an experiment in solidarity.

FemTechNet recognizes the often-prohibitive tuition fees and other costs associated with post-secondary education and so works both within and well beyond university and college classrooms to open learning opportunities for and from a wide range of participants.

FemTechNet knows that the majority of us are not paid a sustainable wage, and works for economic justice as a feminist principle.

FemTechNet knows that ultimately none of us is protected by our institutions, so we need to take care of each other.

FemTechNet works across rank, to record feminist genealogies and technological innovations of the past, present and future.

We are a work group.

We are a social network.

We are many genders.

We are an innovative learning technology.

We are FemTechNet.

        The Kanisza Triangle:

        Created in 1976-79 by Gaetano Kanizsa, Italian psychologist and artist, founder of the Institute of Psychology of Trieste. An optical illusion, linked above, comprised of three black circles with equal wedges cut out of them facing the center point and three black angles on a white background. The illusory contours defined by these shapes creates a white triangle in the liminal negative space. This is a metaphor for 'cyberspace' in that it is defined by illusory boundaries and yet is intangible.
 
        The 'idea' of the triangle exists. But in actuality it is defined by the interaction of the shapes and our mind's perception. This is the simplest symbol as yet I have found to describe 'cyberspace'.

        - necessity breeds invention and the world has a dire necessity for change.
        - the human/machine network is the victory of information.
        - the internet is at the same anational and a nation unto itself.
        - cyberspace exists between the nodes of the network. it is the meta-space defined by the exchange of information between users.
        - the internet defines cyberspace by it’s own expanding and mutable boundaries.
        - the movements of cyberspace encroach on meatspace. in this way the net is always moving into the real world.

(once upon a time)
you thought MODERNIST STYLE was worthy of your
ATTENTION and CURIOSITY.
Yes, perhaps it’s been awhile since MODERNIST STYLE last took you out for a nice dinner or really looked into your eyes, like really looked into your eyes, but we humbly suggest it may be about that time you basically ignored MODERNIST STYLE when it clearly needed to have a serious talk about what happened back there, or that time you forgot to bring that special goat cheese back from the store, the kind that MODERNIST STYLE wanted to warm up and put on some lightly dressed arugula for a simple but satisfying supper.
We can reconfigure works from other time periods through modernist methods. Modernism therefore becomes a DIGITAL STRATEGY that can inform
project development,
tool building,
visualization design, &
textual interpretation.
WHAT MIGHT IT LOOK LIKE TO READ OTHER MOVEMENTS AND CENTURIES THROUGH METHODS LATENT IN MODERNISM?
Might
we then be able to extract
a true theory of modernism—
A MODERNIST MODE OF ANALYSIS?
The heightened reflexivity purchased by trying to develop MODERNIST TOOLS for MODERNIST TEXTS and MODERNIST CULTURES will ensure that the SPECTER of MODERNISM in all its
aesthetic and
historical and
spatial particularity
will be more VIVID & THERE at every stage of a
project.
Might
we BOIL down
the realist novel
or
the bildungsroman
or
the scientific romance
or
the epic poem
or
the manifesto
or
the stream-of-consciousness novel
into SETS
of
natural expressions
or
tags
or
metadata
or
protocols
or
applications
that we can use to
TRANSLATE texts into different genres?
GENRES BECOME ALGORITHMS
A MACHINIC NARRATOLOGY
Isn’t this still rather metaphorical, you ask.
OF COURSE.
But the figurations are natively literary
(natively-literary-studies).
Do get back to us when you assemble persuasive arguments that consist exclusively of things that PROVABLY exist in front of you right now. Perhaps you can drop them on your foot or run into them to ensure they are not metaphors.
Send pictures of the bruises!
Let loose generic imperatives and literary movements and lists of formal characteristics of modernism. They do not need euthanasia; they need to get let out in the air, out of their cells, deployed through digital humanities approaches to deform texts of interest.
We continue to invest in the heavy industry of making machines out of literary theory.
It’s okay, really.
When was the last time you wrote/said/argued,
“Jameson/Latour/Haraway/Agamben/Sedgwick/D&G wrote/said/argued”?
Probably yesterday.
Don’t let’s lie to each other
anymore.
So in addition to importing interpretive machines from other disciplines, use those detested periodizations *
* you don’t really detest them, btw, it just sounds legit & heavy when you interrogate, problematize, and complicate them
as imperatives that invade other periods, other genres.
We can DECOUPLE
methodological strategies from
the content of the objects
we study.
Or RECOUPLE them
sure, whatever.
So long as you rekindle that
FLAME
with MODERNIST STYLE,
we’re just happy
you’re happy.

Sections of agricultural fields planted with non-transgenic crops, alternating with transgenic crops. This is thought to limit the rate of resistance mutation caused in susceptible insect and weed species by gene transfer from GE mono-culture crops.

Bad Subjects Production Team
Issue #18, January 1995
Introduction
In September of 1993, the Bad Subjects Collective published 'A Manifesto for Bad Subjects,' in which we offered a critique of existing leftist politics. We argued that the Left today is characterized by cynicism, an investment in multiculturalism which emphasizes separatism, and a desire to compensate for its ineffectiveness by celebrating victimization and marginalization. At that time, Bad Subjects was just beginning to establish a presence on the Internet by organizing an e-mail list and setting up a gopher site where an electronic version of our publication is available. Through these avenues, our manifesto reached an audience larger than we had ever imagined possible. We received responses from as far away as Russia and New Zealand; the manifesto was even taught in classes across the United States. It has now become clear that Bad Subjects identity and popularity are largely a result of our on-line presence. While hard copies of the publication continue to be circulated, the vast majority of our readers come to us through the Internet.

In the manifesto, we recommended that leftist politics be more relevant to our everyday lives; in this way, we hoped to suggest a new relationship between personal and political commitments. Because our everyday life as bad subjects takes place largely on the Net, we want to offer an example of how to put this recommendation into practice. Whereas the Internet was once just a way for us to disseminate our articles, it has now become an important social context for the exchange and development of what on-line users have dubbed badsubjectian ideas. In short, cyberspace has become both an organizing tool and meeting place for bad subjects. It has also come to resemble — in some ways — the kind of Utopian community we imagined in our original manifesto. What follows represents our collective effort to explore the radical potential of cyberspace, while acknowledging its limitations.

Cyberspace and Global Capital
Cyberspace is the technological fetish of the moment, just as the telephone, automobile, radio, and television once were. In this sense, cyberspace can be said to represent the next logical step in the expansion of the mass media. Throughout the 20th Century, leftists from the Frankfurt School to contemporary critics such as Douglas Kellner and Todd Gitlin have been debating whether the mass media are a progressive or reactionary force. There has always been a danger that the mass media will only function as propaganda for the ruling classes. But at the same time, independent uses of mass media by radical groups have been cited as examples of the subversive potential of cheap technologies which can help organize and inform the masses.

Popular histories of the Internet generally underscore its chaotic and seemingly unreal structure. An Esquire magazine guide to getting on-line (December, 1994) by Phil Patton is typical, describing a dizzying landscape...whose ruling philosophy is complexity theory — the happy belief that this chaos will all sort itself out somehow, someday, and meanwhile, hey, go with the flow. ARPANET, the seed from which the Internet grew, was one of the US Department of Defenses innumerable Cold-War projects. Pattons history of the Internet parallels that of most other popular accounts in noting that its military origins did not prevent it from being appropriated by civilians. As the net became a means of communication, Patton writes, on its margins, just as beside the railroad or blacktop, a new culture began to sprout. Despite its historical connection to American nationalist politics, the Internet is perceived to be a place where anarchy reigns: state-planning created the Internet, but has now lost control over it.

Discussions of the Internets radical potential have tended to focus on this anarchic quality. Commentators have celebrated the ways in which the Internet has frustrated attempts by centralized powers to steer its development in a particular direction. Understandably, leftists wary of state power have agreed with them. But celebrating the chaos of the Internet comes dangerously close to celebrating the so-called free market of capitalism. The free market is supposed to be a space of productive chaos inimical to regulation. Ideally it functions all by itself without any political or economic steering. The free market promotes individualism; indeed, it is thought to function best when it encompasses a great diversity of tastes and needs. Moreover, the free market is a fiction which disguises the web of unequal social relationships constituting it.

Substituting the word cyberspace for free market in these descriptions allows us to see that what we value about cyberspace resembles what the Left has criticized about capitalism. Like global capitalism, computer networks bring people together in alienation rather than solidarity. People who interact on-line are generally not privy to the way those networks are produced by actual people existing within a concrete economic order. Cyberspace is a commodity in the process of being produced by programmers, paid system operators, and a range of volunteers who parcel out memory to users, generate more complicated interactive data spaces, and maintain order on newsgroups, mailing lists, and FTP sites. The Net is not antithetical to the free market, to consumerism, or to alienated labor. After all, science fiction author William Gibson invented the term cyberspace to describe virtual reality in a future dominated by multinational corporations and wealthy elites who prey on a vast, international underclass.

While communities in cyberspace might have radical potential, it is important to keep in mind that such potential is not inherent to the medium itself. Cyberspace is not itself a community; many types of communities exist on computer networks, most of which are nothing more than an extension of the kinds of routine interactions we expect to encounter in capitalism. On Usenet and the World Wide Web, for example, we encounter thinner and thinner boundaries between personal expression, politics, and advertising. There are newsgroups devoted simply to job listings. On World Wide Web, you might click on a word in the middle of an article about progressive politics in Slovenia and find yourself linked to an infoblurb promoting tourism in Eastern Europe. On-line galleries exist in a number of locations for the purposes of selling art, music, or text. Thus, the Internet reflects the economic and social conditions that underpin it.

In our excitement over the Internets potential, we must be wary of buying into the ideology of the free market it mirrors. If we value the Internet because it is chaotic, decentered, and promotes individuality for its own sake, then it is only a matter of time before we start to value the free market for the same reasons.

Democracy Is Not Utopia
Promises of a good society offered by cybernetic communication are familiar to us by now. They come out of what we might call the democratic Utopianism espoused by everyone from techno-anarchists like the staff of Mondo 2000 to self-styled conservative futurist Newt Gingrich. Like the fiction of a free market, on-line democratic Utopianism is heavily informed by a belief that unhindered personal expression is the measure of our social freedom.

In on-line democratic Utopianism, cyberspace community ends up emulating political communities in physical reality. Hence, the drawbacks of actually existing democracy as we know it in the United States are prevalent in computer networks: the middle- and upper-classes constitute the largest and most vocal group, promoting their own interests without having to pay attention to the needs and desires of the underclasses and disenfranchised groups. Much has been made, for example, of the way politicians, local governments, and special interest groups can have town hall meetings in virtual reality and hear from the people. But on the Net, after all, one pays for the privilege of participating in any town hall meeting. Moreover, cyberspace runs the risk of becoming individualist to the point of parody, where personal expression is overvalued so much that it is impossible to assert anything unless it begins with the cyberslang disclaimer IMO [in my opinion].

An overemphasis on the personal has led to many of the problems leftists face today when they try to organize themselves as a mass community once more. Personal or identity politics have led to distrust of all groups which attempt to take a strong, unified stance which might appeal to mainstream society. Multiculturalism has helped Americans to modify their interpersonal relations — making it rude and often illegal to be racist or sexist — but it has also undermined our ability to view the political as political. Lacking a clear vision of politics which go beyond the personal, the Left shies away from any program or set of goals which assert that large numbers of people can change society for the better. Whose society are you talking about? the multiculturalist might ask. Hearing that this society is one we all share, the multiculturalist disgustedly replies, No such society exists, and if it did, it would be oppressive. Certainly this is the case if all politics are merely personal, since no two people can share the same life. But politics go beyond individual experience.

To bring about a more just society, the left must commit to a politics which validate personal identity while at the same time transcending it. For this reason, the potential for political community in cyberspace seems particularly salient. On a computer network, identity as we know it in our daily lives is altered. Because we cannot instantly see each other as races, genders, ages, etc., in a computer environment, peoples impulse to judge one another as such is hindered. We could never argue that these judgments do not occur, and certainly many people on-line make sure to identify themselves somewhere on the multiculturalist spectrum. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to assert that radical communities on-line would not fall out along the same lines as they might in physical reality.

Computer networks are, as many commentators have noted, global, or, at the very least, international. Indeed, since going on-line, the Bad Subjects mailing list and readers have been made up of people from around the world. A radical community in cyberspace would, therefore, be constituted by a population united by their desire to affect more than simply their cultural group or national region. Insofar as people can choose how, or if, to represent their (multicultural) identities on-line, cyberspace may provide the ultimate forum for performative identities. That is, a woman on-line might perform the identity of a man, and vice versa. In some ways, we might be tempted to celebrate this, arguing that such a performance undermines the allegedly fixed nature of race, gender, ethnicity, etc.. Such on-line performances take us, perhaps, a small step beyond multiculturalism as we now know it.

What remains fixed, however, are the sites from which on-line access is made available. E-mail address suffixes such as org [organization], gov [government] and edu [education] locate the user within a system of commercial, state, and educational networks. Outside the United States, users are also identified by a country code in their suffix. Although anonymous servers exist which can erase users addresses, these are not entirely foolproof, and their use is limited. This suggests that while multicultural identities can be temporarily transcended (or reinscribed) in cyberspace, work — or class — identities cannot. Cyberspace identities may suggest a post-multicultural and post-national world, but they do not entirely escape their social context.

The Use of Liberal 'Safe Spaces'
Built into the structure of any radical politics is an injunction to form communities. We know for certain that social change is dependent upon teamwork — and the kind of teams we form as radicals can, ideally, become the blueprints for what a better society might look like. Unfortunately, leftist and other radical communities are notorious for their instability and hypocrisy. In the late 60s, the New Left and civil rights movements spawned the womens movement precisely because, to women and their allies, sexist behavior in these movements seemed so clearly in conflict with their stated goals of equality and social justice. Subsequently, the womens movement and other civil rights groups of the 70s, 80s, and 90s have asserted that the personal is political in order to encourage continuity between political convictions and everyday actions.

The limitations of a multiculturalist position are, in part, the impetus behind our ongoing commitment to Bad Subjects. The project of Bad Subjects has always been to provide a forum for the discussion of leftist politics and, out of that, to build a political community and promote social change. While the hard-copy publication offers a place for people to articulate a substantial and coherent position on an aspect of contemporary culture, the on-line mailing list is a space where people can discuss, more informally, 'political education for everyday life.' On the list, people debate the possible ways in which the Left might be more effective at both understanding and transforming contemporary society. It resembles, therefore, a kind of 'safe space' or 'support group' that allows for the free exchange of ideas and positions. While only a few list members may participate at any given time, the messages are 'bounced' to the 200 or so people who currently subscribe to the list. Even when people do not agree with each other, one result is the on-going production of a 'badsubjectian' position on whatever happens to be the topic at hand. The mailing list, therefore, collectively articulates a position (albeit sometimes a provisional one) on a topic. By participating, list members are acting in ways that suggest the kind of political community the Bad Subjects collective has always tried to work towards.

This kind of free exchange can have its limitations, however. As with any 'safe space' there is a need to be aware of the extent to which containing political discussions within places like the mailing list can give us a false sense of our power to transform society. One problem is that the free exchange of ideas can quickly turn into a debate where every position is considered equally valid. While most people on the list are already committed to leftist politics, discussions occasionally become mired in the kind of individualism mentioned earlier, precluding the possibility of criticism or the articulation of a more coherent, and, ultimately, useful position. While a degree of 'liberal pluralism' — where everyone's opinion is equally valued and respected — is necessary, and the safe space of the list allows for, and, indeed, promotes, such a dynamic, there is a time where a stand needs to be taken in order for any substantial change to be possible.

While discussions on the Bad Subjects mailing list may suggest a kind of collective politics, there is need to distinguish between the feeling of political community that a list can generate, and the ability to make productive use of that community to enact material changes in the world. As with any support group, there is, moreover, a need to leave the group behind and use the techniques and knowledge gained from the list in our lives outside of cyberspace. Indeed, there are many social and political changes that the list makes possible. The exchange of ideas can, and often does, promote a shift in consciousness that contains within itself real material effects. Many people on the list are students, professors, or writers, who use ideas and resources from the list, for example, to change the ways in which they teach and learn in their respective professions.

We need to create a balance between the liberal pluralism found in places like the mailing list and the kind of radical politics that can effectively transform society. There is nothing inherently radical, after all, about either multiculturalism or liberal pluralism. Indeed, both frequently reinforce — by creating 'alternative' or 'niche' markets — the structures of capitalism that we aim to dismantle. While it is, of course, important to be conscious of many social and political perspectives, we must also self-consciously maintain a position that opposes, rather than validates, the structures and ideology of capitalism.

The kinds of interactive discussions taking place on the mailing list break down the boundary between producers and consumers of ideas and actions. Our desire is not to merely reach a mass audience whom we can educate, in other words, but to encourage people to act in the world to effect real social change. We work to make possible a world in which on-line members are not merely passive recipients of 'badsubjectian' ideas, but active agents helping us to articulate such a position and enact it in the world at large. Self-consciousness about the political potential of cyberspace is, thus, not an end in itself. We must leave the Net behind and use it only as an impetus for social change in the 'real' material world.

A Radical Program for Cyberspace
Cyberspace community is just another form of community, with all its potential pitfalls and triumphs. The form that a community takes is ultimately not the point — but what you do with that community is. And this is why we believe that on-line and real life communities are not in opposition to one another, or in a hierarchical relationship. These communities exist in relation to each other, and are in the process of making each other quite different as a result of their relationship. Real communities may have invented cybercommunities, but at this point there are real communities and relationships which have been forged in cyberspace. Hence, cyberspace and real society are in a dialectical relationship — they mutually create and influence each other.

The materialist dialectic of Marxist tradition is often interpreted to mean a set of relationships in which materiality is the most important factor. This, as many theorists have pointed out, depends on how you define materiality. As much as cyberspace would seem to be the realm of ideas, hence non-material, one needs to remember that there is a materiality to cyberspace. If there were no such materiality, we could not assert that some people have access to it while others do not. Nor could we compare the structure of cyberspace to the structure of capitalism, which is a notoriously materialistic system. Like all raw materials, cyberspace is unequally distributed throughout the world. Hence cyberspace has materiality and an ideology — there are actual ports, machines, and RAM; and there are beliefs we have about it and ways we behave in it. Cybercommunity, like real life community, is a combination of raw materials and human conviviality.

It is therefore reasonable to assume that radical politics in cyberspace do have a relationship to practices in non-virtual reality. A radical political program in cyberspace would recommend actions intended to equalize access to its raw materials and information. It would promote localized and global participation in the maintenance of cyberspace society, or its structure and laws. Finally, it would open up avenues by which anti-capitalist thought might be disseminated and national boundaries eroded. All these actions would have as their intended goal the construction of a future, Utopian society in which human identities are global and people are united by a commitment to justice, shared labor, socialized property, and the peaceful resolution of conflicts.

For the present, cyberspace is in its infancy. In critical discussions, often we speak of potential ways cyberspace might develop as a technology and as a social force. To theorize cyberspace is also to imaginatively project ourselves as a society into the future. Cyberspace is more than just a system of computers; it is also a network of human relationships in the process of emerging. What is Utopian about cyberspace at this point in history is that its structure is obviously not entirely fixed. Perhaps, in deciding how we wish to organize the future of cyberspace, we can teach ourselves that, indeed, the future of human society is not fixed either. We can always choose to be different, and more importantly, we can always choose to be better. Like cyberspace itself, this manifesto is an invitation to remember that, as individuals and as a society, this choice is always ours.

 “eBlack Studies”
 
 

The term “eBlack Studies” describes the ongoing application of current digital information technology towards the production, dissemination, and collection of historical knowledge critical to the discipline of Black Studies and to the overall black experience.  Thus, eBlack Studies, as it is now understood, is widely recognized to be at the forefront of research in Black Studies.  Keeping this in mind, we – a group of Black Studies scholars from across the United States – first gathered together at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in July 2008 for the inaugural eBlack Studies workshop.  The objectives of this workshop were twofold: to promote digital scholarship in black studies by building a cooperative research network, and to create an agenda for eBlack Studies within the academy as well as within the diverse communities where scholars of color presently work.

The breadth and depth of work represented by the scholars gathered at this meeting broadly define the intersections of Black Studies and emerging issues of digital technology. Our intellectual, community, and activist interests include: Afrofuturism, architecture, archival science and preservation, the Black Arts Movement, bibliometrics, critical race theory, cultural geography, cyberorganizing, ecotourism, environmental justice, genealogy, information seeking behaviors, information management, interpersonal communication,  library and information science, public history and memory, rhetoric and composition, urban and regional planning, and US/Africa foreign policy.  We have also committed ourselves to work in a number of related fields of study including but not limited to: Afro-Latin America and Latino/a Studies, Archaeology, Black Atlantic Studies, Black Queer Studies, Comparative Literature, Cultural Studies, Ethnomusicology, Psychology, Public Health, and Women and Gender Studies.

As we chart the future of scholarship, teaching, and community work through the use of eBlack Studies, we acknowledge and celebrate our roots in the history and traditions of Black Studies, while, at the same time, we enthusiastically embrace digital culture as it critically interrogates, interprets, defines, and documents the experiences of people of African descent.  Furthermore, like Black Studies, eBlack Studies is unquestionably grounded in the history and everyday experiences of living Black communities, and is wholly committed to the preservation and accessibility of Black knowledge, history, experience, and perspective for the continued education of Black people and all people.   We work to promote eBlack Studies as an interdisciplinary study of Black life and information communications technology across the African Diaspora based on an engaged model of praxis-centered, community advocacy.  eBlack Studies will commit itself to knowledge creation and dissemination, dialogue, debate, engagement, and action in the interests of freedom for Black people in the US and the entire African Diaspora.  As such, eBlack Studies will make a powerful contribution towards creating a better world for all peoples.  eBlack Studies will work to cross the vast digital divide across ethnicities and transform the technological systems that structure Black life, as well as the patterns of political, economic, and cultural power relations that influence technology design, production, and use.

We believe that eBlack Studies is a movement which is integral to the future of the discipline of Black Studies, and that this future will include utilizing, innovating, interrogating, critiquing, and where needed, resisting digital tools and spaces. As we chart this future, we believe that Library and Information Sciences are also essential to the development of eBlack Studies.  Not only will eBlack Studies be at the vanguard for work in Black Studies, it will also contribute to its future through the development of digital archives, while documenting the history of Black Studies and the Black experience.

We believe that eBlack Studies and Black Studies in general must reaffirm scholarly commitment to the wide-ranging diversity in Black experiences.  As eBlack Studies holds promise to innovate and develop new directions for Black Studies, it also presents an opportunity to standardize our disciplinary procedures and policies as well as to rejuvenate our pedagogy and practice. The innovations we collectively achieve in these areas will offer unique possibilities for other disciplines, as well.  Finally, the weaving of Black Studies and new information technologies offers profound possibilities for the future of the field, including:
 Preservation of the many modes and facets of the Black experience in digitally archived, easily accessible, open source formats.

Collaborative, interdisciplinary approaches to scholarship, teaching and learning.

Intersectional approaches to scholarship and action, emphasizing the linkages that persist among class, sexuality, nationality and forms of oppression, while promoting strategies for action and liberation.

The aggregation and compilation of reports from the outposts of struggle throughout the world providing testimony to scholars, activists and laypeople.

The active pursuit of connections with scholars of the Black experience and practitioners in areas such as the hard sciences, computer sciences, history of science, engineering, media studies, economics, media production, performance studies, fine arts, and other disciplines not typically associated with work in Black Studies.  New ways of imagining connection and kinship must also engage with professional organizations such as the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ), transnational grassroots organizations, and non-governmental organizations.  We must work to insure that an understanding of the Black experience be more than a mere conversation among academics.

Utilization of all the available means of digital technologies such as social networking, data mining, the Internet, and others engaged in our scholarship, teaching, curriculum development, and community engagement, not just for our own personal and professional purposes, but to strengthen connections with Black communities around the world.

Interrogation and critique of technological systems and tools.

Advocacy as well as description in our intellectual work.

Utilization of models of scholarship and engagement that reach beyond traditional academic work and academic systems of financing, reward, and recognition.


We are witnessing an information revolution – a revolution that is leading global transformation.  People of African descent have always played pivotal roles in the history of technological revolutions – sometimes as innovators and inventors, more frequently as laborers – and whose labor permitted the wealth that spurred further technological advances.  The social consequences of today's information revolution include suffering and economic insecurity for African Americans and others in the African Diaspora, and also dislocations among others in society.  Our communities have been digitally divided but we are dedicating ourselves to serve as a bridge over the river of that divide.  Our social values are cyberdemocracy, collective intelligence, and information freedom.  We embrace the information revolution and dedicate our scholarship to academic excellence and social responsibility.  We welcome others to join us in this endeavor.
