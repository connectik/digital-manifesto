        <p>The Digital Manifesto Archive is an academic resource dedicated to aggregating and cataloging manifestos that fall under two basic criteria:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Manifestos that focus on the political and cultural dimensions of digital life</li>
            <li>Manifestos that are written, or are primarily disseminated, online</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The manifesto genre is, by definition, timely and politically focused. Further, it is a primary site of political, cultural, and social experimentation in our contemporary world. Manifestos that are created and disseminated online further this experimental ethos by fundamentally expanding the character and scope of the genre.</p>
        <p>Each category listed on the archive is loosely organized by theme, political affiliation, and (if applicable) time period. While the political movements and affiliations of the manifestos archived in each category are not universal, each category does try to capture a broad spectrum of political moods and actions with regard to its topic.</p> 
		<p>This site is meant to preserve manifestos for future research and teaching. The opinions expressed by each author are their own.</p>
        <p>This project is open source. You can see gwhigs' work for the site here: <a href="https://github.com/gwhigs/digital-manifesto"> Digital Manifesto Archive @ Github.com</a></p>
